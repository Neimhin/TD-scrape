#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	What has been exposed at Tallaght hospital is perhaps the best example of the national failure of this Government.  It is one of the best examples of the abject failure of the Minister for Health and Children to live up to the responsibility for immediate care that was given to her following her appointment to that position.  It is unconscionable that a number of people — more than twice the population of County Leitrim — should not have their X-rays read over a four year period.  It smacks of a gigantic cover up that only those who had problems would be informed.  We now know that one person has died, another is being treated for cancer and there is a possibility that many people are walking around with undetected tumours or other problems because X-rays have not been read by radiologists.This follows a long litany of incompetence and disaster presided over by the Government in the Department of Health and Children and in other Departments.  Will the Minister come into the House today to answer questions about this?  Is she in New Zealand a week before St. Patrick's Day?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that she took appropriate action when it was brought to her attention by the chief executive of Tallaght hospital last December and flagged by GPs last summer?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	7	X-rays should normally be seen and formally reported by a consultant radiologist.  However, since that does not appear to have happened, all the relevant X-rays are being examined by consultant radiologists on a precautionary basis.  In the great majority of these cases, the X-rays were seen by doctors involved in their care, such as in orthopaedics where the doctors in the fracture clinic would look at the X-rays while seeing the patient.  However, this practice was below appropriate clinical standards.The CEO of the hospital got involved to clear the backlog following his appointment in December 2009.  The CEO arranged for the additional consultants and administrative support.  He monitored the situation through weekly progress reports that show the backlog was reduced from 57,921 to 23,169 by 9 March.  He now states that the backlog will be cleared entirely by May 2010.This problem originally came to light in early 2009.  It appears that there are two patients who had a delayed diagnosis within this cohort.  One of these patients is under treatment in the hospital for cancer.  The other patient died at the hospital last summer, and the CEO was only made aware of this yesterday.  He is reviewing the file on the cause of death.  For any patient who needs a review of a diagnosis as a result of the review of the X-rays, all the necessary services will be made available immediately by the hospital.The HSE has announced that it is to carry out an investigation into the circumstances that led to the accumulation of unreported X-rays at Tallaght hospital, that is, X-rays not read by radiologists.  The investigation is to be chaired by a person independent of Tallaght hospital and the HSE.  The details of the investigation will be announced in the coming days.  The CEO of Tallaght hospital, Professor Conlon, supports the investigation and the HSE is fully supportive of Professor Conlon and the management team at Tallaght hospital in dealing with the outstanding X-rays.The Department of Health and Children has worked with the HSE on the development of a serious incident management protocol, and it has guided the clinical management of this issue.  This protocol puts patients' interests first and foremost in all actions to be taken.  The Minister has provided the accountability mechanisms, such as HIQA, which ensure that where incidents arise, they are properly dealt with.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is very difficult to verbalise the impact on people who had X-rays carried out in Tallaght hospital and who possibly have serious problems.  We know that one person is being treated for cancer and that another person died.  There may well be some who have tumours that have not been detected because the X-ray has not been read by a radiologist.Can the Taoiseach supply me with the list of engagements of the Minister for Health and Children that deal with Enterprise Ireland and the creation of jobs here?  I take his point about Ministers going abroad to deal with job creation for our country.The Taoiseach states that the Minister has done much work in setting up HIQA and so on.  However, this problem was flagged in 2008 and it was brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE that there was a shortage of radiologists in Tallaght Hospital.  According to the facts supplied to me by Deputy Hayes, Tallaght hospital has 631 beds.  There are 78,843 attendances at the accident and emergency department and 226,493 attendancesat the outpatients' department.  They have 12 radiologists.  St. Vincent's Hospital has 16 radiologists and Cork University Hospital has 12.My problem with the Government is that while this catastrophe unfolds around us its Minister for Health and Children is in New Zealand but she has a duty of immediate care that when something is brought to her attention she should act swiftly and in the best interests of the people and of our country.  What did she do?  She washed her hands of it and decided not to meddle, and we know that one patient died last year.Why were radiologists from across Dublin not called in to deal with this backlog?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that this practice of X-rays being taken and not read by radiologists for six, eight, ten or 12 weeks, or six months, is not continuing in other hospitals throughout the country?  Can he confirm that the reason this practice was not exposed until now is that there was no intention of telling individual patients about their X-ray with the exception of those who had a serious problem?  Can he confirm also that he is happy with what the Minister for Health and Children did in this respect because she said it was not appropriate for her to meddle in this matter, find out anything or take action that would ensure this will not happen again?  Is the Taoiseach happy with his Minister for Health and Children and the action she took?  Obviously, he cannot move her from the Cabinet because he cannot rely on her vote.  This is a national catastrophe and is the best example of abject and blatant failure by the Taoiseach's Government and his Ministers.  Is the Taoiseach happy that the Minister took appropriate action to deal with a national scandal?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The concern is as follows.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Who is responsible for it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I want to make the position clear.  When a serious incident such as this one arises the first action that must happen is that the practice stops or, in this case, what was not happening should begin to happen, to make sure that the 30,000 new patients coming in in recent months are properly attended to and that their X-rays are signed off by a radiologist.  That was happening.  The second part of the issue is to make sure that a clinical review is done.  There is no suggestion or question of a cover up.  We must be clear about this.  What is then done is that in the interests of patient care a full clinical review is carried out, all of those X-rays are examined and if there are people affected they should be notified, having completed a clinical review.  We can then say to everybody else that they are not affected in any way by this and the people who have been identified who must be spoken to are spoken to, as well as their families.  That is the primary focus of what must be done.Let us be clear about this issue.  There have been 790,000 X-rays conducted in Tallaght hospital in the period we are discussing.  If we were talking about making this issue known before the clinical review is conducted we would be trying to find out if the 790,000 people who had those X-rays were affected.  The issue is that we conduct a clinical review in respect of those who were not signed off by radiologists and inform those people.There are delayed diagnoses in two of the 37,000 or 38,000 cases that have already been reviewed.  In that context, considering that the spectrum of risk in respect of error in radiology could be anything between 2% and 20%, that would indicate, as a general statement, and not taking away from the individual concern of any family that might be affected by this, that the cohort of X-rays relate to relatively low risk cases because there have been two out of a total of 38,000.  Obviously, we have yet to have investigated precisely whether that delayed diagnosis affected outcomes, and that is something that will have to be dealt with clinically by qualified people.In regard to the remainder that can be done by the end of May, if we were to proceed as has been proceeded with, and added resources have been provided since the chief executive officer came into the job on 15 December, what we are getting to then is a position where we will identify what will hopefully be a very low number and deal with those people specifically and be in a position to tell everyone else that they are not affected.  The contention Deputy Kenny seems to be making is that by going about it in that way it was in some sense an attempt at a cover-up.  It is not.  It is an attempt to ensure that the focus is on the concern of patients——

The protocol sets out that we first identify if there is a need for the service to cease to ensure that any new patients are not affected and, second, identify if there are any patients who have been through the system who need to be followed up to have their care reviewed or amended.  That is in the process of being done currently.  Third, when the clinical needs of these patients have been met and they have been informed, we then proceed with carrying out an inquiry as to whether there are wider lessons to be learned and applied.

There is only one responsibility at issue here and that is the responsibility to the people who went into Tallaght hospital to have an X-ray taken.  As the Taoiseach said, there were more than 700,000 X-rays done in that period of time and I imagine that almost every one of those patients is worried about whether their X-ray was one of the 58,000 not examined by a radiologist.  I understand 23,000 X-rays have not yet been reviewed.  The first priority is to get those reviewed as quickly as possible and I want the Taoiseach to tell me how quickly that will be done.Second, the people concerned who went in to that hospital for X-rays must be told whether there were X-rays included in these 58,000 that were not examined, given the all-clear if that is the case or told that there is a problem.  That must be done as a matter of urgency.The Taoiseach said this matter came to light in early 2009 and there is other information that it was coming to light in 2008.  We are told general practitioners were making inquiries about this matter as far back as last summer yet it would appear that nothing was done about it until the new chief executive was appointed to the hospital in December when he found out about it.  Having listened to his interview this morning, I presume somebody told him there was a big problem with X-rays that had not been examined by radiologists.  He took some action to deal with it.  What happened between the time somebody in the hospital found out that this was the practice and the time the new chief executive found out?  Why was it not dealt with until the new chief executive was appointed?The new chief executive says he told the Minister for Health and Children about the matter in December of last year but the Minister said this morning she did not really know the scale of the problem until yesterday.  I find this unbelievable.  Problems arose in Portlaoise hospital, Cork University Hospital and Ennis General Hospital and a number of reports were issued by HIQA.  Over a period there has been a series of misdiagnoses and tests that were not followed through and the right people did not look at the files, etc.  Questions must be asked if the chief executive of Tallaght hospital told the Minister for Health and Children that there was a big problem with X-rays and she did not even inquire as to the extent of it or make an inquiry.Dr. Muiris Houston, in his article in The Irish Times this morning, states: “If such a significant failure can occur in one of the State’s premier teaching hospitals and not be addressed for over four years, it may well have happened in other hospitals also.”  One would imagine that if the Minister for Health and Children was told in December by the new chief executive of Tallaght hospital that there was a big problem with X-rays, she would have inquired into how many X-rays were involved, how big the problem was and what needed to be done about it.  She did not make such inquiries or inquire into how her Department or the HSE could help to resolve it and she told us she only found out about the full scale of the problem yesterday.  After all we have heard before, that is just incredible.  I find it difficult to understand why it did not dawn on the Minister that, if there was a problem of the size in question in Tallaght, there might be a problem somewhere else, thus meriting an investigation across the health service into whether there were other X-rays that were not being examined.There is in Tallaght hospital a medical problem and a human problem for those involved.  It needs to be addressed urgently and I urge that this be done.  There is also a political problem.  We have had enough and this country has had enough of the mismanagement of the health service.  Nothing is done about the things that go wrong in the health service when they are discovered; they are only addressed when they become public.  We are not hearing about inquiries and investigations and what went wrong.  It is the same pattern all the time; it is only when a problem enters the public domain and becomes a public issue that there is a big flurry of activity.  When reshuffling his Cabinet, will the Taoiseach appoint a new Minister for Health and Children?

Portlaoise hospital was mentioned previously.  I am acquainted with the issues that arise there.  It was as a result of what happened in that hospital that a need arose to provide eight centres of excellence for the provision of cancer care and triple assessment.  I recall the debate in this House on that issue.  The record will show what was said.  I heard very many people argue for the retention of status quo in a debate in this House, even in the aftermath of what had happened in Portlaoise.

This has been confirmed in recent weeks by a HIQA report.  The support for the reform and change in facing up to the issue was not uniform in the House at the time in question.Rather that criticising the Minister for being reactive, one should acknowledge she has been most proactive in trying to bring forward reforms in the health sector that are necessary and politically difficult and which do not always win support.  When we see systems failures and difficulties in the health service, Members are quick to question in the House what is happening and the nature of the accountability mechanisms, and rightly so, but when people are involved in the reform of the health service and doing what is necessary to bring about better standards and greater cross-assessment and put clinical teams in place, there is very seldom the same uniformity of opinion.

One deals with them by trying to deal with the clinical needs of the patients concerned, as Deputy Gilmore said.The clinical review in Tallaght hospital is being carried out.  It is being conducted by qualified persons such as radiologists to deal with the backlog.  I agree there will have to be an inquiry into why the backlog is so great.  That will have to be dealt with as a wider issue.

The unfortunate problem we now face is that, because only two thirds of the cases have been clinically reviewed, one is not in a position at this stage to eliminate the vast majority of people who need have no fears in regard to the matter.  As we have seen from the 38,000 cases that have already been reviewed, there was a delayed diagnosis in two.People need to be reassured generally as to the level of risk involved.  Deputy Kenny should note the level of risk is of a different nature from that which affected women in Portlaoise hospital in respect of symptomatic breast cancer.  That is the position we are in.To answer Deputy Gilmore's question, the HSE is engaging with Tallaght hospital today to see how we can expedite even further what has been achieved by the hospital thus far in dealing with the issue.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The Taoiseach talks about the level of risk and seeks to give reassurance that it is low.  The truth is that he does not know the level of risk.  There are 14,000 patients who, over the past four years, had a total of 23,000 X-rays carried out at Tallaght hospital that were not examined by a radiologist.  Those X-rays have not yet been reviewed.  Therefore, the Taoiseach does not know the risk.How quickly will the X-rays be reviewed?  How quickly will the individuals concerned be reassured if, as I hope, that is to be the outcome?  Addressing these questions is the first priority.  We need to have some information.  If the Taoiseach cannot provide it now on Leaders' Questions and the Minister for Health and Children is in New Zealand, somebody from the Government needs to tell us the story today and state how quickly the 14,000 cases will be dealt with.Second, the Taoiseach did not answer the question about when the patients will be told.  To the best of my knowledge, none of the patients involved has yet been told that he or she is involved and given full information on the position in regard to his or her X-rays.  Third, the Taoiseach did not answer the question as to what happened in the period between when this issue first came to light and when the new chief executive officer found out about it.  It seems nothing was done in that period, and there must be some explanation of why that was so.Fourth, the Taoiseach has not answered the question as to why the Minister for Health and Children seemed not to take the matter terribly seriously when she was told about it.  She tells us on the radio this morning that she did not know the full extent of it until yesterday and that she relied on the protocols and so on that are in place.  If the Minister for Health and Children was told by the new chief executive officer of a hospital that there was a problem — and told it at a time when the Minister has been in and out of this House and involved in public controversy about misdiagnoses and problems associated with tests not being looked at and so on — I do not understand why she did not go on alert.  What did she do between the time she was told about it in December and now when it has come into the public domain?Finally, does the Taoiseach intend to leave the Minister, Deputy Harney, in her Ministry or will he replace her?  He is apparently considering a reshuffle of his Cabinet.  Some time ago my party tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister arising from some of these earlier incidents.  I have a lot of time for the Minister — she has been a very competent Minister in other ways — but she has been a hopeless Minister for Health and Children and it is time she was moved.

He is about to reshuffle his Cabinet and has an opportunity to tell the people of this country this morning whether he will appoint a new Minister for Health and Children next week, the week after St. Patrick's Day or whenever it is that he will come into the House and announce a reshuffle.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I am not going to go down that road other than to say the Minister, Deputy Harney, has my confidence.  She has been a reforming Minister for Health and Children and has brought about more changes for the reform of the health sector than any of her predecessors.  She has been absolutely committed to bringing forward quality assurance mechanisms in the system so that we have accountability and can deal with any issues that arise.  The response of the Health Information and Quality Authority to the problems recently highlighted in respect of children in care was a result of the accountability mechanisms in place.Having accountability mechanisms is not about presupposing that the system is and will be perfect in every instance and on every day of the week.  In a modern health system hundreds of thousands of clinical decisions are made every year.  Nowhere in the world is it suggested that such a system is error free.  We must make sure that we identify where errors arise, that we mitigate the problem——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The idea that there is a prospect of having a system that works perfectly in every respect is not correct.  It is about making sure that we have a system that is accountable, which identifies issues as they arise, deals with them and ensures lessons are learned from them.  It is about ensuring best practice models are put in place across the system.The great problem of the health system before we began to modernise and reform it was that the hospital system was a stand-alone system rather than a network of facilities that pulled together the various specialties in a way that allowed people access to the best possible health care by ensuring the resource was properly planned and configured.  That process is ongoing.  There has been a greater degree of change in that respect, which has been much to the benefit of the health system and the people who use it, under the Minister, Deputy Harney, than anyone else.  I will stand over that.  Labour Party Members can scoff as much as they wish but the objective facts will show the improvements for patients since we brought in changes.  Those changes are ongoing and more needs to be done in respect of further redeployment, in respect of the move from a hospital-based system to a more community-based system, in driving forward primary care centres throughout the State, in putting in place primary care teams in communities, and in respect of an entire range of structural changes that are fundamental to a modern, sustainable health system that will provide the best possible care rather than assuaging every parochial interest that seems to raise its head in respect of the health system.

At the end of that meeting the Minister wished the chief executive officer, who was previously medical director at the hospital, well in his post.  He mentioned that there was an issue in the radiology department which he intended to get to the bottom of and deal with.  Professor Conlon has the Minister's confidence and he proceeded with putting in place measures, in line with the protocols that were established post-Portlaoise, to deal with the background that had been identified in the radiology department.  Nothing has been done since that would not have been done or should not have been done.The Health Information and Quality Authority accepts that the response in the hospital to the backlog is appropriate and that the numbers of X-rays being read  — of the order of 3,000 to 4,000 per week —  by the extra consultant radiologists who have been employed there is exceptional and appropriate.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, if the present rate of progress continues, it is expected to have this process completed by May 2010.  In the meantime, as a result of this matter now coming into the public domain in the way it has, and before the clinical review has been completed, HIQA is having a discussion today with Tallaght hospital management to see how the process can be further accelerated if possible in an effort to assuage people's concerns.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	84	In regard to the question of the level of risk, I am simply making the point that statistically, based on what we have seen thus far, the fact that there has been a delayed diagnosis in just two of the 38,000 cases is an indication — not a confirmation but an indicative, statistical indication — that we are dealing with relatively low risk.  In regard to the remaining 23,000 that have yet to be looked at, I understand from this morning's interview with the manager of the hospital, Professor Conlon, that 10,000 of those relate to orthopaedic issues which could have emerged from fracture clinics or wherever.  All of those x-rays would have been looked at by the clinician dealing with the patient.  What we are talking about here is a procedure for best practice where those X-rays, having been looked at by the clinician and the patient dealt with accordingly, would have been referred to the radiology department.  Best practice is that the radiologist would look at the X-ray and write a note which in most cases would confirm what was looked at by, in the case of a fracture clinic, the orthopaedic surgeon.What has happened is that in the case of X-rays which were looked at by the clinician dealing with the patient and then referred to the radiology department, six out of 100 of those since 2005 have formed part of a backlog.  That is the investigation that has to take place after we have dealt with the clinical review that is not yet completed.  That is best practice for dealing with this type of issue.

A helpline has been established to deal with concerns people may raise.  The ideal situation would be to allow the clinical review to be completed, and we will see whether that can be accelerated.  I am trying to put the issue in context and to convey to people in a responsible way what one can best say is the level of risk involved in this in order that people, however concerned they can rightly be, are not unduly concerned or unduly put under an anxiety that may not be justified by the circumstances of their case.  I am indicating, that of the 38,000 already looked at, two have resulted in a delayed diagnosis.  We have yet to see whether outcomes were affected because of the delay in diagnosis, rather than because there is any question of a misdiagnosis.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I propose to take Questions Nos.1 to 3, inclusive, together.The review of the Irish public service, "Towards an Integrated Public Service", published in 2008, benchmarked the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and made recommendations as to the further direction of public service reform.  It confirmed the many strengths of the system and identified challenges that needed to be addressed.  Transforming public services represents the blueprint for a new type of unified public service focused on common goals, with greater co-operation and reduced boundaries between sectors, organisations and professions, with a much greater integration of services around user needs and far greater efficiency in internal data sharing and administration through shared service models.Progress has been made in a number of areas to date, including progress in a range of instruments in the human resource area which continue to contribute to the implementation of expenditure savings for this year, notably the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, the special Civil Service career break scheme and the shorter working year scheme, together with the moratorium on the filling of public sector vacancies by recruitment or promotion.  A new e-Government strategy for 2010 has been approved by the Cabinet committee on transforming public services.  The strategy highlights new approaches to overcome some of the difficulties there are with putting certain services on-line and should thereby help to achieve an improvement in the use of electronic means for delivering public services.The national public procurement operations unit, established in 2009, continues to leverage the public service's buying power by organising procurement of common goods and services across the public service.  During 2009, in addition to achieving better value on procurement spend, savings of €27 million were achieved by public bodies with the support of the unit.  It is intended that significant additional savings will be targeted in 2010.  Work is ongoing on specific proposals in the area of shared services on the basis that there are significant potential savings associated with such initiatives.  Work is currently being advanced on shared services in a number of sectors, including human resources, pensions administration, payroll and financial management.The organisational review programme has been extended in order that all Government Departments and major offices will be reviewed within the next three years.  The team, which is based in my Department, carries out and publishes assessments of the capacity of individual Departments and major offices to meet their challenges over the coming years.  Four organisations were reviewed last year — the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Statistics Office and the Property Registration Authority.  These reviews are due to be published shortly and will be accompanied by follow-up action plans on the key findings prepared by each of the four organisations.  An additional three organisations will be reviewed this year, namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My Department will also be reviewed this year, with this review being led by a senior official from the Department of Finance.Work is progressing in regard to the development of new performance and governance frameworks for State agencies and the greater use of service level agreements in this context.  Work is also under way on the establishment of the senior public service to centrally manage and deploy top public servants.  Initially, the service will be introduced in the Civil Service, before being extended across the wider public service.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The Taoiseach made reference to the establishment of a Department to deal with public sector reform.  Regardless of whatever adjustment he makes in the next few weeks, will he address this question by giving responsibility to a Minister or Minister of State to deal with public service reform?  As the Taoiseach is aware, such a position was allocated many years ago to a Minister of State who had specific responsibility for it.  I would like the Taoiseach to refer to his comments in that regard.  He indicated he might close down two Ministries and make a readjustment, with a focus on public sector reform.Has the plan for e-Government to which the Taoiseach referred been published?  Can we get copies of it?  There are serious possibilities for efficiencies and streamlining the manner in which business is done.I and a number of my colleagues raised the matter of public procurement at a meeting with the OECD some weeks ago.  The amount of public procurement tenders which go outside the country is in the order of 17%, compared to the European average which is only 1.7%.  This means that many small businesses cannot tender for business in Ireland.  It is too complex and costly.  As I said before, we are exporting business.  There are serious possibilities in terms of value for money and saving money by implementing a proper system of public procurement.  There are European guidelines and regulations in place but it is an area on which the Taoiseach could usefully focus in order to get a much better response, in terms of efficiency, value and the provision of jobs for many smaller firms in Ireland.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I have not entered into any public or private speculation in regard to any upcoming arrangements regarding how Government is organised and I do not intend to do so here.  On the question of e-Government, according to the latest European Union Commission e-Government benchmarks, Ireland's ranking for on-line sophistication has improved from 17th position in 2007 to joint 7th position, with an equivalent rating to the United Kingdom and Finland.  The same benchmarks place Ireland in the top two countries for e-procurement services.  Examples of on-line services which have been progressed include on-line applications for birth, marriage and death certificates; automatic reminders when driving licences and passports expire; payment of the majority of courts fines electronically; and on-line declarations to the Garda Síochána for minor crimes.  The customer does not need to know the relevant Garda station as back-end processes ensure they are routed correctly.In addition, Ireland is one of the only countries in Europe which has put in place a high-speed national Government network to which all public bodies can connect using any telecommunications operator in the Irish marketplace.  The Department of Finance is currently working with Departments, offices and agencies to develop a rolling programme of e-Government projects.  In this regard, Departments are developing detailed e-Government plans.On the question of public procurement, we had a long discussion on this matter during Leaders' Questions last week.  I do not think I can add anything further to the discussion.  I emphasised the need for as much flexibility as possible to accommodate the SME sector in Ireland to be able to participate in Government procurement.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	90	In respect of specific public service changes, the Taoiseach said he would engage with public service unions to bring about change as speedily as possible, a comment which was made before the collapse in the social partnership talks last year.  The country is now faced with an increasingly uncertain situation whereby public sector workers, including teachers and health care workers, are taking industrial action.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said at the weekend that there was a suggestion that Deputies and councillors who support the Government would in some way be blacklisted by local authority staff.  As this is a matter of considerable public importance, in the context of changes in the delivery of public services is the Government engaging with the trade unions?  Arising from the comments of the Minister for Finance, everybody would like to see a situation whereby services can be provided for people, as would be expected.The Government's task force on the public service recommended that there should be a move to a common public service contract to facilitate personnel moving from one Department to another.  Is there any indication whether that will receive Government support?  Will it require legislation?  Are the heads of any such Bill being prepared?  The task force said there should be a common public service contract in order to facilitate movement from Department to Department and so on.  What is the status and position regarding the task force's recommendation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	As employer, the Government is of course available to engage with its employees and their representatives in regard to any industrial relations matters that arise, and matters certainly arise at present.  Obviously, however, we have to find a realistic basis upon which that engagement can take place.  Using existing and well-established channels of communication regarding the handling of the current dispute provides us with a means of seeking to explore whether that is in fact possible.  The Government has always been very clear that it is interested in having a meaningful dialogue but there is no point for either side in just having a dialogue.  We need to find a realistic basis upon which that engagement can take place, and we are anxious that this becomes possible as soon as is practicable.  The Government has always been and will continue to be of that view.At the same time, the escalation of disputes can force management to become involved in proportionate responses.  As opposed to the current situation, we would rather have people conduct a discussion around a common vision for a reformed public service that will meet the needs of public servants and can best provide for their concerns, both individually and collectively, by trying to find a constructive and positive agenda upon which we can progress matters.On the question of public service contracts, this comes back to being able to deal with these matters against a stable industrial relations background that can best be negotiated and provided for in that context.  The whole question of redeployment and flexibility in regard to where and in what circumstances people can work and provide their skills within the public sector is an issue that would form part of any drive for a modernisation of the public service, on which we would be anxious to engage.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	In the course of a newspaper interview last November, the Taoiseach said there was an urgent need for reform in the public service but that he felt the implementation of it would be in the medium to longer term.  At what point in his 13 years as a Minister and Taoiseach since 1997 did he come to the conclusion there was an urgent need for public service reform?Second, as I was unclear from the reply the Taoiseach gave to Deputy Kenny, is it or is it not the Taoiseach's intention when he reconfigures the Government to appoint a Minister with responsibility for public service reform?  It would appear the appointment of such a ministry at Cabinet level is required in order to drive the reform of public service.  We have had many reports on it and much talk about it but it needs to happen.Third, the Taoiseach referred to the fact organisational reviews had been carried out in a number of Departments and he referred to the Department of Health and Children.  There was a report in the newspapers on 18 February last which purported to come from somebody who saw a copy of the report that has been carried out.  It states that some staff at the Department of Health and Children have little or nothing to do while colleagues are overwhelmed with work but management appears reluctant to deal with the problems.  Is this the case?Finally, the industrial action that is taking place has arisen from the fact that the Taoiseach commenced discussions with the public service trade unions about a reform package.  He then collapsed those discussions, unilaterally cut the pay of the public servants and unilaterally introduced a number of other changes, including changes to pension arrangements.  This has now given rise to the industrial action we have seen taking place since January and which is escalating.  When people try to access various Departments, depending on the day they ring or try to make contact, if it is an industrial action day or afternoon, nobody answers the telephones or there is one kind of problem or another.What I understood the Taoiseach to say to Deputy Kenny is that he does not think the time is yet right for discussions with the trade unions to try to resolve those issues.  How much worse does the industrial action have to get before he will call in the trade unions, have discussions with them, try to resolve the issues and get normal work resumed throughout the various organs of the public service?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The record will show I did not suggest the time was not right for discussions at present.  I am simply saying there is a need to find a realistic basis upon which an engagement can take place.  The Government has been and is available at all times as an employer to discuss matters of interest to its employees' representatives and trade unions.  Obviously, however, we need a realistic basis for that engagement.As I said, the management of the dispute at present involves using well-established channels regarding the management interface with union representatives in an effort to ensure core business is not unduly affected and to avoid further escalation.  The fact is the Government stands ready to engage on a realistic basis.There are many public servants throughout the country who would recognise that there are decisions Government had to take in December which were unavoidable and necessary, and which were the discharge of our duty as a Government in order to bring forward a budget that had credibility and will enable us to proceed.  I recognise, of course, that this did not lead to a negotiated settlement with the unions, despite the best efforts of everyone concerned.  However, there is also the fact that, three months on, there is an agenda we need to address, including modernisation of the public services.  This needs to be conducted on the basis of mutual interest because it is through dealing with those issues and providing greater efficiencies and effectiveness in the service in this way that one does not have to look to other ways of trying to trim the public service pay and pensions bill.To look to the non-pay side of the house is obviously something we would like to do.  We have no wish to go back in regard to the question of pay.  That has never been our intention and if it can be avoided at any cost at all, we will of course consider other options, as we should be and are willing to do.In regard to the Deputy's first question regarding at what stage of my career did I think the public service needed reform, this is an ongoing process.  There have been reforms of the public service and many initiatives have been taken by successive Governments.  None, perhaps, has reached the ambition it set itself, for a whole range of reasons, but it is an ongoing process and to suggest there has been no change in the public service and that we should only now get involved in such change is to do an injustice to the many social partnership agreements that have been signed in which, as the Deputy knows, many modernisation proposals were required as part of the pay arrangements agreed in those agreements, many of which were fulfilled.What has come forward in the OECD report is a wider change agenda that seeks to lower, if one likes, the institutional boundaries between State agencies, bodies and Departments in a whole range of areas.  This requires discussion, negotiation and agreement, and, unfortunately, it has not been possible, for a whole range of reasons, to be able to get onto that agenda as quickly as I am sure everyone would like.  However, the Deputy will know much discussion has taken place around those issues which could be reactivated in the right circumstances, and we have to ascertain whether there is a way in which we can proceed along those lines.  I will be anxious to do so given the right circumstances.Regarding the question of the organisational review programmes, the Deputy referred specifically to the Department of Health and Children.  The reviews are due to be published shortly.  They will be brought to Government and considered and discussed there and it will be a case of what emerges from it.  As is the case in respect of any reform programme, as we have seen with regard to the McCarthy report and other such reviews, the first action is to identify the priority actions in any Department and then to see what level of resources is required.  It is critical for the effective delivery of services to the public to have that flexibility to redeploy staff elsewhere to pressure points in the system, whether in the Department of Social and Family Affairs or in other Departments, where the services are required.  It is a case of trying to find a way in which this can happen more readily than under existing agreements and arrangements and this would certainly improve the situation considerably.I do not wish to speculate about the structure of how Government will organise itself but public service reform is not just the business of one Ministry; it is the business of Government and a whole-Government approach is required.  It is a case of finding a framework in which change and reform can be considered and this would be the best means for achieving a successful outcome to this agenda.

Industrial action is taking place and it is escalating.  It is causing very significant disruption to the delivery of public service, such as in the passport office, in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in local authorities and right across the board.  I do not hear anything from the Taoiseach or anything from anybody on the Government side as to what is being done to try to resolve it.  The Government has a responsibility to ensure that a normal service is delivered to the public and if industrial action is taking place, as there is, the Government has a responsibility to do whatever can be done to resolve that.  I do not see anything being done.  All I see and all that I have seen since the turn of the year is that the industrial action situation is simply getting worse and becoming more widespread and disruptive.  I see no response from the Government and I get no indication from the Taoiseach today that he intends to do anything about it.  It is time we started hearing from Government as to what is going to be done about it or will the Government allow this action to drag on and become worse?  That is my first issue and I ask the Taoiseach to be specific in his reply.In respect of the wider issue of public sector reform, it is one of those issues that keeps being talked about and about which reports are produced but there is very little action.  One of the tragedies is that in the talks between Government and the unions prior to Christmas, there were, as I read it — I read the seven or eight documents most of which had been signed-off or virtually signed-off — reform packages relating to a number of Departments.  They seemed to me to be delivering the most extensive levels of reform seen in the public service for some time.  Yet the Taoiseach collapsed the talks.  What is his understanding now of the status of those documents?  Are they still live or are they dead since the discussions were collapsed?  Does the Taoiseach see any prospect of resuming discussions on those documents?  What is the position?At one stage, there was a Department of the Public Service and very considerable reforms of the public service were achieved in the lifetime of that Department.  It was wound up and subsumed into the Department of Finance.  We now have a Department of Finance which is responsible for the normal budgetary processes, Estimates and now, banking, in addition to responsibility for the public service.  It is widely speculated that the Taoiseach is considering some extensive re-jigging of Departments.  Would he agree there should be a separate Department of the Public Service which would lead a process of reform in the public service and this would be one way of driving forward such reform?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I regard it as a rather simplistic notion to suggest that the structure of the Department of the Public Service is the determining factor as to what level of public service reform can be achieved.  In successive social partnership agreements over the past seven agreements since the era to which the Deputy refers, there has been far more public service reform available under social partnership than there had been by the diktat of any particular Department of the Public Service.

It is unfortunate we were unable to successfully come to an agreement before Christmas; that is a matter of regret.  However, at the end of the day, the Government had a responsibility to discharge and we had to proceed.Both the Deputy and I have acknowledged the extensive work of those talks.  They set out a blueprint for a lot of reforms and changes that are agreed between the parties as being certainly possible, feasible and achievable.  We have to find the right circumstances in which those talks can proceed and I am anxious to see if this is possible.  We all know that with regard to any industrial relations dispute, it is necessary to find a realistic basis upon which we can engage.  It should not be assumed by the Deputy that the Government is indifferent to this issue as the truth is quite the contrary.  The Government is anxious to see an outcome because we do not believe that the industrial action will achieve the objectives it has set itself.  The Government has had to work within a budgetary framework which has been clearly outlined.  We have to find a way in which we can engage proactively with employees in the public and Civil Service to proceed with a modernisation programme which I believe is necessary and will be helpful in addressing the concerns currently being discussed by public servants and their representatives about ways of achieving reform that is responsive to the needs of the people and provides an arrangement for good working conditions for those working in the service.  This has always been the broad agenda.  The context and circumstances may change from time to time but the basic objective of Government is to have a common agenda set out against a settled industrial relations background, in which we can all work together for our mutual interest and satisfaction.

It appears that the Government has no strategy on so-called public service reform and that its actions are all directed in the areas I have described.  Has the Government a strategy?  What are its objectives? What is the strategy and what is the timeframe for it?  Is it an agreed strategy between the component parts of the current coalition?  Will the Taoiseach accept that against the backdrop of pay cuts and embargoes on recruitment and cuts in services, there is little prospect of any serious engagement with the representatives of the public service workers?  Does the Taoiseach agree that he effectively scuppered a golden opportunity when he collapsed the talks with the public sector unions in advance of Christmas, when they, including the representatives of the health workers, were at the negotiating table with definite, imaginative and innovative ideas that would have resulted in reform of the public services?  Where stands all of this now?  Does the Taoiseach not recognise that the consequence of his effective collapsing of the talks before Christmas leaves us with a situation where there is an ever-deepening work to rule with further industrial action in the offing?  Whatever potential there was for serious engagement appears, for now at least, to have been thrown out by the Taoiseach's action at the time.Who are the public service workers?  They are members of all of our families, they are not a bloc of people apart from society at large.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is invidious of elected voices and media commentators to try to create a rift between public service workers and private sector employees?  They come from the same families.  We are talking about public service workers — nurses, teachers, fire-fighters and gardaí — the people who provide local government services such as water services and street maintenance.  They are real people and they are hurting.Is the Taoiseach aware that more than two thirds of public sector workers earn an income of less than €50,000 per year, with more than 40% earning less than €40,000 per year?  They have taken a pay cut on top of pay cut and have demonstrated a willingness in the past to embrace reform but that is not being acknowledged.  They are being continuously demonised and it is time the Government faced up to the reality of the current difficulties representing themselves in the daily work of every Member in this House.What is the Government's strategy?  What is it going to do about the current difficulties with public service workers and their legitimate calls for redress of the very serious cuts that have been imposed on them over recent budgets?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	107	It is a great luxury not to have to worry about budgets while being able to set out rhetorically that the Deputy would defend public services by providing for more public servants, more money and more services while, in the meantime, the taxpayer has to borrow €400 million per week to keep present levels of service going.  We do not have the same room to manoeuvre so we have to work within the budgets available to us and try to get better value for money, effectiveness and efficiency.There is an agenda for transforming public services that was set out not only in the OECD report and the task force that worked from it but also in the work that was done sectorally in discussions directly with the social partners.  They have an intrinsic merit and should be addressed and dealt with on that basis.  It is in everyone's interest in terms of maintaining jobs in the public service that we would have those flexibilities and have that transformation take place.  We must negotiate that and find means by which we can all address it but, in fairness to the social partners, including employee representatives, there is a recognition that all of that work can be done.On the question of being able to provide a solution to the present industrial relations problem, I note what the president of ICTU had to say, that it is both desirable and possible to achieve it.  We must see if there is a realistic basis on which to engage.Yes, there have been pay cuts and they have rightly been progressive with respect to the highest pay cuts being made to those on the highest incomes.  Any sense of fairness would dictate that.  There are also people in the exposed private sector who have lost wages, many of whom unfortunately have lost their jobs.  The security of employment in the public service is a premium that must be recognised by us all and those who are involved in the public service rightfully acknowledge that is something in the present circumstances that is of value and worthwhile.  There are many in the private sector who, unfortunately, because of market conditions have not been in a position to maintain employment levels in comparison to what they were before and others who are currently unemployed.Although there have been political efforts to suggest the contrary, at no stage have I denigrated public servants.  On the contrary, I recognise that in health, education, the Defence Forces, the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Civil Service, and a range of other areas, there are civil and public servants who are seeking to make a contribution to the economic renewal of the country and for the country to come through the present difficulties.  I have never suggested otherwise.The responsibility of Government is to discharge its duties based on the budgetary realities and the fact that we have a configuration in our spending as it is means that every public expenditure programme must make a contribution.  Yes, there was a Government decision on cuts to wages on the basis that we felt to ask the non-pay side of expenditure programmes to take the necessary hit would have greatly affected the provision of services to those who most require them.  We can all have a political debate about whether these are right and correct decisions and people can make up their own minds but the realities do not change.  If there were not to be control of the public and pensions pay bill, we would have had to have hit the services side.  That is something the Government was not prepared to contemplate in present circumstances and, therefore, that balance had to be provided.My answer to the Deputy is that there is a strategy in place.  We must find a realistic basis for engaging on this issue.  We are not starting from a blank page, a lot of work has been done.  It has an intrinsic merit anyway.  It must be proceeded with and I do not believe industrial relations disputes will achieve the objectives set out.  They will weaken rather than strengthen our ability to provide public services in the future given the precarious budgetary situation we have.  All of us must look to the wider issues and common good.  We are all members of the community and must all work within the budgets so we can build for the country again and ensure we can remunerate public servants in the future on a sustainable basis based on growth returning to the economy and getting through the present financial crisis.

We do not know what that strategy is, however, because the Taoiseach has not shared it with us.  Everything he has done runs totally contrary to the notion he has a strategy in place.  The exercise of governance of the public services has had a direct effect on services.  The Taoiseach claims he tried to avoid a curtailment of services but there has been absolute curtailments of services and that continues apace across all Departments.The Taoiseach is right that it is a collective Government responsibility as it affects almost all Departments.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about the notice served for 7 April by 4,500 low paid workers in the hospital network in the capital city?  As of that date, they have served notice of intent to intensify their industrial action.  Talking about it is not good enough.  What is the Taoiseach prepared to do to initiate meaningful engagement with SIPTU to ensure we will not face a calamitous situation across all the hospital sites in this city?  The first responsibility of the Government is to ensure that the situation does not arise but the only way that can be done is by engaging in a serious and concerted effort to meet the needs of those workers and their colleagues who are represented across the public service.

The Deputy cannot have it every way.  He cannot tell us to maintain services and avoid reductions in pay while continuing with a budgetary strategy in respect of which he claims to accept that €4 billion has to be saved.  If he wants to save €4 billion, he should save it but he has to find the money.  If it his view that €2 billion should be raised through taxes, he should explain to the people why he thinks the unemployment level should be higher than is the case at present.  Does he not think it is already too high?We have to work within a budgetary framework which has a deficit of the order of 11%.  That is not a sustainable level and it has to be reduced in the coming years.  The luxury of the Deputy's position is that he can stand up and say all these things to his constituency groups and people will say he is great.  However, he does not have the responsibility for making it all add up.

No responsible Government in our position would do that.However, I am interested in finding a realistic basis on which to engage because I do not believe industrial action will achieve the objectives set out for it.  The situation facing the country requires us to sit down on a realistic basis and with a recognition of what needs to be done.  An entire agenda has already been discussed which has intrinsic merit and should not be conditional on anything because it is the best means by which we can address the concerns of public servants regarding their future pay and security of employment.  It is by looking at the non-pay side that one avoids having to consider the pay side.  The Government has no wish to consider the pay side but the realities are as they are.  Two plus two equals four and one can add the zeroes later.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of local and national importance, namely, the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to pay REPS 4 grants to more than 30% of applicants who were promised payment before Christmas or immediately afterwards.  Many of these farming families are under extreme pressure, partly due to a 33% fall in their incomes and the failure of the Government to deal with the banking crisis.  It is vital this crisis for farming families is debated urgently.

This action is necessary to send Israel a clear message that its occupation is unpardonable, its blockade deplorable and its abuse of third party nationals, including through the theft of passports, intolerable.  While I welcome the stance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Palestine, I ask the Taoiseach to support him against the insults made by EU spokesperson, Baroness Ashton, when he made his report to the EU.

When will the Minister for Health and Children present before this Chamber, or a Minister of State in her Department in her absence, and take the opportunity to address this issue substantively in this House?  There are many serious questions to be addressed.  Contradictory information has been provided in various commentaries regarding this scandalous situation in terms of awareness, knowledge of and action regarding same and that must be addressed in the House.  We need to know with certainty that what has been exposed in respect of Tallaght hospital, where a consultant radiologist did not have or did not avail of the opportunity to scrutinise some 57,000 X-rays, does not pertain at other hospital sites throughout the jurisdiction as well.  This is a very important matter and I call on the Taoiseach to clarify at this point when the Minister, or a Minister of State on her behalf, will present in the Chamber, preferably today.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	148	It is a matter for the procedures of the House as to how that matter can be taken forward.

It is well within his gift, given the importance and seriousness of the matter, to intervene to accommodate an opportunity for it.  I do not know when the Minister is due to return to Ireland.  I realise she is currently out of the country but that should not prevent the House addressing this matter from an informed and definitely focused basis.  Will the Taoiseach ensure at least, in the absence of the Minister, that a Minister of State from her Department would come before the House with the full information and take questions of members of the Opposition?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The questions we have relate to the late sitting and the Finance Bill.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I wish to address the issue raised by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.  It was clear this morning when the Minister spoke from New Zealand that she is muddled and mixed up.  This is a Minister who does not know the difference between meddling and management.  She should come home immediately.An Ceann Comhairle: We are talking about getting the Order of Business for today agreed to.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	154	There are approximately 20,000 people around the Tallaght area waiting to know if their X-rays were read properly.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The Taoiseach needs to address this.  He is the leader of the country.  This morning, he stated he has absolute confidence in the Minister.  He must be one of the few left who does.  In my view, this Minister should resign.An Ceann Comhairle: We must get the Order of Business agreed to.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	157	This is one scandal too many.  I refer to relevant legislation.  Where is the whistleblowers legislation?

As I understand it, the Ceann Comhairle is on notice of any private notice questions that may have been submitted.  The Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill are to be completed today.  That is a very important matter that must be dealt with as well.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The first question has been agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 18 agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The Taoiseach may state continuously that this is a matter to be sorted out by the Whips but the Government orders the business here.  Some 65 amendments to the Finance Bill remain; four have been dealt with.  These range from issues related to NAMA, to the consolidation of taxes, head shops and a whole range of other issues.  The time allocated for today will not allow Members to get into any constructive or detailed discussion about a number of these very important amendments.  There is no reason that the Dáil could not sit for a longer period tomorrow to deal with the details of the amendments to the Finance Bill tabled by Deputies.  I object to the Bill being guillotined today.  It is not good enough.I take the point made by Deputy Reilly in respect of the catastrophe that has befallen certain people and the concern that exists for those whose X-rays have not been read.  They have not been informed about whether they are at a high risk.  This is unsatisfactory and I object to it.  I will vote against the Order of Business unless the Government Whip indicates to me that extra time will be given to these amendments to the Finance Bill tomorrow.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	172	There is a perfectly agreeable way of addressing this issue.  The Finance Bill is probably one of the most important tranches of legislation that comes before the House each year.  Attempting to guillotine the Bill is an insult to the work of the House.  We could find two hours tomorrow easily without seriously discommoding anyone.  As has been done on several occasions in recent times, question time could be pushed back until later in the afternoon tomorrow and we could hold a sufficiency of debate.  Several serious matters arise here and we must hold a discussion with the Minister for Finance on what he proposes.  Happily, he accepted a Labour Party amendment to the Finance Bill last night in respect of an evaluation of the cost of tax expenditures and tax breaks.  That was helpful and it may indicate a new spirit of bipartisanship in this House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	173	We really cannot get into a Second Stage contribution on the Finance Bill at this point.  We are on the Order of Business.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Given that spirit of bipartisanship, it is important to allow sufficient time and respect for the House rather than simply having a guillotine and a jack boot approach to finishing off the legislation in the manner proposed.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Sinn Féin Deputies reject absolutely the proposition that a guillotine should be applied to the Finance Bill at any stage, let alone on Report and Final Stages.  The situation is that only four amendments from approximately 70 tabled were addressed in yesterday's discussions in the Chamber.  There is inadequate time to address the import of all the amendments tabled.  I recognise that this Bill accommodates the removal of the VAT exemption from local authorities that will result in a 13.5% increase in respect of charges covering a whole raft of services at that level.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	176	The Deputy is really into a Second Stage contribution on the Finance Bill.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	178	We require a decision on this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Will the Taoiseach consider again the statement made by the Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, that the lost at sea scheme began as maladministration and ended up as bad governance?  The Ombudsman, appointed by the Government, has said it is not tolerable that the objective and independent report she produced will not be allowed to be discussed at the appropriate Oireachtas committee.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	188	——that they should have the opportunity to answer questions at the relevant committee.  All I want from the Taoiseach is that he has no objection to a committee dealing with this.  The other day when answering a parliamentary question, the Minister for Transport said the Government will not give any more time in the Chamber to this report.  That was a clear statement from the Minister.  I want an equally clear statement from the Taoiseach saying that on account of what the Ombudsman has said officially in public that the appropriate Oireachtas committee, comprising Members from all parties, should be entitled to consider her report on the Lost at Sea scheme.  Deputy Fahey, who is present in the Chamber, has been mentioned in the report.  He should be entitled to give his say in detail at the committee.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	If Deputy Kenny wants a more detailed debate on this matter, he can utilise Private Members' time to do so.

It is clearly a case of where, on the one hand, the Government considered the Ombudsman's report and, on the other, that one of its Members was mentioned in it.  The Government has come down in favour of a Government Deputy.

It is also unusual for the Ombudsman to refer the matter to the Oireachtas for it to decide upon.  The arrangement made for statements on it did not satisfy that requirement.  The Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Sherlock, has tabled a motion to have the issue referred to the appropriate Dáil committee.  That is the only way to deal with this.  The longer this matter continues, the more politicised and more partisan it will become.

The Department rejected the recommendation.  There is a precedent for dealing with this matter, as there was a previous occasion where something similar arose and it was dealt with by the appropriate Oireachtas committee.

We must treat seriously matters she refers to the Dáil and Seanad as she has done in this instance.  It is only the second time a report of the Ombudsman's office has been rejected by a Department.  It is very important that we do not find ourselves in the situation she described in her remarks yesterday, with the Dáil having been sidelined and the Opposition failing to hold the Executive to account.

I am asking the Taoiseach to take this issue seriously immediately.  There can be no question but that the Government has blocked address of this issue in this Chamber, in the Seanad and in the committee.  It is beyond the understanding of any reasonable opinion and should be addressed immediately.  What else will put the matter to bed?  What else will address the concerns expressed by the Ombudsman?  There can be no other way of dealing with this and I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to accede to the collective request of the Opposition to have this matter addressed as a substantive issue by the committee.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Ceann Comhairle repeatedly requests the Opposition to have the matter dealt with in Private Members' time.  That is not the appropriate way to deal with it because we need a forensic investigation and interviews with various parties, including Deputy Fahey whom the Taoiseach is intent on protecting and around whom he is circling the Government wagons.  We are offering Deputy Fahey, the Ombudsman and the complainant an opportunity to come before the committee.  That is what true and effective parliamentary democracy is about, not a charade and a whitewash, which is what the Ceann Comhairle is asking the Opposition to participate in.

I believe we hold the Government to account in the Oireachtas but we are being put in a straitjacket in terms of what we can raise on the Order of Business.  We should be able to raise whether a report should be debated on the Order of Business.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	281	With all due respect, I indicated on this issue.  There is a motion before the House and all the Labour Party wants is to provide the Ombudsman with an opportunity to present the findings of her report before a designated committee, preferably the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  That is on the Order Paper and we are asking that there be some degree of common sense in terms of how this is approached.  We do not want further statements in the Dáil on this matter and, as Deputy Gilmore said, it can be done without debate if we facilitate the person in question.  That is all we are asking.

The Ceann Comhairle finds himself in a difficult position and I am not being critical of him.  The Ceann Comhairle says there are ways and means of dealing with this issue without any change to protocol.  It is a fact of life.  Does the Opposition have to bring the business of the House to a halt in order to get the Government to accept the principle of accountability to Parliament?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	295	A number of misrepresentations have been made by the Opposition and I want to clear up the factual situation.  The Ombudsman Act is entirely silent on how the Houses of the Oireachtas should deal with a special report laid before each House.  The Ombudsman presented a special report to each House of the Oireachtas at which time she invited them to consider the report and "take whatever action they deem appropriate".  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to order its business.  The Dáil and Seanad have dealt with the Ombudsman's report by way of statements on 4 February and 18 February respectively.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	It is a whitewash.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I just heard from Deputy Gilmore about the need to avoid partisanship in respect of this matter.  He wanted to have this matter dealt with by the committee to avoid all partisanship.  Deputy Creed has been involved in a game of partisanship for months.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	301	That is not true.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Every time I get to speak on this, Deputy Creed keeps interrupting me.  I read his statement yesterday.  He has a statement on this every day.  Again, it is Deputy Creed seeking to introduce a degree of partisanship into this matter.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The Taoiseach's party voted it down.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	304	What is the story here?  Does everyone have a right to keep talking while I am talking even though I listened in silence while they were speaking?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	306	If Deputy Creed did not interrupt me, I would have answered by now if Deputy Timmins is interested in an answer but he is not interested in an answer.There is no prescribed issue in respect of the Ombudsman Act that the House dealt with.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	307	There is precedent.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	It is a matter for the Houses of Oireachtas.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Deputy Creed, the Taoiseach should be allowed to speak without interruption.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	310	As the Ombudsman accepts, any Department is free in law to decide whether it will accept the recommendation.  In many cases they are accepted but there have been occasions on which they had not been accepted.  It is out of respect for the Ombudsman's office that we do not reject every recommendation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Just the ones the Government does not like.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, outlined the Government's position in respect of this matter in the House.  I do not accept some of the suggestions made about this.  The Department's reason for taking that position is on the record of the House.  It is entitled in law to take that position.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Where is the opportunity for the House to take a position on this?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I am sorry Deputy——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Deputy Bruton, please.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Ombudsman Act is silent on how that can be dealt with.  We dealt with it by way of statements in the House.  It has been dealt with as far as the Government is concerned.  The Department is entitled in law to take a position and this is accepted by the Ombudsman.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The Parliament is entitled to take a position.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I asked the Taoiseach to address the precedent that exists in this House.  On the one previous occasion in 25 years when the Ombudsman laid a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it was referred to the Oireachtas committee on finance for investigation.  That is all the Houses ask, that the matter be investigated by a committee of the House.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Deputy Creed broke that precedent by bringing the matter into the Dáil.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The recommendations are not legally binding and the Department is entitled in law——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	321	There is precedent.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Members have asked for clarification and I am providing it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Deputy Creed, resume your seat.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The Deputy continues with that——
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Taoiseach is a disgrace.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	326	——as his predecessor continued with it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	As Deputy Killeen stated in his Dáil statement the scheme once decided upon was properly and fairly administered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	328	What about the report?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	329	He also pointed out that the Ombudsman has expressly acknowledged that she found no evidence to suggest that the scheme once launched was not applied equitably.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Has Deputy Creed nothing to say now?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	That is the situation, which does not fit Deputy Creed's little conspiracy theory with which he will keep on anyway.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Let us have a debate then.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	333	White wash.  The Taoiseach is circling the wagons.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I call Deputy Sherlock on a brief question.  We have spent too much time on this matter.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I note what the Taoiseach has said about the Ombudsman's Act being silent on the matter.  Again, we respectfully ask that the Taoiseach allow the Ombudsman an opportunity to present her findings.  I believe that is a reasonable approach.  This can be done in a non-partisan way.  I am sure this House could facilitate such a process.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The Ombudsman is being muzzled.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The Ombudsman has presented her special report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas how it wishes to deal with it.  We have had statements in both Houses on the matter.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	339	Statements are meaningless.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I have explained the situation in terms of what the Department is legally entitled to do, which is accepted by the Ombudsman in any event.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	What does the Taoiseach have to hide?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Deputy Kehoe, please.  We must have one speaker at a time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The report speaks for itself.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	344	If the Taoiseach thinks this issue is going to go away he has another thing coming.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I have just outlined——
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	346	What then does the Taoiseach have to hide?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I have nothing to hide.  That is the reason the report is being dealt with in this manner.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Let it go to committee.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Deputy probably has not even read the report.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	350	What is the Deputy's motivation?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The Taoiseach should let it go to committee if he has nothing to hide.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Deputy Kehoe, please.  We must move on.  I call Deputy Phil Hogan.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The following may not be silent in law.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill is listed on the Order Paper.  We have all read in recent times of the massive splurge of expenditure on travel and entertainment.  There is precedent in this regard.  The Ceann Comhairle's office has been the subject of precedent in respect of this matter.  The director general of FÁS, an agency of the Tánaiste's Department, has been the subject of adjudication on these matters.  When will the Taoiseach bring forth an amendment to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with these matters as per the Bill on the Order Paper?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	354	There is no legislation promised by Government in that respect.  Obviously, there are reports to be considered by the Minister and they will be brought forward in due course.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Does the Taoiseach not regard these matters as serious?

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Taoiseach's Green Party colleagues in government thought the matters relating to the former Ceann Comhairle and Mr. Molloy were serious.  Is the Taoiseach suggesting these issues are not serious enough to be discussed or to warrant a change in the legislation?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	358	If the Deputy tables a parliamentary question——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Perhaps the Government will consider accepting the Fine Gael Bill which seeks to amend the Act to bring forward legislation to allow a proper investigation of these matters.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	360	——it should get to the core of the matter for him.  I call Deputy Broughan.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	361	There has been no comment by me suggesting matters are not serious or otherwise.  I am merely making the point that the report should be considered by the Minister taking the advice he is taking and will be published in due course.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	362	When will they be published?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Will he develop a legal problem too?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	364	That is the situation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I call Deputy Broughan.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I have four brief questions for the Taoiseach.  I understand the competition Bill includes a section to deal with the situation whereby a company can effectively own a large shareholding in its direct competitor, as is happening in aviation.  When will that Bill come before the House?I understand the globalisation fund extra information for the SRT workers was on the desk of Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, last week.  Has that information been sent back to Brussels?  There was massive disruption yesterday by the taxi industry.  The Taoiseach will be aware the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The Deputy must confine his questions to promised legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I understand the taxi workers want to discuss with the Minister the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on taxis.  Perhaps a meeting in this regard could be arranged as soon as possible.Perhaps the Taoiseach will when in Chicago next week visit Northfields to meet the chief executive of Kraft in respect of workers at Cadburys.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Taoiseach, on promised legislation.

On the question in respect of the competition Bill, it is proposed to introduce it by the end of this year.  The information in relation to SRT has been returned to Brussels.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	371	What is the position with the stabilisation fund?

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	377	When will the health information Bill, which should legalise and force these people to tell us the truth once and for all, be introduced?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I am advised it will be introduced in the middle of the year.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	379	When will the landlord and tenants Bill come before the House given the extremely serious situation in particular in Border areas, in respect of rent?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	380	It is not possible at this stage to indicate when that Bill will come before the House.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	381	We are continually advised of the great work being done by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  We are told that big is great and big is perfect.  Members will be aware of the current situation at Tallaght Hospital.  When will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be brought before the House to allow us an opportunity to discuss the complete utter chaos of our health system?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I am advised no date has yet been fixed for that Bill.  I call Deputy Terence Flanagan.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The multi-unit developments Bill is long overdue legislation.  I accept an update on the matters has been received from the Whips' office.  While the multi-unit developments Bill is complex legislation its introduction has been dragging on now for eight years.  Meanwhile there is no redress for the 400,000 apartment owners.  These people have nobody to turn to in respect of disputes and problems that arise.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will expedite this legislation and provide the House with an update in this regard.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Deputy Flanagan is spokesperson on the matter and deserves a proper answer.

Perhaps he will make it his business to ensure the 1,200 jobs at Cadburys in Dublin are retained.  The last thing we need in this country is more people joining the dole queues.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	406	Given the Taoiseach has stated he has confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, perhaps he will tell us the reason the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, did not inform her in June of the situation at Tallaght Hospital.  How is it possible that the word of the CEO that there were only 4,000 cases involved when it transpires that there are 58,000 cases involved, was accepted?  This is the worst scandal yet we have had in this country.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I wish to be of assistance to the Deputy on the matter.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I put it to the Ceann Comhairle that if a whistleblower had not given this story to Mr. Fergal Bowers and he had not broken it, we still would not know about it.

When will the legislation promised in the programme for Government, which the Taoiseach and Minister for Health and Children appear to be putting on the long finger, be brought before this House?  Will the Taoiseach, Minister and HIQA assure this House that this situation does not pertain in other hospitals around the country?

It is simply not credible that when the Minister was told about this in December by the CEO of Tallaght Hospital, she was not told the extent of it.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I have advised the House that we are allowing a special notice question on the matter this afternoon.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	441	You will have the opportunity to make these points at that stage.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	442	This is much broader than the immediate issue.  It is a matter of the Minister's competence.  The Minister handed over complete responsibility for the health service to the HSE, and because of that, she is now hiding behind the fact——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Deputy O'Sullivan, will you resume your seat please?

This report claims that 120,000 jobs can be created.  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to bring the report to the House?  We can then have a full debate on it and hear the Government's detailed response to the recommendations of the report.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	That is a matter for the Whips.

This report will be launched tomorrow by the task force that wrote it and it will be considered by the Government.  It is a matter for the Whips to decide when this or any other report will be debated.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The Taoiseach will be in the arms of President Obama next week.  Will he raise the issue of the undocumented Irish?  It is very important.  Many of our Irish illegals are caught in limbo over there, and I hope the Taoiseach will raise it with the President next week.  We were promised legislation on the issue by the US Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	452	It is a difficult issue on the domestic agenda, but it will be raised.

There is an explicit right in our Constitution to free travel.  That explicit right has been denied to people due to the actions of staff at the passport office.  Will the Taoiseach get the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do something about it?  It is disgraceful that people all over the country are arriving at the office but cannot get their passport.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has his own passport in order for next week, but it is unacceptable that people cannot travel abroad.  We are a laughing stock abroad and the CPSU is running rings around the Government.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	454	It is pure blackguarding where people have had to travel to and from the passport office.  It is outrageous.  We do not have a passport office in rural Ireland.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I dealt with this in Leaders' Questions and in parliamentary questions.  I will refer the Deputy to the note I already sent on the issue.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I asked the staff of the Oireachtas Library to do some research on local authority loans.  They informed me that 43% of such loans across the country were in arrears.  When I asked officials at Kildare County Council what could be done about this, they told me that their hands were tied and they could do nothing about it.  They said that if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government gave a ministerial order under section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, it would allow them to negotiate with people who had loans to ensure that proper facilities were put in place to deal with arrears.The Minister has approved ministerial orders for other sections of that Bill, but I am asking the Taoiseach——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	459	We really have to do this some other way.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I am going to ask the question.  When will the ministerial order for section 34 of the Act take place to allow local authorities deal with people who have taken out local authority loans and who are in arrears?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	461	That is a matter for parliamentary questions, but I will inquire about it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The records of the House clearly show that amendment No. 3 was accepted by the Dáil yesterday.  It was debated for about three quarters of an hour.  It was put before the Dáil and was agreed.  Earlier this morning I welcomed the assent of the Government parties on amendment No. 3 as a sign of bipartisanship in this House.  The amendment merely deals with the report on the costing of tax expenditure——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The Minister has now said there was an error last evening.  The Leas-Ceann Comhairle called the amendment three times and slowly declared that it was being accepted.

However, he told us that it would not be acted on until we had time to discuss it.  Can we at least defer it until later in the day?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The order of the Dáil states that resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 18 shall be taken today, and notwithstanding proceedings yesterday, shall resume on amendment No. 3.

The record of the House clearly shows that amendment No. 3 was passed yesterday.  It was called out by the Leas-Ceann Comhairle no less than three times.  The Leas-Ceann Comhairle then said that amendment No. 3 was agreed.  It was agreed and there was no dissent whatsoever and no comment from the Government side.  When there is no comment and no dissent, that is an agreement.  The record of the House shows that.A Cheann Comhairle, you are here to protect the interests of all Members.  After passing amendment No. 3, we then moved on to the next amendment, which was ruled out of order and we are now coming to amendment No. 5.  Unless you are making up a new rule——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	479	A Cheann Comhairle, under what standing order are you bringing in this procedure?  We are being told that amendments in our name are being disallowed by you because we are trying to introduce new material, but in this case you allow the Government to rescind a formal decision taken by the House without any "by your leave".  I do not think that is fair play.  If the Minister feels that this Bill should not have the amendment that has been made, he can reintroduce a Bill to delete it.  I could understand a new amendment being tabled later in the day which would involve the deletion of this section and there would be an opportunity to consider whether that was right.  I am sure the Minister would have a procedure for that but what is happening now is that the Minister is pretending yesterday's events never happened and that is not fair to the respective sides of the House.  Rules seem to be——

The order states: "(2) the resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 18 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. tonight by one Question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance;".  That is the order that was circulated to the House.  When the Ceann Comhairle announced the order, because there was opposition to the guillotine, I did not hear, and the House did not see, any change to the order presented to us by Government. From where did the other order come or how was it  passed without anybody in the House knowing about it except perhaps the Government Whip?  Why did the Government Whip not stay in the House——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	509	——between yourself and the Government Whip.  Yesterday, the Minister, either by accident or design, but in my view rightly, assented to a simple, cost free amendment on the part of the Labour Party to have a report on the cost of tax expenditures presented within a month of the Finance Bill.  I welcomed the Minister's new spirit of bipartisanship earlier because it makes sense.  The Minister is now saying he is resiling from what he and the Government assented to last night and he failed to comment when the Ceann Comhairle's deputy clearly called the item three times.  The Clerk and the Clerk Assistant are present and I believe they were both present last night also.  Are they suggesting that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not call the matter clearly because he did so?  We then moved on to the next business, and that is where we are now.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	510	On a point of order, I was in the House yesterday afternoon when the amendment was put and accepted.  I was here during that period and I state categorically that is what I believe happened.The Ceann Comhairle might clarify for me whether the Order of Business, as adopted today, is sufficient to over-rule a decision of the House taken yesterday.  If that is the case in regard to this amendment, will it be the case that on every occasion we adopt Standing Orders in the House the Government can rescind a decision of the Dáil the following day by dint of how it is worded?  I support the comments of previous speakers because I, too, had no notice of the Order of Business as the Ceann Comhairle now describes it.  That is unfair.  If an error was made, people should say an error was made and find a fair and reasonable way of dealing with it.

Deputy Burton, who had proposed the amendment, had spoken for the third time and could not speak again.  The Minister had concluded his contribution.  At that point, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Brendan Howlin, arrived to replace me in the chair and immediately put the amendment but the entire debate had been concluded.  There can be no further debate on the issue because the proposer of the amendment had spoken for the third time in her concluding remarks and the Minister had finalised it.  We were at the point of the amendment being put.  We cannot go back to an amendment that had been put to the House and approved.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	516	It states, "Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 not moved".  The business then moved on.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The House has not decided what it will do yet, Deputy, but it will be asked to decide shortly.  The position is that the Government had made a formal proposal through the order which was agreed by the House earlier this morning.  The order stated that we would recommence the debate on amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Burton on Report Stage of the Finance Bill.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Despite amendments Nos. 4 and 5 having been dealt with already.

We cannot return to that amendment.  Having voted we had moved from that amendment to amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  We cannot return to amendment No. 3.  If we are to follow the course that has been suggested it would mean returning to amendments Nos. 4 and 5.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	533	We will resume the debate on amendment No. 3.

When did the Taoiseach say this?  Is the Ceann Comhairle saying he said it because he did not present it to the Whips nor did he discuss it with them?

This is deciding by fiat that a matter debated and dealt with in order by the House no longer stands.  The Taoiseach cannot read out from a bit of a paper and rule out what the Parliament has done.  That would be like throwing out some item of legislation on one order.  That is not democracy.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	550	There is no provision for it.

I have Standing Order 26 to hand.  One would want to have a mind of elastic to try to stretch into that Standing Order the ability to give power to the Government to actually change a decision made yesterday.  There is nothing like that in the Standing Order.  However that Standing Order could be applied to this situation, it is simply ordering the business of the day.  Is the Ceann Comhairle saying the Government can order the business of the day and rescind business of yesterday?  There is nothing in the Standing Orders of this House to allow the Minister to do that.

I objected to the guillotine being applied to the Finance Bill.  I had the written order in front of me and can confirm with our Whip that, in the copy we received, there was no reference to amendment No. 3.  The Ceann Comhairle is suggesting that the Taoiseach, in his presentation to the House, audible only to his colleagues and the Ceann Comhairle, suggested the order for today would be changed without due written notification or discussion by the Whips to rescind a decision the House agreed yesterday quite lawfully and amicably.The Ceann Comhairle has a responsibility to me, as a Member of the House, as much as he has to the Government.  The procedure he is adopting is patently and blatantly unfair.  If he is accepting some muttering from the Taoiseach that none of us heard, although we were all alert, it is unfair.  I welcomed the fact that the Government, after a long discussion, assented, however silently, to amendment No. 3.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle put the amendment to the House three times.

It might be useful to suspend the sitting of the Dáil to allow the Ceann Comhairle to check exactly what happened.  I fully understand and appreciate that he was not in the Chair yesterday when this incident occurred and, therefore, he and his officials may need to check the record.Will the Ceann Comhairle also check whether it is reasonable or fair, under Standing Orders or under what one of his predecessors used to describe to me, by way of preaching, as the long-standing traditions of the House, that the Order of Business of today can overturn a sovereign decision taken in the House yesterday?  What value have I in today's business if it can be overturned completely tomorrow morning on the Order of Business?  If the Ceann Comhairle suspends the House for ten minutes to check this, I will be happy.

The House has been misled by Deputy Burton in one respect, in regard to which I am entitled to put on the record one fact.  That fact is that at no stage during my contribution yesterday did I lend any support to the suggestion that I was supporting the amendment.  The opposite has been stated on several occasions by Deputy Burton.  I acknowledge there was an error in that I did not oppose the amendment and it was agreed.  I immediately raised the matter at 7 p.m. with Deputy Burton and she indicated that she was not prepared to resile from her position, which was her right.  Equally, the Government dealt with the matter this morning on the Order of Business, which is its right, subject to whatever ruling the Chair may make.

There was nobody from Fianna Fáil except the Minister present yesterday while the amendment was being discussed, although we were dealing with the Finance Bill, one of the most important Bills that the House passes every year.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle asked the position on amendment No. 3 no fewer than three times and stated slowly that it was being passed.By not voting, the Government assented to the passage of the amendment, irrespective of the personal and governmental views the Minister may have expressed in the debate.  It has happened, albeit not very often with the Department of Finance or Minister for Finance, that Ministers have assented to what the House has proposed.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	595	The economic downturn from the middle of 2008 meant that the Government has had to take urgent and decisive action to stabilise our public finances.  This has inevitably required a series of reductions across all areas of public expenditure, including capital expenditure.  The NDP, when launched in early 2007, envisaged that Exchequer capital investment would be €76 billion over the period 2007-13 when growth of 4%-4.5% per annum was expected.  It is now envisaged that Exchequer capital investment for the same period will be more than €47 billion, a considerable investment even though economic growth is now far lower.The economic developments since the launch of the NDP have implications for the affordability of investment plans and the demand for infrastructure in the economy.  The capital programme for the future remains substantial.  The 2010 Exchequer capital allocation is €6.43 billion, which is nearly 5% of GNP.  I also announced on the day of the budget a further €5.5 billion Exchequer capital allocation for each year from 2011-16.  The cumulative Exchequer capital investment programme from 2010-16 will amount to more than €39 billion.  Lower construction and tendering prices will also allow us to get greater outputs, even within nominally reduced levels of investment.This is a significant investment programme which will build on the high level of public sector investment which has taken place in the past decade.  Government capital investment will continue to support those projects which will help economic recovery, the development of a productive and internationally competitive economy, the development of the smart green economy, support sustainable long-term employment and provide modern social infrastructure.The PPP model of procurement will also play an important role in delivering investment in Ireland's economic and social infrastructure.  The Exchequer programme outlined above will be supplemented by a substantial pipeline of PPP projects.  The PPP programme is projected to deliver in excess of €5.5 billion in private capital investment across the transport, education and wider social infrastructure sectors in the medium term.  I am confident this well-targeted investment will help support jobs in the construction sector, will provide us with the requisite economic and social infrastructure and make a substantial contribution to our economic recovery.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I thank the Minister for his reply.  If the Minister proceeds with a cut in spending of €1 billion next year, over the years 2009-11 he will have taken almost €9 billion out of capital spending.  It will reduce spending by almost one third compared to what was projected in the capital budget.  We know from the ERSI that the impact of that would be the equivalent of 90,000 jobs in the construction sector.  When everyone in the country is saving to try to reduce their excessive debts, is it not a mistake for the State to slash its investment programme?  Should we be using this opportunity to invest in assets with sound returns?  I do not want to market Fine Gael's new era project.  Does the Minister agree that vital arteries, such as the electricity and broadband systems, need to be brought up to 21st century standards?  How can we have a strategy for economic recovery which is solely built on retrenchment in capital budgets when we need investment to begin?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Almost 5% of GDP is quite a high level of capital investment compared to many other member states in the eurozone.  That said, it is justifiably high given our infrastructural needs.  The Government's commitment to peg the figure at a definite sum for the next five years is welcome and ensures there is stability and certainty about the continuance of that level of public investment.Deputy Bruton referred to other forms of investment apart from the public capital programme, such as the investments which can be made through devices such as investments made by the ESB or Bord Gáis in different projects, something which those commercial enterprises are free to do.  As Deputy Bruton is aware, the dividends which the State might have obtained from these bodies in recent years have been foregone in order that enterprises have cheaper energy prices.  That is a vital economic need in the current stressed economic conditions.The Deputy referred to his party's document on these matters — I do not want to be contentious about it so I will not discuss it today — but the figures do not allow for the fact that it is necessary at this point in time to give support to energy companies and energy prices for business.  That is what the Government is doing.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	598	In the past 18 months, some 200,000 people have become unemployed, more than 80% of whom are under the age of 30.  Are we at risk of pursuing a very limited policy of retrenchment when we need a combination of investment, reform and restructuring?  The Minister's narrow track risks a correction in the economy which will be ground out by mass unemployment rather than examining where we can create opportunities to invest at a time when, to use the phrase "The paradox of thrift", everyone is saving furiously.  The economy will continue to sink into a vicious cycle.  The State has to take a leadership role.  If the Minister does not like Fine Gael's new era document, I submit to him that he needs to develop another strong investment vehicle which can drive forward the economy instead of grinding it down.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	599	On a stimulus package, every country in the world has been faced with similar problems to ours and all have had recourse to some form of stimulus through the injection of moneys by central banks in the countries concerned.  We have seen this in the United Kingdom and in the United States.  Ireland is in a free trade area and we have provided a substantial stimulus.  Members of the House must recognise that the extent of the borrowing in which we are currently engaged is a substantial stimulus to the economy.  It is at a percentage which cannot be trespassed, as far as any Irish Government is concerned.  It provides a substantial stimulus to the economy.  If we did not have that element of borrowing in the equation, far greater retrenchment would be required.  A balance must be struck in these matters.I agree with the Deputy on the wider question he raised.  The Government has to move on from the stabilisation it has effected in the economy.  The Government now has to move on to the essential measures which will support economic growth and recovery in the months and years ahead.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	600	As I stated in my Second Stage speech on the NAMA Bill on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital.  I made clear in the speech, to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, that the Government remains committed to providing such banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements in a manner consistent with EU state aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy.In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, based on the information provided by me in mid-September to this House, the scale of its NAMA-eligible loans are such that they will give rise to a further capital requirement for the State.  I am currently assessing the scale of any further capital support for Anglo Irish Bank in light of the emerging accounting and end of year financial position of the bank, and the likely impact of the NAMA transfers over the course of 2010.In general terms, the impact of any future bank recapitalisation on the Exchequer, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the general Government balance will depend on the scale and source of the recapitalisation funds and the basis on which the capital is provided and, therefore, cannot be specified at this point.  The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2009 was funded by Exchequer borrowing in 2009.  Following consultation with EUROSTAT, the injection was classified as a financial transaction and, therefore, did not affect the general Government balance.  As a general rule of thumb, each €1 billion extra borrowed is estimated to cost the Exchequer about €50 million per year in interest costs.The recapitalisations of both AIB and Bank of Ireland were made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund from its existing assets and, as such, had no impact on Exchequer borrowing requirements.  As these injections were also classified as financial transactions, there was no impact upon the general Government balance, and the National Pensions Reserve Fund used its existing assets to make the injection.  As the nature of any future recapitalisation is as yet unknown, it is not yet possible to assess exactly the effect on the Exchequer balance and the general Government balance.  I can assure the Deputy that the regulator is in constant discussion with the National Treasury Management Agency about these matters.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is now two and a half months since the Anglo Irish Bank year end.  It is a State-owned bank.  Speculation has appeared in the newspapers, uncontested by the Department of Finance, that the losses at Anglo Irish Bank are likely to be in the region of €10 billion to €12 billion, and I have seen mention of €14 billion.  Is the Minister aware the bank is expecting to post very significant losses in the order of €10 billion and upwards when its year-end accounts are published?  Does the Minister know when they will be published?Second, as a consequence, does the Minister intend to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank and to do so in stages?  Again, there has been frequent comment in the media that an initial recapitalisation of €6 billion may be required but this may be insufficient and there may be further recapitalisation.Does the Minister understand how upset many ordinary people are at the notion that the State will absorb perhaps €12 billion of losses in Anglo Irish Bank and, furthermore, that the State will then be required to pump a further €6 billion and upwards, either in a single interval or in stages, into the bank?  Does the Minister have a position on the adequacy of the capital ratio given that the Financial Regulator is indicating a minimum of 8%?

I am currently assessing the scale of any further capital support for Anglo Irish Bank in light of the emerging accounting end-year financial position of the bank and the likely impact of the NAMA transfers over the course of 2010.Anglo Irish Bank is currently preparing its accounts for the 15-month period to 31 March 2010.  These accounts have not been finalised and it would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to comment on those——

These accounts have not been finalised and it would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on these in view of the commercial sensitivities involved.  That is the official position in regard to the accounts at Anglo Irish Bank.  The accounting period will end on 31 March of this year, making it a 15-month accounting period.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	605	While I do not want to take issue with the Minister, and he may wish to correct his papers, my understanding was that Anglo Irish Bank's year end was September.  The Minister will recall the guarantee was issued on the night before Anglo Irish Bank's year end of 30 September.  The 15-month accounting period goes from September 2008 to December 2009.  The Minister might check his papers later, although it is a minor point.

We understand that the accounts to 31 December are in preparation at present and should be ready for issuance very soon.I understood from recent statements by the Taoiseach that he is anticipating the Government will make a major announcement on recapitalisation of the banks after the St. Patrick's Day travels and the Cabinet reshuffle.  I understand the recapitalisation statement may come sometime around the end of March or the beginning of April.  Is a broad framework date set for the recapitalisation?  If the required minimum capital level being indicated is 8%, although many observers talk about 10% capital levels and above, does the Minister know when the European Commission will publish its decision on the viability of Anglo Irish Bank and its business plan?  Does the Minister believe Anglo Irish Bank has a future as a business bank or as an SME?  At present, it is a zombie bank which is not doing any lending.  It seems the level of the State investment required is extraordinary for no outcome.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The Deputy asks a number of very pertinent questions.  On the question of an announcement about the capitalisation, as I indicated already to the House, the first round of the NAMA valuations is approaching completion.  At that stage, once the first round of NAMA valuations is announced, there will then be an actual estimated position in regard to each institution.  Deputies will recall that last September I gave an estimated figure of the potential NAMA liability or cost of acquiring the assets.  That was, of course, an estimate, as I have pointed out on many occasions, and was subject to the necessary bottom-up valuations required in the legislation.  The first round of those bottom-up valuations will be ready at a later stage this month.  At that stage, the position will be far more institutionally specific than it was in the context of the announcement in February 2009, when there was an industry-wide announcement.  It will be necessary to consider capital questions in regard to all institutions at that stage.  In regard to capital, the regulator has a vital role in prescribing what the appropriate level of regulatory capital is for each institution.Deputy Burton asked wider questions about Anglo Irish Bank.  Its structural plan is with the European Commission.  By virtue of restrictions that are already in operation at European level, there is a considerable amount of restriction on the amount of lending which the bank can do as a State-aided bank.  Those structural discussions are still taking place with the European authorities.It is important to bear in mind in regard to Anglo Irish Bank that it was essential and in the interests of the national economy that this bank be stabilised.  The impact of the NAMA legislation will be a substantial downsizing in the loan book of Anglo Irish Bank and, at that stage, we will be in a position to take a view on its future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Deputy O'Donnell will be aware that under the NAMA legislation I will issue guidelines to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA-participating banks.  I hope banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to join the system.  My aim is to have a simple, effective review process, run by persons with experience and credibility.  The banks must comply with the recommendations of the review process, or explain their reason for not doing so.In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs.  This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit.  I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.Work has been ongoing since December on the logistical aspects of the review system and it is envisaged that reviews will commence shortly.  While it is preferable that the banks raise capital themselves, without State involvement, I am on record as saying that if further capital injections from the State into the banking sector are required, the Government is willing to act.  In the case of AIB or Bank of Ireland these capital injections would be in the form of equity capital, which would have the effect of increasing State ownership and control.I ask the Deputy to recall that the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland imposed a range of requirements on the two banks, including important commitments to support business lending.  As part of the recapitalisation package announced in February 2009, both AIB and Bank of Ireland confirmed their commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending was not taken up, then the extra capacity would be made available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment is monitored by the Financial Regulator and quarterly reports are submitted by both banks.

It appears NAMA will provide orders for a mechanism for appeals regarding loans or overdrafts not granted.  Will the Minister specify to the banks the level of credit they must provide?  Will the Minister confirm that all the development and property loans of the institutions will be taken over by NAMA?  I refer to the recently published accounts from AIB.  A total of €23 billion of development loans will be taken over by NAMA but there remains €27 billion of property and construction sector loans on the AIB balance sheet.  Will the Minister confirm this point?  If property and construction sector loans remain on the books of the banks such loans will further deteriorate and the banks will not be freed up.Will the Minister comment on the announcements by the banks that interest rates will be raised for the mortgage and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors?  NAMA will provide liquidity to the banks but that might be accompanied by lower deposit interest rates because they may not need to access deposits.  There appears to be nothing in what the Minister is providing.  Will he consider putting in place a bank guarantee scheme to ensure that credit flows to small business, along the lines of the national recovery bank?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The Deputy has asked many questions.  With regard to the nature of the regulations, the Deputy's subsequent questions are more interesting, if I may say so, because I will be repeating myself.  I indicated to Deputy Burton that there are two elements to the regulations, one deals with the actual appeal mechanism and side by side with that is a sectoral analysis of each bank's performance.  We cannot rest easy on the idea of an appeal mechanism where lenders may believe they are discouraged from making an example of their financial institution.  We have to continue with detailed sectoral analysis of the position in each bank as it affects different sectors of industry and so that I can take further measures, if such measures are required.The Deputy will recall that I made that point to him on Committee Stage, that it was important we did not just have one shot at this subject but rather two and three shots if required.On the second point regarding loan guarantee schemes, there is an examination under way of the proposal to introduce a loan guarantee scheme at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Any scheme developed has to assist business while at the same time assisting the interests of the taxpayer.  One cannot introduce a loan guarantee scheme which in effect permits financial institutions to dump bad loans on the taxpayer.On the wider proposal referred to by the Deputy, the national recovery bank, I have been quango-shooting this bank since last October and there is constant reference to this French comparison.  What France has in existence is no different from what we already have in existence.  The French equivalent of the National Treasury Management Agency raises funds directly for the French banking system.  Were we to copy that system in this jurisdiction, it would have to be done on a non-discriminatory basis and not just for a particular financial institution one's party might wish to establish.  The NTMA would then have to raise the funds for the entire banking system.

#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	616	How will NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks ensure that credit will flow to small and medium-sized enterprises?  They are currently on their knees.  The Minister appears to be making up policy on the hoof.  A total of 55% of small and medium-sized enterprises have been unable to access credit in the past three months.The Minister referred to the taxpayer.  The Minister could put a total of €25 billion into the banks but credit might not flow as a result.  How will he ensure that credit will flow?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	617	If we do not set up an assets relief agency, which is an established feature of the banking rescue landscape in virtually every country in the world, we will not be in a position to provide credit.  The whole purpose of NAMA, as I have pointed out many times, is to accelerate bank losses so that we can ensure that the banks are in a position to lend——

That has been the experience of the past 18 months.  The Deputy referred to interest rates and interest rate difficulties——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Interest rates reflect the cost of money.  If the position is that deposit rates are high in Ireland, correspondingly, interest rates will be high in Ireland because banks have to pay interest on foot of the deposit.  We need to have a real discussion about the banking problems here and let us move away from the sloganising that has unfortunately taken the place of real debate in many cases.

It means other Deputies are squeezed out.  The Deputy might want to prioritise but I have to be fair to all Deputies.  I call Deputy Joan Burton.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I will get a chance on this one, anyway.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	631	As the Deputy will be aware, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 will expire on 29 September 2010.  This scheme was introduced following the collapse of Lehmann Brothers and the following liquidity crisis of September 2008.  However, the funding of Irish banks has improved dramatically in the intervening period and the blanket guarantee will no longer be necessary into the future.  A key feature of the new scheme introduced in December 2009 is access to longer-term funding, which is in line with the mainstream approach in the EU and is expected to contribute significantly to supporting the sustainable funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability.  The structure of the scheme allows participating institutions to issue guaranteed and unguaranteed liabilities, which will help reduce their reliance on State guarantee support over time as financial market conditions continue to improve.AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS, Irish Life & Permanent and the Irish Nationwide Building Society and named subsidiaries, are the participating institutions in the ELG scheme.  Deposits covered by the ELG scheme at the end of February stood at €108 billion, while debt covered by ELG was €37 billion.  The NTMA provides a comprehensive list on its website of securities which are guaranteed under ELG.With regard to dated subordinated debt, this is not a covered liability under the ELG scheme.  The EU Commission's banking communication of 13 October 2008 states that guarantees should not include subordinated debt.  The new scheme reflects that policy under EU state-aid rules.  In addition the funding positions of the covered institutions have improved significantly since the original guarantee and there is no need to have these liabilities covered.  It must be stressed, however, that these dated liabilities will remain covered under the CIFS scheme until the expiry of that scheme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Can the Minister confirm that senior debt issued by the covered institutions before the commencement date of the new extended liabilities guarantee scheme, 9 December, will continue to be guaranteed on 29 September, the anniversary of the guarantee, when it is meant to expire, but will then cease to be guaranteed under either guarantee scheme?  Alternatively, is it the Minister's intention to exercise his prerogative under the primary bank guarantee legislation to extend beyond 29 September the guarantee for the senior debt issued by the covered institutions before the commencement date of the new ELG scheme?What level of senior debt issued by the covered institutions before the commencement date will mature on or before 29 September?  Will this debt be refinanced under the ELG scheme?  To what extent are institutions engaging in maturity swapping under the full guarantee to the ELG, rolling over the guarantee in tranches?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	633	In the absence of the ELG, many of the banks found it difficult to finance themselves beyond 30 September.  An amount of senior debt would lapse on that date anyway.  It is precisely to avoid that danger arising for the banks that the ELG legislation provided for the option of the bank refinancing beyond that date under guarantee so senior debt could be rolled out in an orderly manner for the institutions.  There were some figures in the reply but they were not comprehensive.  If the Deputy wishes for further information, it can be provided to her for the amounts involved.On the separate question of other guaranteed securities arising in addition to the ELG, I made it clear in my answer that there is no question of any dated subordinated debt being extended under any circumstances.  It would, however, be a brave man who would predict what would happen in the banking landscape in the next six months in Europe.  Clearly any such change would require European approval and the ELG is what we have agreed with Brussels.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Do I hear a note of doubt entering the Minister's voice?  Is he not closing off the possibility that the guarantee will, perhaps in piecemeal fashion, be extended after 29 September?  The Minister appeared to confirm that all dated subordinated debt, the really risky stuff that we do not know why Fianna Fáil included it in the guarantee, is definitely out after 29 September.  I hear doubt in the Minister's voice that would indicate he is thinking of extending the guarantee for the senior debt, even where it might not be part of the eligible liabilities scheme.  In a way that scheme was the Minister's device to allow for the swapping of the senior debt into a new form of more limited, time structured guarantee.  Is he thinking in that way?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	635	No.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	637	The Deputy was wrong to detect a note of doubt.  Subordinated debt is out.  Fianna Fáil did not introduce it, the Government and this House did and the Government did on it advice from the Central Bank, the regulator and the other authorities.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Fianna Fáil is the senior Government party so I see more of the Minister than I do of our absent Green Party friends.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	639	What has been put in place for senior debt is our envisaged response to the issue and there is no room for any doubt about that.  Where I expressed a doubt related to wider European developments; what has been done on senior debt has been agreed with the Commission.  That is our position.  The issue I raised was if developments through the European area might dictate a change.  I could not predict that.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	640	As the Deputy will be aware a detailed and comprehensive legal and regulatory framework is in place in Ireland for the regulation and supervision of the financial services sector.  This framework is underpinned by an extensive series of EU directives governing the conduct of financial services activities on a cross-border basis within the EU Single Market.Clearly, an effective system of enforcement is central to the effectiveness of any system of financial supervision.  Under the statutory framework which established the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the Financial Regulator was conferred with significant powers to impose sanctions for prescribed contraventions of legislation or regulatory rules.The Financial Regulator has wide-ranging powers to conduct an examination where it suspects that a regulated financial service provider and/or person concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider has committed a "prescribed contravention".  If the examination  concludes that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there is or has been a prescribed contravention, the Financial Regulator can establish a inquiry.   The inquiry shall decide if the prescribed contravention has occurred and determine the appropriate sanctions.The legislation provides that, at any time up to the conclusion of an inquiry, the Financial Regulator may enter into a binding settlement agreement with a regulated financial service provider and/or a person concerned in its management to resolve the matter.  Where a financial services firm or individual enters into such an agreement early in the pursuit of a sanctions case, the terms of the settlement will reflect the savings in time, resources and money that would result.  Administrative sanctions procedure decisions can be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.My Department has been advised that the Financial Regulator has concluded 26 enforcement actions since it received the legislative powers to do so.  Seven people have been disqualified from being involved in the management of regulated financial services providers for various periods of time and one person stepped down as a director.  Seven of the firms sought the voluntary revocations of their authorisations.In addition to the powers available to the Financial Regulator under the administrative sanctions regime, specific criminal offences are provided for under various national and EU legal instruments where a breach of regulatory requirements might arise.  For instance, certain offences under the markets in financial instruments directive are punishable in Ireland by up fines up to €10 million and/or up to ten years imprisonment.  The same punishments also apply in the case of other EU legislation.Clearly, in restoring the reputation of the regulatory system through the reform of our regulatory structures, it will be a priority for the Government to ensure that any measures required to strengthen the powers of enforcement available to the new Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that a credible and robust enforcement regime is in place for the future.  In that regard, my Department is in discussions with the Financial Regulator, now headed by Mr. Matthew Elderfield, and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, to which Dr. Patrick Honohan has recently been appointed as Governor, to assess possible areas of improvement to its enforcement powers and supervisory resources with a view to including appropriate provisions in forthcoming legislation on the restructuring of the Central Bank.There will be three Bills by the end of the year related to the reform of the Central Bank.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	641	Does the Minister share the dismay of the public that, 18 months into the financial crisis, no one has been held to account?  In the US there are 42 bankers in jail and the banks are paying money back to the state for the assistance they got.   Are inquiries or sanctions being pursued against the financial institutions that are at the core of the failure?  Does a vagueness in the definition of the offences prevent the criminal or civil arms of enforcement from taking action?  It certainly appears to the public that serious misdemeanours took place.Are changes being introduced in respect of boards of directors which failed their shareholders so that board members have suitable qualifications, know their business and act effectively?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	642	The Deputy has gone beyond the remit of the question but I am happy to deal with the additional matters raised.  In regard to boards of directors, there has been substantial change in personnel and this process will continue.  The entire board of Anglo Irish Bank changed when the bank was nationalised, with one exception who had been appointed a few weeks earlier.  We have also seen substantial change in the other institutions in respect of chairs and chief executive officers.  As part of recapitalisation, we have insisted on a rotation scheme in both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank.The investigations into particular matters, which are warranted by what has been established, have moved beyond the regulatory stage and I understand they are now at a criminal stage of investigation.  This investigation has to take priority over the regulator and is being conducted on a parallel basis by the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The fraud squad has been involved for the past 12 months and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement stated at least ten months ago that prima facia evidence existed of a criminal offence ten months ago but nothing has happened.  We have not even seen the legal changes that would clarify the offences and the type of probity and fitness required to serve on a board.  Nothing has happened that would give the public new confidence.  We have seen neither tough enforcement nor new standards.  For the sake of public confidence, these measures have to be implemented.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The first element of public confidence was established by the appointment of the new regulator, who has certainly inspired confidence in all his actions to date.  As I indicated to the House yesterday, I intend to ensure any legislation introduced enhances his independence and freedom of action and ensures that a credible statement is made both at home and abroad about the proper regulation of our banking system.We will have to deal with three items of legislation pertaining to the Central Bank and while I accept the third will be a consolidation measure——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The Minister's colleagues told us months ago that charges were imminent.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Responsibility for these matters rests not with the Government but with the bodies entrusted with instituting charges.  It would be a criminal offence for me to contact the Director of Public Prosecutions on this matter.  Legislation to this effect was enacted by a national coalition Government in 1974.  I have limited scope for initiative in this area.The other bodies mentioned jealously guard their independence, as they must, in the context of prosecutorial discretion and the preparation of cases.  Just a few weeks ago, a Minister of State resigned because he wrote a letter pertaining to a summons.  I do not understand how I am supposed to correspond with the authorities on these matters.  Naturally I share the public unease about the delays that have already arisen because it is important these matters are brought to justice as quickly as possible.  I agree with Deputy Burton's earlier comments in that regard.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	647	The Office of Public Works is the lead agency for flood risk management in Ireland.  In carrying out its role, the OPW undertakes a number of work programmes where its responsibilities are delivered directly through its own resources and in some instances in conjunction with other agencies such as local authorities.  The key elements of these programmes are: major capital flood defence schemes; minor coastal and non-coastal schemes; strategic flood risk management studies; and arterial drainage maintenance.In the last five years the OPW has expended approximately €243 million in flood risk management activities in the State.  This has enabled the OPW to progress major flood relief schemes in towns such as Clonmel, County Tipperary, Mallow, County Cork, Ennis, County Clare, Fermoy, County Cork and Waterford city.  Major areas of Dublin city have also been given standard flood protection through schemes carried out on the rivers Tolka and Dodder in this period.  A number of major schemes in other areas have also been advanced through the feasibility process which include such towns as Bray, County Wicklow, Templemore, County Tipperary, Enniscorthy, County Wexford and Arklow, County Wicklow.In 2009, I initiated a minor flood and coastal protection works programme through which the OPW is providing funding for minor localised flood relief works or studies to be undertaken by local authorities.  This programme has continued in 2010 with local authorities being asked to submit applications for cost beneficial projects up to a maximum of €500 million each.In recent years the OPW has been developing and implementing a strategic flood risk management programme.  In this regard the OPW is rolling out a series of flood risk management plans which will allow an integrated approach in the identification and management of significant flood risk.  These studies will underpin the development of the OPW's investment and expenditure programme in the medium term.The OPW also undertakes ongoing maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes and urban flood relief schemes.  Approximately 11,300 km of channels and 675 km of flood defence embankments are maintained under this programme.  The Government has allocated approximately €68.3 million towards flood risk management in 2010, including €50 million for capital flood risk activities and approximately €18.3 million for ongoing drainage maintenance and hydrometric activities.Under the capital allocation in 2010, the OPW will complete the first phases of major flood relief schemes in Mallow, Ennis, Waterford, Clonmel and Fermoy as well as commencing the second phases in each of these areas.  Construction works will continue in Mornington, County Meath and on the River Dodder in Dublin.  The OPW has also committed to undertaking a full feasibility study of the flooding problem in Bandon, County Cork, and will also progress works identified in the River Lee CFRAM plan.  The allocation will also allow work to continue in rolling out the nationwide catchment flood risk plans.  An initial allocation of €6 million has also been made for the minor works scheme which will be reviewed when all applications for assistance have been received.In recognition of the flooding situation countrywide, the OPW has profiled expenditure of approximately €300 million until 2014 with expenditure in excess of €200 million being profiled on capital works alone in this period.  I am confident this expenditure under the current work programmes being undertaken by the Office of Public Works will reduce the national level of flood risk to people, businesses, infrastructure and the environment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	650	Incidents described as 200 year events have happened on more than one occasion in the past two years.  Is the planning model for flood relief being followed by the OPW up to standard given the changes that are clearly taking place in climactic conditions?  Has he reviewed the priority needed to be given to flood relief in light of the events of the last few years?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	651	A number of Deputies are offering and I would like to facilitate all of them.

Obviously, flood defence works cannot provide absolute guarantees against all eventualities.  I refer to a situation in the UK in a place called Cockermouth which had one in 100 defences in place.  As I understand it, 12 inches of rain fell in eight hours and those defences were overrun.  We should bear that in mind.  In the Irish context where works have been completed the results have been very satisfactory.  I refer to the town of Carrick-on-Suir which is very close to Clonmel.  It has not been flooded in recent years but Clonmel has, although one is only a short distance up stream from the other.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	653	Is there a whole of Government approach to this issue?  Is there someone, perhaps the Minister of State, who joins up the dots in respect of his colleague in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  While floods were persecuting many families and farms throughout the west and south west, the reality for those in west and north County Dublin was that water tankers were providing water for many weeks because the water was literally dripping away through the pipes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	654	A brief question, if the Deputy would oblige me.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	655	Does the Minister of State take responsibility for the whole of the river basin?  Has the Minister of State been party to any review about the slowness of the relief, especially to families in the Shannon area, from the Red Cross and other agencies, which has been little short of disgraceful?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I welcome the fact that the Minister has put the OPW, Office of Public Works, as the lead agency with regard to works to be co-ordinated and carried out.  However, I was absolutely disappointed at the meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, at which seven or eight agencies made presentations with regard to flooding on the Shannon and how it might be alleviated.  Each agency, one after the other, declared on their importance and patch.  Unless some real effort is put in by the Minister of State, these agencies will not be willing to relinquish any power they have.  In south Galway, a vast area of land is still flooded.  Some three months later nothing has happened to indicate progress.  Will the Minister of State provide the list of places where the works might be carried out and when this might happen at the earliest possible convenience?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The Office of Public Works is not responsible for water management.  We have a co-ordinating and a lead agency role in respect of flood protection and defence.  We must work with other agencies.  The floods directive will be transposed into law and my senior colleague will take a final look at the matter this week.  Other agencies will be required to co-ordinate with the Office of Public Works in terms of their plans and procedures.  After that passes into law, it will not be the case that the Office of Public Works will assume dictatorial powers.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	658	It should do so.

I do not have direct responsibility for that; it is the bailiwick of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  However, it works extraordinarily well in Clonmel and this was the case on two occasions last year as well.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	660	Is the Minister of State or the Government doing anything to offer protection in cases of private householders or commercial enterprises which cannot get insurance cover as a consequence of several incidents with long-term consequences occurring within a very short time?  Is the Minister of State taking any measures to offer those people comfort?
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I refer to the overall review and the recent floods in the context of my constituency in Limerick.  Many of the floods were man made.  The Minister of State should examine two elements of the problem that affected various people along the Shannon and the ESB.  There is a general view that water could have been released earlier and over a longer period.  I refer to very simple measures such as early warning systems to locate all the people in affected areas by mobile phones and so forth.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I refer to insurance cover.  Insurance companies are influenced by where flood defence schemes or even minor measures are being carried out.  For example, I have been informed that in the case of Ballinasloe if certain simple things are done, insurance would be resumed.  When the scheme is complete in Clonmel insurance will be provided, which has not been the case for several years.  Deputy O'Donnell has put forward a valid point, which is why the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with me, issued floodplain planning guidelines in December.  Some of the problems are man made and the purpose of the guideline is to try to ensure as far as possible that they cease to be made, at least as a result of planning decisions.  There will be a CFRAM, catchment flood risk assessment and management, study for the Shannon from the estuary up to the pot.Some early warning systems are in place already but more need to be put in place and that is part of the plan.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	663	My Department has already changed its organisational structure and its deployment of staff in response to recent events in the economy and the financial system.  It has demonstrated considerable flexibility in dealing with these issues.  I am satisfied with the performance of my Department, especially in light of the extraordinary demands placed on it in the period since I came to office.  The Department has helped me to address some tremendous challenges during this period, as we sought to stabilise the country's finances, restore confidence in its banking system and ensure that the country can re-establish its competitiveness.  There is a good deal more work to be done and I expect to be able to call on the resources of the Department and the resourcefulness and dedication of its staff in dealing with the rapidly changing environment.  Organisational change and development should be a continuing process and I expect further changes in the organisation of the Department of Finance to take place as the need arises.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I read the high level statement of the Department, which sets its targets.  These include a high performing public service, value for money, a regulatory structure that secures public confidence, an effectively functioning banking system and budgetary stability.  If anyone sought a comprehensive statement of everything that has gone wrong in the past three or four years, it is available in that list.  However, the annual output statement of the Department declares "delivered" beside each of these targets; that is to say, the Department has delivered a reformed public service, a regulatory structure with public confidence, budgetary stability and an effectively functioning banking system.  Who is it fooling?  These things have not been delivered.  We must have a more realistic approach.It has been widely speculated that a Department of public service reform will be established.  Does the Minister support the establishment of such a body in view of the ineffectiveness in his Department in delivering public service reform?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	665	As the Deputy is aware, that is a matter for which the Taoiseach is responsible to the House.

The public service reform agenda is central to the work of my Department.  The way in which it will be managed in the future has been discussed between the Taoiseach and me, but it is a matter for the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, to make final decisions on this matter and I will not pre-empt those.  I should say though that the current position is public service change management is shared between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.On economic strategy——
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	669	Is it working?

The consensus of international commentary in recent months demonstrates clearly that there is in operation a very definite strategy that has commanded considerable confidence and support outside this country.  What we must do is translate that confidence and support in Ireland that is manifesting itself so strongly outside the country in recent weeks into confidence and faith in ourselves.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	671	How many economists and persons with technical professional qualifications in banking and in accountancy work in the Department?  Why has such a large chunk of his Department's responsibilities been effectively outsourced to the NTMA?  The NTMA, which has a good record, cannot take responsibility for the entire running of the country.People feel the performance of the Department of Finance has been underwhelming in the context of the crisis.  Is this to do with the type of personnel?  How many qualified economists and qualified accountants are there in the Department?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I indicated in my written reply of 19 January last that of the 560.78 whole-time equivalent staff at my Department at the end of 2009, there were 57 officers who held degrees in economics and related disciplines, 44 who hold a master's-graduate qualification in economics and related disciplines, and two who hold a PhD.Specifically in the banking area, the Department retained two banking experts — one through direct employment and one through an existing private sector exchange arrangement — to supplement on an in-house basis the external expert advisory services retained on my behalf.  The Department also has an in-house legal expert on loan from the Office of the Attorney General.  These arrangements are important and are kept under review.

I want to put on the record of the House my acknowledgement of the long hours spent by many senior officers of my Department in tackling the problems.  Deputy Burton has been given many opportunities to brief herself by my officials on various aspects of our economic problems.  As she will be aware, I am not permitted to know the content of any such discussions.  Certainly, there have been many official briefings of the Opposition parties on matters which arose.

If that occurred in the normal business world questions would be asked.On the same theme, how many new staff with specific master's degrees in economics, accountancy or tax specialties has the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, taken on since he came into office?  Does the Department have the requisite skills within it to deal with the current financial crisis?  It is fair comment that last year we received no tax revenue targets until April.  This year we are running significantly behind.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	688	Deputy O'Donnell is imparting information rather than seeking it.

Qualification is an ongoing process in any Department, although I would have doubts about the capacity of the senior persons in the Department of Finance to undergo further qualification and study at present given the volume of business that they must transact.  There is ongoing education and training in any Department, and especially in the Department of Finance.Regarding the NTMA, I wanted to reply to Deputy Burton.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not object to me dealing with it because it is an important question.  The deputy secretary general who had charge of the banking crisis became the Secretary General of the Department, as Deputies will be aware, and at that stage I deemed it appropriate that the assistance of the NTMA should be available to the Department in direct negotiations with the financial institutions.  I felt it important that this should be done.  In fact, the relevant legal documentation has not yet been executed, but in practice there is a protocol and the negotiations with the different guaranteed institutions are conducted by the NTMA with my Department.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The Minister states that the economic strategy is perfect.  Is he stating that the regulatory failures have nothing to do with the Department?  Is he stating that the collapse of competitiveness in this economy has nothing to do with the Department?  Has the zero progress on public service reform nothing to do with the Department?  These matters are core to an effective economic strategy.  Against that background, how can the Minister pretend that there is an adequate economic strategy?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	693	A brief final reply.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	695	That is the only change, which was a command and control change.  It was not reform.

Indeed, it is the change that has excited international approval because it is seen as a Government clearly in command.  That is the most important message that Ireland must send out at present.We are holding an inquiry into banking, and no doubt we will have an inquiry into other matters.  The scope of that inquiry will give ample time to look back and see where there were failings in the system.  I am not standing up here denying that there were failures in the past, but if there were failures, they were failures of a similar type to those which took place in many other countries as well.  What I can speak of is the response that was required by the Department to those failures.  The response was swift and the quality of advice I received on an appropriate response to the crisis that emerged was sound.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	699	The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 made provision for a reduction in the salaries of public servants with effect from 1 January 2010.  Under section 6 of the Act, I varied the application of the pay reductions for the assistant secretary and deputy secretary grades in the Civil Service, and related public service grades, to take account of the reduction in remuneration which had already taken place for these grades arising from the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay.Section 3 of the Act provides that, for those public servants currently in receipt of a pension or those public servants retiring up to 31 December next, the pay reductions would be disregarded for the purpose of calculating their pension benefits.  This provision applies equally to all public servants who are subject to the legislation irrespective of their salary and, accordingly, no discriminatory impacts arise.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Is it not the case that bonuses were non-pensionable and that what the Minister has allowed is that senior public servants would see a cut in a non-pensionable allowance instead of a proposed cut in their pensionable pay, and, therefore, the implications are that their pensions have been protected where every other public service had to see an effect not only on their serving pay, but on their pensions into the distant future?  Typically, this is worth €17,000, half of which is a pension of some €8,500 in perpetuity.  Is this not another element of unfairness in the way the Minister handled this in respect of pension entitlements?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The error in what Deputy Bruton suggests this afternoon is that there has been no change in pension entitlements.  Pensions are linked to the previous rates.  There has been no change in the basis of the calculation of pension and, therefore, no question of discrimination can arise.  Everyone, for pension purposes, has been treated in the same way as they were treated before the budget, and that remains the case for the duration of this year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	702	That is nonsense and the Minister knows it.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The Minister is like the Red Queen in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland stating that if he says it is, it is.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I welcome Deputy Bruton's interruption.  However, no final decision has been taken on how the pension issue will be addressed and, therefore, it is incorrect to suggest that there is any discriminatory effect at this stage.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	706	Has the Minister any appreciation of the fact that the majority of civil servants earn under €50,000 a year?  Those civil servants are facing a cut of approximately 5% under the emergency measures.  Civil servants, however, at the top of the scale, some 700, in the Minister's Department, the Health Service Executive and other various public bodies are taking a cut of only 3%.  If the Minister wanted to make special provisions for senior management and assistant secretaries, why did he not take the honest course and announce it on budget day?  Instead, it was done by a sleight of hand which has resulted in disaffection among low-paid civil servants.The Minister spoke about pensions in his earlier reply to Deputy Bruton.  Many low-paid public servants relied on quantities of overtime to top up their salaries but this has been either lost or cut severely.  There has been no alteration in the rest of their pay reduction to reflect that they relied on a percentage of overtime.  However, the Minister did recognise this for the bonuses of the higher paid.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	707	We dealt with this matter on the last Question Time.  Today's question relates to pension provisions.  I do not believe there is any profit in going over the same ground again; suffice to say that the former bonus arrangement was treated as remuneration for the purposes of a particular grade that was benchmarked.  If the bonus were withdrawn from this grade, it would have had a greater reduction in salary than a grade senior to them.  It must be also pointed out that when benchmarked, their salaries were already at an international norm and were not significantly in breach of any of them.  The Deputy referred to them being in my Department.  They are in many other Departments, as well as local authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.

What I indicated today was that we have a period to devise an appropriate solution until the end of the year and that no solution has yet been agreed or decided upon by the Government.As regards Deputies Morgan and Burton, I understand many people are unemployed as a result of the economic recession.  I also understand many people's incomes have come under pressure, not just in the public but in the private sector.  Of course I understand these matters.  The task of the Government, however, is to ensure it puts the economy on the road to recovery.  That requires certain basic decisions be taken and not evaded.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I welcome the opportunity to deal with the issue that has arisen with regard to the reading of X-rays at Tallaght hospital.  Patients have a right to expect the best possible standards of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care in hospital and the Government is committed to ensuring this is achieved consistently, across all hospitals.In the case of X-rays, best practice is that they should generally be seen by and formally reported on by a consultant radiologist.  It is clear this did not happen in the case of 57,921 X-rays in Tallaght hospital.  I am advised these X-rays were seen by doctors involved in the patients' care and referred for assessment by a radiologist but that they were not formally reported on by a radiologist.  In this context, the X-rays in question constitute about 6% of the total X-rays taken over the period.  The remaining 94% were reviewed and reported on by a radiologist.  The CEO of Tallaght hospital has acknowledged this practice fell below appropriate clinical standards and was not acceptable.When an issue of this kind arises, there is a clearly established serious incident protocol for dealing with it.  This was established by the HSE with the support of the Department of Health and Children.  The protocol puts patients' interests first and foremost in all actions to be taken.  It requires that one must correct or cease the practice that has given rise to the concern; consider the need for and if necessary undertake a clinical review of patients who have been through the service to identify any whose care or treatment may have been adversely affected as a result and to immediately provide them with appropriate care; and consider whether an investigation of what happened and why is required in order to address any systemic failures and minimise the risk of a similar occurrence in the future.The CEO of Tallaght hospital has confirmed that since September 2009 all X-rays are now read and reported on by a suitably qualified consultant radiologist.  This is the first step and is designed to avoid risk of harm to further patients.  The clinical review is already well under way.  As the CEO explained, approximately 60% of the total X-rays involved have been reviewed and the aim is to complete the review by May.  The HSE has announced that it is to carry out an investigation into the circumstances that led to the accumulation of unreported X-rays.  The investigation will be chaired by a person independent of Tallaght hospital and the HSE.  The details of the investigation will be announced in the coming days.  The priority now is to ensure that the remaining X-rays are reviewed so that any patients requiring further follow-up are identified and provided with the necessary services.  The protocol is very clear that cases should first be reviewed and patients informed where these is a need for follow-up.  Only then should the question of publicising the matter arise.  The fact that the information relating to this incident became public while the hospital was still in the process of reviewing X-rays has meant that, unfortunately, many patients have been given cause for unnecessary distress and worry.It is for this reason that the new HSE director of clinical care, Dr. Barry White, and the recently appointed national lead for radiology, Dr. Risteárd Ó Laoide, consultant radiologist at St Vincent's Hospital and Dean of the Faculty of Radiologists, along with other senior HSE executives, are attending Tallaght hospital today to see if the clinical review can be further expedited.  I very much regret any distress caused to patients by the manner and timing in which this came into the public domain.  It is important to stress that the vast majority of patients have no cause for concern and would have been reassured in that regard once the clinical review had been completed.The reading of X-rays is not a precise or exact science.  However, the available evidence is that the risk in this cohort of patients is extremely low.  Of the 34,752 X-rays reviewed to date, it appears that just two patients had a delayed diagnosis.  One of these patients died last summer and the other is receiving treatment in the hospital.  The hospital is continuing with its clinical review and in the event any patient requires treatment, this will be made available immediately by the hospital.I want to deal with the question of when my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, became aware of this situation.  The matter was first mentioned to her by the newly appointed CEO of Tallaght hospital on 15 December 2009 after a meeting with him, the Master of the Coombe and officials of the Department on another matter.  It was one of a number of initial priorities the CEO, who had just taken up his position, intended to address.  However, it was only yesterday that the Minister became aware of the nature and scale of the situation.  It was not raised as a significant patient safety issue.  The hospital had not brought the matter to the attention of the Department.That being said, the critical issue, as far as the Minister is concerned, is whether the matter has been and is being managed appropriately by the hospital.  On the basis of the information provided to her so far, the Minister is satisfied the new CEO has, since his appointment, accorded this the priority it warrants.  Dr. Barry White has also confirmed the hospital has taken the necessary action to address the risks to patients arising from this situation.The most important thing is to complete the clinical review, identify whether any patients need further treatment and if so provide the necessary services and reassure any other patients who may have concerns about their X-rays.  As soon as that has been done, we can focus on the investigation that has already been announced by the HSE.  The serious incident management protocol is key to putting patients' interests first and it must guide us in all of the actions to be taken.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I regret very much that the Minister saw fit to go away for St Patrick's day one week in advance and that she is not here to answer questions.  One part of my question concerns what action the Minister took and it appears she took no action whatsoever.  I have number of questions for the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, and his colleagues arising from his response.  Knowing that there are more than 20,000 outstanding X-rays that have not yet been examined by radiologists, how can he say that this is of low concern, if that is the phrase he used?  How can this be so?  We do not know what is in the 20,000 outstanding X-rays.  We know that one patient has died already and another has had a delayed diagnosis.  The Taoiseach gave a similar reply this morning and I was astonished at the suggestion that with 20,000 outstanding X-rays, we can blandly say it is acceptable to take time over this because there is probably no issue for other patients.  We do not know that.  I ask the Minister of State to address this so that the rest of the X-rays are examined as quickly as possible.Regarding the Minister's knowledge of the issue, on "Morning Ireland" Professor Conlon said:I explained to the Minister and I explained to the HSE the issue we had with radiology.  I also explained to her that we were going to deal with it and I explained to her that we were going to deal with it by bringing extra consultants in and that we were going to clear this backlog as fast as is humanly possible.Does that not indicate there was a considerable amount of information given to the Minister at that time in December?  Does the Minister of State know if the Minister for Health and Children was told of the numbers involved?  We know that Professor Conlon knew the numbers at that stage.  Did the Minister for Health and Children ask to be kept informed of progress on the issue?  The statement by HIQA suggests it was told the backlog would be removed by the end of March.  Does the Minister know why this did not happen?  The HIQA statement suggests this would happen by March.Of the X-rays not reviewed, how many involved private patients and how many involved public patients?  Was each X-ray assigned a number?  The Minister indicated they may have been assigned a radiologist but the radiologist never examined the X-rays.  Can the Minister of State clarify this point?The main point I am concerned about is that the Minister was given substantial information in December.  The CEO had the full information on the number, over 57,000 outstanding.  Can the Minister of State provide any reassurance to the public why the Minister for Health and Children did not act on this information or take responsibility?  It is very hard to have confidence in the Minister for Health and Children in the context of all the information she had regarding previous incidents of misdiagnosis and the recommendations in the public domain.  When she was given this information about a large publicly funded hospital she appears to have totally ignored it and is not in the Chamber to answer questions.  These issues are extremely serious for patient confidence in the health services.  There remain many outstanding questions and I hope the Minister of State can answer them.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	718	Deputy O'Sullivan rightly began her contribution by concentrating on the reassurance we can give to patients listening to this debate or hearing reports of it.  The information I have to hand is that when HIQA began to involve itself in this issue, it was satisfied that the risk stratification process had been contemplated in a manner in which the reviews of these X-rays would take place after December so that in the initial stages the more serious cases would be examined.  Given an issue has arisen in only two of the X-rays already reviewed — there is nothing about which we can be complacent — remaining patients who have not yet been contacted can be reassured to a certain extent.  There obviously remains a great deal of work to do.  However, the most important message that we should put out today is that this work will be expedited and people will be informed without any further delay.Deputy O'Sullivan also asked about the state of knowledge of the Minister for Health and Children.  As I mentioned in my opening comments, the Minister was informed of the matter in December following a meeting on another subject.  It was not an agenda item for that meeting and was not brought to her attention as a patient safety issue.  The matter was brought to her attention in the context of it being an issue about which they wished to inform her but in respect of which they did not wish her to take any action.  There is no doubt in any——

However, I can assure him that nobody is in any doubt in terms of the competence of the newly appointed CEO at Tallaght hospital to deal with this issue.  Equally, the Minister for Health and Children had absolute confidence that Professor Conlon would discharge his responsibilities, namely, that the practice had ceased and that the review would commence.  Deputy O'Sullivan quoted what Professor Conlon had to say on radio this morning, namely, that he told the Minister that extra consultants were being appointed and that this would be done as quickly as humanly possible.  I believe the Minister was entitled to rely on the information as represented to her at the time.  For this reason, the Minister, as stated, left it to the hospital to deal with the situation, which was right and proper.

I cannot inform the House of the exact nature of the conversation that took place.  Deputy O'Sullivan also asked the number of public and private patients involved.  I do not have that information either.I must, without being overly political on a serious issue about which people are concerned, take the Deputy to task and reiterate that the Minister has displayed a considerable commitment to patient safety through the establishment of the commission on patient safety, the Medical Council and Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It is quite possible that without HIQA we would not know all of this information and that the matter might not have been resolved as quickly.

We know that the new CEO learned of the situation on his appointment in December.  When prior to that was the situation in this regard known about and by whom?  I understand the Minister was informed of the position around that time and that she is claiming she was not made aware of the number of X-rays involved.  We are told this situation was discovered some time in December.  However, it was the CEO who discovered it then.  When, prior to that, was this situation known?We are now in the middle of March and the HSE clinical director and a number of other big shots are only today going to visit the hospital to discuss the matter despite that this situation has been known about since at least end of December.  Why were those big shots not called to the hospital long before now to sort of out what could or should be done?  Why did they wait until now to do this?  Is it because the matter is in the public domain and is being reported on by the media and discussed in this House?  Are they trying to dampen it down?  Why were they not called in long before now?  Will the Minister of State give us a categorical assurance that the remainder of the X-rays will be read and will he provide us with a specific timeframe or aspirational date in this regard so that people who are concerned about their health, some possibly with cancer, their families and the many thousands of people well beyond the 58,000 mentioned here, can be put at ease?The Minister of State in his opening remarks stated that the 58,000 X-rays represented 6% of all X-rays carried out at Tallaght hospital and that 94% of X-rays had been read.  It sounded to me as though the Minister of State — perhaps he will clarify this — regards a 6% error rate as being not too bad at all.  I believe a 1% error rate is a scandal.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify his position in this regard.  It is extremely important that he do so.  Does the Minister of State accept that this Government is wrecking the health service and that the Fianna Fáil element of this Government has been wrecking our health service for more than 20 years now and will not settle until such time as it has privatised the whole shooting gallery, which clearly is its political agenda?  For the purpose of clarity, I do not seek to hang this matter around the neck of the current Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, and his colleagues but, broadly, that has been the political agenda of Fianna Fáil Governments for more than 20 years now.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The exact details of who knew what and when will be explored by the investigation announced by the HSE.  I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of that inquiry.  I can say that HIQA was first informed of the matter on 24 April 2009.  On the manner of the issue coming into the public domain, it is good that these matters do come into the public domain.  However, the sequence within which they do so is unfortunate.  Clearly we would wish to first complete the review and to inform all patients and families likely to be affected before putting the issue into the public domain.  Members present in the House today know there was no intention not to put it in the public domain.  HIQA would have done so anyway.  It would not be behind the door in ensuring that happened.  The correct sequence would be as outlined earlier.The timeframe for completion of the existing reviews was May.  As I mentioned earlier Professor Conlon represented to the Minister in December that he would do everything he could to ensure the matter was addressed as quickly as possible.  However, now that the matter is in the public domain and there may be some disquiet and some reassurance required, the clinical director of the HSE, Dr. Barry White, is meeting the consultant radiologist at Tallaght hospital today to ensure further resources are drawn in.  Naturally, the question as to why this was not done from day one will be asked.  Obviously, this will require us to draw on other resources and as everybody in this House knows, when they put their politics to one side——

Would the Taoiseach like to revisit his own position on the issue this morning?  In my view, he showed scant regard for the cases already addressed, which have led to the loss of one life and the diagnosis of cancer in another case.  There are also 14,000 patients who are obviously in great distress in the absence of certainty about their health situation.  There was no understanding in the Taoiseach's responses this morning and he made a big effort to minimise what was involved here.  There was no apology to the people concerned, their families and their loved ones.  That is surely where we should have started.How can it be claimed that this is not every bit as serious as the previous cases of misdiagnosis?  In this situation we are looking at no diagnosis or delayed diagnosis, which is every bit as serious.  People need to know that what is happening in Tallaght is not also the situation applying at other hospital sites the length and breadth of this State.  There are 14,000 patients for whom around 23,000 X-rays have not been read.  Every available resource should be employed to expedite this process because it could happen to anyone.  As this situation might apply to other hospitals, the concerns could be expressed by anybody across the country, including our family, friends, neighbours and extended communities.  People want to know how this could have happened in the first place.  How is it possible for neglect to take place on this scale?Our former Dáil colleague and now Councillor Seán Crowe raised this issue regarding Tallaght hospital two years ago, following a row-back on the services and a shortage of staff.  I pulled up the various statements we issued at the time he highlighted the shortage of radiologists at Tallaght.  That was two years ago when he gave expression to what the service providers at the hospital were saying, as well as those who had a direct interest in ensuring it was a hospital of high repute.  Has a shortage of radiologists and other staff directly contributed to the failure of consultant radiologists to read these X-rays over the 2005 to 2009 period?  I fear the answer is "Yes".  The Minister of State should provide more information on this because his opening statement is simply not good enough.Where was the management of the consultants?  How do these people function if they can get away with completely ignoring one of their core responsibilities in our hospital network?  Who manages, oversees or ensures that these consultants are doing their work?  Does all this go into an office where nobody has any oversight responsibility and where nobody asks a question until the crisis erupts and appears on the floor of this Chamber?  Where are the checks and balances in the hospital system to make sure that people are doing the job which they are employed to do?Reading the HIQA statement causes even more alarm.  A local GP told officials from HIQA in April 2009 about unopened orthopaedic referral letters from general practitioners and a backlog of radiology reporting in Tallaght.

Is there a parallel inquiry or investigation into the number of unopened orthopaedic referral letters and other referral letters from GPs to that hospital or any other hospital?  How many consultant radiologists were in Tallaght between 2005 and 2009?  How does the Minister of State account for the fact that the former CEO of the hospital told officials from HIQA last June that there were only 4,000 unreported X-rays and that it was only with the advent of a new chief executive that we discovered the number is 57,000?  The figures did not jump from 4,000 to 57,000 in the last six months of 2009 because they cover a four year period from 2005.  Will this discrepancy be investigated?

Is the Minister negligent for not inquiring about the number of cases involved when this matter was first raised in December?  Has she made inquiries about the matter since?  We are now in the second week of March.  I find the situation absolutely incredible.  She needs to explain her role as Minister.  Does she believe that acting in the interest of patients by the Minister for Health and Children equates to meddling, as she claimed on "Morning Ireland"?  I find that absolutely outrageous.  She has a responsibility to ensure that we receive best care and best practice in all our acute hospitals.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I agree that, on the face of it, these practices were absolutely unacceptable.  It is unfortunate that it had to come to light through a doctor like Professor O'Dowd, who informed HIQA of the matter.  If I were able to answer all the questions the Deputy has put there would be no need for an investigation.  If I were able to put on the record of the House the reason it happened, the management failures that caused it to happen and whether it was based on a lack of resources, there would be no need for an investigation but there is a need for an investigation.  The Health Service Executive has announced it.  It has not announced who the chair will be or the terms of reference but I am sure today's debate will allow the HSE to inform the terms of reference to ensure they not only reveal exactly what went wrong but also restore public confidence in the process that happens in all our hospitals.Deputy Ó Caoláin asked whether this could have happened in other hospitals.  It is possible that it could have happened in other hospitals and that is the reason, as part of the reforms introduced by the Minister, Deputy Harney, the clinical director of the HSE has appointed a clinical lead specifically for radiology to ensure that problems such as these are tackled directly by the HSE, in conjunction with the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance and HIQA, to achieve the best standards in this country.I understand there are 12 radiologists in Tallaght hospital at present.  As the Deputy said, the new chief executive officer tackled this issue with great speed.  As I have already said, the Minister was informed at a meeting that was set up for a different purpose.  It was not presented to her as a patient safety issue.  Professor Conlon represented to the Minister that it was a matter that was in hand, that the adverse incident protocol was being followed properly and that the correct time to put it in the public domain was when each patient and his or her family was properly informed of the circumstances surrounding the failure to properly report on all of these X-rays.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	763	Free of charge, to boot.This is a very serious matter.  We have had scandal after scandal in this country.  Patients have suffered.  Patients have died.  Families have suffered.  The position is that the X-rays of 20,000 people have not been read three months after that became obvious.  A major question arises about that too.  In its statement this morning HIQA stated that staff from the authority met with the former chief executive on 24 June who reported that there were approximately 4,000 unreported X-rays.  On a radio programme this morning, however, Professor Tom O'Dowd intimated that there were 20,000 when he asked HIQA in April to get involved.  I find it extraordinary that HIQA took the word of a third party in this matter.Furthermore, what happened between June and December of 2009 when the hospital knew this problem existed?  When did remedial action start?  When did action start in regard to reading these X-rays which had not been checked by a consultant radiologist?  We must be clear about this.  The minimum standard that anybody is entitled to when they have an X-ray taken is that it is reviewed by a consultant radiologist in a timely fashion.  There are scores of stories of people who have had X-rays read at night by doctors who were not radiologists and serious fractures were missed.  We heard of one on the radio this morning involving a lady who was X-rayed, sent home and eight weeks later told her spine was fractured.  That person is lucky that she is not paralysed.  That is a failure of our State.The report from HIQA states that the medical director, Professor Kevin Conlon, who is now the chief executive officer, met HIQA in August.  It is clear, therefore, that he knew about this in August.  I put it to the Minister, however, that as a medical director he must have known about this problem before August and if he did not we have to wonder why.  I find it astonishing that HIQA would not have informed the Minister for Health and Children of this serious problem.It is now clear, having read the HIQA statement, that it is not acceptable for it to rely on third party information when a figure of 4,000 is given that six months later transpires to be 57,000.  I said earlier that families have suffered.  People have suffered and died in Portlaoise hospital, in the north east, Drogheda, Cork, Ennis, Limerick, Galway and now Tallaght.  I must put it to the Minister, and to all the Ministers present, that this is one scandal and one death too many.I am taken by the Minister's statement that the first thing to do is correct or cease the practice which has given rise to the concern.  When was that done?  Was it in mid-December when it should have been done in April or August?  He further stated that the second thing to consider is the necessity to undertake a clinical review of patients.  When did that begin?  Was it April, August or December 2009?  The Minister stated that the third thing to do was to consider an investigation.  We are hearing today that we will get an investigation but that is only because it is in the public arena because a whistleblower, Fergal Bowers, had the courage to tell somebody about what was going on.I put it to the Minister that not everything that should have been done has been done.  The State failed these patients yet again.  When this was discovered in December, if that is when it was discovered, and the Minister was informed, if she was a dutiful Minister she would have kept a watching brief on this issue every week.  She would have ensured that resources were made available to the chief executive officer to bring in other radiologists from around the greater Dublin area, and beyond if necessary, to get through this work within a month.  A person has died because that was not done.  They may have died anyway but I say to the Minister of State that not enough effort was made.  I put it to the Minister also that one person has died and another has been diagnosed with cancer.  There are still 20,000 X-rays to be read and there is every chance, statistically, that another cancer will be found.Not enough effort was made.  This matter should have been resolved within a month, all the resources made available and the public announcement made but this Government appears to have a problem with releasing information and reports, and the Minister in particular seems to have that problem.  The Minister stated that he very much regrets any distress caused to patients by the manner and timing in which this came into the public domain——

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	765	Excuse me, I want to remind the Minister of State of what he said.  I did not hear an apology to the family of the patient who died, the persons whose delayed diagnosis may have impaired their recovery or the parents, families and friends of the patients concerned for the distress caused by the problem, not by the manner in which it was leaked.  That is the issue.  I do apologise, on behalf of my own party and, I am sure, every Member of this Dáil, for the State's failure yet again under this so-called reforming Minister, who is too busy in New Zealand to be in this House to address this issue, and we know she knew about it before she travelled.I want to ask some salient questions.  On what date was the serious incident protocol the Minister alluded to established?  What is the position in other hospitals such as Beaumont, my own hospital, Blanchardstown hospital, Cavan hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and Cork University Hospital?  Are these practices going on in those hospitals?  Are X-rays that have not been read by consultant radiologists piled up in a corner in those hospitals?  We need to know the answers to these questions.HIQA has not covered itself in glory on this issue.  We asked it a question and it stated it must get assurance from the hospitals that this is not the case.  It must go into those hospitals and check, on behalf of the Irish people, that the hospitals are safe and that there are not X-rays waiting to be reviewed.  It should not take somebody's word on that and walk away.I would point out, in regard to Tallaght hospital, information which came to me from my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, who is in the Chamber.  There are only 12 radiologists in Tallaght hospital, which the Minister has confirmed, yet it sees nearly twice as many people per annum in its outpatients department, and nearly twice as many people in its accident and emergency department, as St. Vincent's, which has 16 radiologists.This is chronic under-resourcing and a failure by the Minister to face up to her responsibilities.  I refer to the continued approach whereby the Minister says she was told about a matter but left it to others to review.  I refer also to the disingenuousness of saying, "I do not meddle."The Minister had better wake up and realise there is a huge difference between managing and meddling.  What she has done is mismanage.  I, for one, found she has been grossly ineffective, has dithered and should resign.  No doubt we will receive more evidence of her wonderful approach to reform.  The Minister of State should note that the Minister's main plank of reform regarding bed capacity comprised the now much-discredited co-located hospitals.  With regard to the cancer strategy, recommendations on only one of all the cancers, breast cancer, have been delivered upon.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	770	Deputy Reilly began by referring to numbers.  As he rightly pointed out, reference was made to the number being 4,000 initially.  Professor O'Dowd said on the radio he believed the number was 20,000 at one point.  As we now know, the figure is almost 58,000.  I can only repeat that what has happened is clearly some kind of system failure.  It is totally unacceptable but it has been remedied.  We are in the process of ensuring those patients who are entitled to have their radiology reported on by a consultant will have this done in the next few weeks.  That is the main point on which one must be assured in this discussion.From my experience as a Minister of State with responsibility for children, the role of HIQA, as an inspectorate and body that provides support and advice, has been exceptional.  It has constituted a significant instrument of reform in our health service and the delivery of crucial social services, particularly in the area of child protection.  In the House, we tend to look at issues with the benefit of hindsight.  What appears in hindsight to be obvious is far less clear-cut at the time it occurs.  We tend to judge these matters not with foresight but with hindsight.  In those circumstances, it is possible to be outraged and scandalised as easily as Deputy Reilly is in the House.Deputy Reilly asked when remedial action——

What we know today is that the practice that is subject to this discussion stopped in September.  The look-back began in December at the time of the appointment of the CEO, Professor Conlon.  It was done with all due haste and expedited as quickly as possible, and the Minister was informed accordingly.  We are anxious to get through this work as quickly as possible.  I made the comment in my response that it is unfortunate the information came out in the manner it did.  The main misfortune concerns the reassurance that is necessary for patients today.  The hospital is to have the work done by the end of May and provide assurances in what I hope will be the vast majority of cases.As I stated, HIQA and the hospital are satisfied that a risk stratification process was engaged in so the more serious cases would be examined in the earlier part of the review.  The reforms are real and are bearing fruit.  HIQA is an example of the kind of body needed to improve and restore public confidence in our health services, which are all too often criticised in this House and the media when great work is being done, particularly in the areas of breast cancer and cancer care reform generally.

Is that the position of the Minister as outlined to the House?I understand officials from the Department of Health and Children were present at the famous meeting in December.  Was a note of that meeting taken?  Did it not set off alarm bells given the circumstances in many other hospitals in recent years?  Why did the Minister not appoint additional consultant radiologists to Tallaght hospital at the time in question?  Will the Minister of State confirm whether three additional appointments have been made, bringing the number from 12 to 15, given the fact that this was first raised in the Department in December?Will the Minister of State confirm as a fact that the number of radiologists is to increase to 15?  As Deputy Reilly has just informed the Dáil, the number of radiologists in the hospital is the lowest per volume of patients of any hospital in the State.  The legacy dates from when the hospital was first established.  It was straddled with a debt of over £8 million.  The then Minister for Health and Children, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, allowed that situation to obtain.  His doing so led to the resignation of the then chief executive officer, who went back to Canada because of the straddling of debt in the hospital.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether three additional appointments will be made?  Will he inform the House with certainty that HIQA informed no one in his Department, the HSE or elsewhere about this matter when it first arose?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I wanted to ask some questions asked by Deputy Reilly but to which he did not get answers.  Is one of the difficulties we have that the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and Fianna Fáil are semi-detached from responsibility for health?  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is regarded as not being one of them.  They believe she is in reality but it suits them to say she is not because it allows them to claim, as a consequence, that they cannot get answers.  Consider what occurred at the meeting in December.  Is the Minister of State seriously repeating to the House that, having become aware of the scale of this problem, all Professor Conlon did was mention it on the edges of a meeting to the Minister for Health and Children?  I find that virtually impossible to believe.Bearing in mind the point raised by Deputy Brian Hayes, I find it impossible that HIQA would not bother reporting this to the Department of Health and Children or the HSE.  Is the dereliction of accountability in the health service now so advanced that something of this scale is not even worthy of being reported any more?  Why was the backlog not cleared by March 2010, as committed to?  When will it be cleared?  Have private patients been affected in the same way as public patients?  Did the matter arise because consultants were tied up dealing with their private patients?With regard to the relative caseload at St. Vincent's and Tallaght hospitals, why is the latter so disadvantaged in terms of posts?  Will this be rectified?One assumes St. Patrick's Day will fall, as it traditionally does, on 17 March.  What preparations is it necessary for the Minister to make for the St. Patrick's Day festivities in New Zealand that she cannot be here today to deal with an issue that one suspects she knew very well was in the pipeline.  There must be extensive preparations to be made in Auckland if she has to be there already.  Is this not reminiscent of the famous failure by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to read his brief on nursing home charges, which ended up costing the State an additional €120 million?

She has said she attended a meeting about something else at which somebody whispered in her ear, in passing, that there might be a problem in regard to X-rays.  However, she claims she did not know the scale of the problem until yesterday.  Any Minister who seriously asks this House to accept that he or she did not know about the scale of an issue such as this until yesterday is a Minister who should stay in New Zealand.

I would be deeply upset and concerned were we discussing any hospital in the State; that we are discussing my local hospital, near where I live and in which I have been a patient, shocks me greatly.  It is good to have an opportunity to raise these issues and to express our upset.  My first priority is to stress that patients and their families who are affected by this issue must be looked after.  This hospital caters not only for the area represented by Deputies Rabbitte, Brian Hayes and me; its catchment extends to counties Kildare and Wicklow, as far south as Carnew.  Many people in those areas are deeply upset today.  Deputy Reilly and I were members of the health board for some years and so understand the issues that are particularly relevant to that catchment area, as does Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, my colleague from Kildare, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I am pleased to see Deputy Ó Fearghaíl in the House today.I would like to respond to the points that have been made but do not have sufficient time to do so other than to make one or two brief points.  Reference was made to our local GP, Dr. Tom O'Dowd, who has done a great service to the community in regard to this matter.  As I understand it, he said on national radio this morning that he first brought the issue to the attention of the board of Tallaght hospital by mail last April.  He has confirmed personally to me that he received no reply to this correspondence.  The chairman and other board members must answer for the governance issues that have arisen and must outline how they propose to address this matter.There is an important issue in terms of the communication that must take place with the patients and families affected so that they can be informed of what will happen next.  I hope the Minister of State can offer assurances in this regard.  I would like to say more but have run out of time.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his courtesy in accommodating me.

I am not going to put words in the mouth of HIQA but, broadly speaking, it was satisfied that the process was conforming to that protocol and was following the procedures as indicated.  It is too early to say whether resources were a causative factor in this process; I cannot say whether that is the case, whether it was a question of management systems or a combination of both.  It is difficult to say.  I do not know about any additional consultants being appointed to Tallaght hospital, but I am sure we can elicit that information at a later time.Deputy Rabbitte asked why this matter was raised only in passing with the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Professor Conlon had only just been appointed chief executive officer at the time of the meeting in question and this issue was not on the agenda.  He raised it separately with the Minister, among several issues he wished to bring to her attention which he considered would require his serious attention in the coming weeks.  The Deputy asked why the backlog was not cleared by March 2010 as had been initially represented to HIQA.  I do not have that information to hand, but I reiterate that the clinical director of the HSE has undertaken today to liaise with the hospital in order to finalise these reviews without delay.I was already asked about the public-private mix of patients, and I have no information in that regard.  I will treat the references to St. Patrick's Day as questions of a rhetorical nature.

Broughan — to ask the Minister for Transport to make an urgent statement to the House on the ongoing crisis in the taxi industry given the current industrial action and disruption to services in Dublin, Cork, Galway and cities and towns throughout the State, if he will outline what steps he is taking to review regulations on vehicle standards and age and SPSV license costs and to reform the grossly inadequate regulation of the taxi sector, and if he will make a statement on the matter; (9) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to reconsider his position in regard to the regulation of field sports including stag hunting; (10) Deputy Joe McHugh — the need for the Government to establish community employment schemes for the assignment of those on the live register to projects that will prepare communities for the impending tourism season, in view of the levels of litter in every community and the obvious benefits such community projects would have for the tourism industry; (11) Deputy Seán Sherlock — the need for the Revenue Commissioners to review late payment charges in regard to VAT and income tax; (12) Deputy Joe Carey — to ask the Minister for Health and Children to sanction the use of the dementia unit at Clarecastle day care centre; (13) Deputy Andrew Doyle — the inclusion of horticultural products in the compensation scheme for persons whose crops were damaged recently by frost; (14) Deputy Simon Coveney — how a 16 year old unaccompanied Chinese minor could go missing from HSE care in Carrigaline, County Cork, in January 2010; (15) Deputy Jan O'Sullivan — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline when she first became aware that there were serious problems at Tallaght hospital with regard to the failure to have X-rays reviewed by radiologists, when the HSE was first made aware of the problem, what action she took as a result, what steps are being taken to inform patients whose X-rays were not reviewed, what steps are being taken to speed up the review of outstanding X-rays, and what inquiry will be held to establish the cause of the serious failures at the hospital; (16) Deputy Alan Shatter — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to make urgent contact with the HSE's Dublin south east area concerning the indefensible delay in making available insulin pumps to two young children, in contrast to other HSE areas which make appliances available within two weeks of a child being diagnosed with type one diabetes; (17) Deputy Mary Upton — the need to progress the addition of the chapel at St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, onto the record of protected structures, (18) Deputy Trevor Sargent — that the Government bring forward the means for farmers in north County Dublin and others in business to ensure customer companies pay for produce and that clear public examples are made of persons who flout the letter and spirit of prompt payment legislation which is forcing hard pressed business people such as horticulture producers to put up their own homes as security in order to obtain working capital from the banking sector; and (19) Deputy Róisín Shortall — the proposed abolition of the supply panel and the negative implications of this for school children in disadvantaged areas especially given that there is no financial rationale for such a decision.The matters raised by Deputies Timmy Dooley, Jimmy Devins, Simon Coveney and Mary Upton have been selected for discussion.

The new motion proposes that amendment No. 3 be recommitted to allow further discussion on the amendment if Members so wish.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	814	No.  In more than 20 years in this House I have never seen a proposal from the Government to pull a procedural stroke such as is being attempted today.  Yesterday evening amendment No. 3, which was proposed by Deputy Burton, was passed by the House.  Discussion then proceeded on amendment No. 6 and I understand Deputy Burton was in possession in respect of that amendment.This morning an Order Paper was circulated which provided for, among other things, a guillotine on Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill, but made no reference to returning to amendment No. 3.  The Taoiseach, however, in what was a sleight of hand, when moving the Order of Business moved a proposal that the House shall resume on amendment No. 3, notwithstanding anything which transpired yesterday.  There have been exchanges about that matter and discussions between the Whips in the interval.  The Government Chief Whip has given the same proposal which was read out by the Taoiseach but which was not circulated on the Order of Business before the commencement of business today.I submit to the Ceann Comhairle that what is proposed by the Government Chief Whip is out of order.  Our business is governed by the Standing Orders of the House.  The manner to deal with the Order of Business is set down in Standing Order 26, which provides that every sitting is governed by a printed Order Paper.  The Taoiseach has the right to determine the order in which Government business appears on each day's Order Paper and may also propose arrangements for sittings and the taking of that day's business.  However, today's Order Paper clearly states No. 18 is the Finance Bill — Report Stage, resumed on amendment No. 6.  That and only that is the item of Government business on which a Government motion can be made in respect of the ordering of business; in other words, the Finance Bill resumed on amendment No. 6.Yesterday's amendments were yesterday's business.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to defend the rights of the Members of this House.  There is no provision in the Standing Orders of this House for the motion which the Government Chief Whip has just proposed.  The Government Chief Whip and the Taoiseach in the ordering of business are confined to making proposals in respect of the business which appears on the Order Paper.  The business which appears on the Order Paper is the Finance Bill, resumed on amendment No. 6.  There is no procedure, Standing Order, rule or precedent for moving a motion which departs from the business which is set down in the Order Paper.  There is certainly no precedent, and we will not go along with the setting of a new precedent in this House, whereby business which was transacted yesterday and on which the House made a decision, can be revisited the following day simply because the Government wants to do so and vote it down again.  If that were to happen, we would be in a situation where, on any given day, if the House votes on a matter, the Government, because it did not like the result on day one, can come in the following day and propose a motion such as that proposed by the Government Chief Whip.  This will set an entirely new, unacceptable, undemocratic precedent for this House and we are not having it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	815	The Minister for Finance said the intention of the Government was to oppose this item of business when it was discussed last night, and it went through inadvertently.  In seeking to correct it, it is vital that we do not create a precedent which undermines the rights of the House.  While the Government is trying to mend its hand, which I understand, it seeks to do it in a way which undermines the rights of this House.  When a decision is made in this House, for whatever reason, the Government cannot, by sleight of hand, come in and pretend the decision was never made.  Such an act would undermine the rights of this House.  It is a dangerous precedent which we should not establish.  I understand the Whips considered other options which would have dealt with the problem, from the Government's point of view.  For example, a brief Bill could have dealt with the element which the Government wished to remove or it could have gone to the Seanad to make arrangements.The Ceann Comhairle and Members, irrespective of whether they operate under the Whips to support the Government, need to make sure we protect the rights of this House.  We have already seen the most senior independent public servant, namely, the Ombudsman, draw to our attention the failure of this House to properly hold the Government to account and conduct its business.  It would be extremely ironic, the day after the Ombudsman was so critical of this House, that we would see a further erosion of the manner in which we do our business, diluting again the accountability of Government for decisions and the influence of those who are elected to the House.We should revert to one of the Government's original proposals to deal with this matter.  I cannot see why it would withdraw the amendment because it is a fairly innocent amendment which can do no harm and may do some good.  If it is determined to withdraw it, something which it is entitled to do if it can command a majority, it should do so in accordance with the procedure of the House and not try to establish a new way of doing things.  God knows who will occupy the Chair in years to come.  This precedent may be used in order to allow the rights of Deputies to be trampled upon.

It cannot be acceptable to the House.  It should not be acceptable to the Government.  It is not acceptable to the Opposition, as voices have already recorded, and I add our view to that.  Without question, the Order Paper is exactly as has been read into the record.  It was adopted here this morning.  This is the basis upon which is was decided.  It was determined by Members.  Quite frankly, there is no greater way to describe what is being proposed than a sleight of hand.The natural outworking of this situation in the future could mean that a Government, on so-called mature reflection overnight, could overturn almost any decision which this House makes regarding legislation or any other matter.  The following morning, via the mechanism of the Order of Business, it could dump a decision which has already been taken.  That is unacceptable and is not the way to work.  What confidence can any of us, as elected voices in this Chamber, have in the decision-making process of the Dáil if the Government takes unto itself the right to change a decision of the House the following morning or afternoon by merely introducing a proposition on the Order of Business?  That is what is proposed.  It is unacceptable.  It is a very dangerous proposition and precedent.  By any measurement, in terms of democracy, the rights of voices and due process in terms of the preparation of legislation, it is not acceptable.If the Government has made an error regarding this matter, it has done so, but I join with the previous speaker in making the point that it seems like an eminently sensible and reasonable amendment in the first instance.  I cannot find any excuse which would be acceptable for the mechanism which is now presented to overturn it.  We disagree with it.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The reason we are discussing this is because of the admission by Government that it made a mess of things this morning in trying to deal with a simple matter, where two separate procedures are available to Government to correct the situation, if they so wish.  However, it now wants to use a sledgehammer by setting a dangerous precedent in the House which was never used before in its history.  I have never heard of anything like it. As for quoting Standing Order 26, it sets out the main reasons this cannot be done by the Government.  The Government does not have the authority.  It is ultra vires — beyond its power — to try to introduce something that is not in the green, printed Order Paper for the day.  The Government is not allowed to do that through Standing Orders.We adjourned at 1.20 p.m. to allow the Whips to discuss this matter.  The Whips met in the usual room and all of the Whips attended.  We agreed a procedure to deal with this which is available to the Government and to the Minister, namely, to let this matter go straight through the House to the Seanad, which can return an advice to this House that the Bill should be changed in accordance with the Minister's wishes.  That matter would then simply be put to a vote here, and that would be the end of it.That is the procedure available to correct what I appreciate was a mistake by the Minister and the Government side.  I appreciate and accept it was not the intention of the Minister to allow the decision go the way it went.  However, there is now an easy solution with no risk to the Minister because the Seanad cannot change a Finance Bill in any way or make any amendment.  It can simply advise this House of what it considers a desirable amendment.  The Bill will then come back to this House, where the Minister, with his majority and his lively officials to remind him that a vote is coming up, will ensure the vote is passed with the majority the Government would have on a Finance Bill.  That is the procedure available.There is another alternative the Minister could use and, although it is a bit more complex, it has been used in the House previously, namely, a one-line Finance (No. 2) Bill 2010 to correct this fairly innocuous amendment.I am worried about the timescale that is available for the Finance Bill and the very important measures contained in it while this matter is being discussed at great length.  However, because of the precedent it would set, we are determined that this precedent cannot be set.  A Cheann Comhairle, you have a particular responsibility to ensure that proposals from the Government are in order.  The proposal this morning was not in order and should not have been allowed.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating, when the Government now tries to correct it at 5 p.m.

Five minutes before the House recommenced dealing with the Bill a short time ago, I got a call to say neither would happen and that the Chief Whip would bring in a new order.  The reasoning was that if a new Bill was to be introduced, the advice of the Attorney General would have to be sought and it would have to be passed by Cabinet.  If the Cabinet is able to do that and the new Bill can be introduced at 10.30 p.m. tonight, when the current Bill is passed, we give it the opportunity to do so.  It can be done.If what the Government proposes is allowed to go through, a Cheann Comhairle, you are showing disrespect for Members.  It is up to you to protect the Members.

I ask the Ceann Comhairle to look deeply into what is happening because we are creating a very dangerous precedent by doing what we are doing here today.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I may be able to assist the House in this matter.  I am anxious to have a discussion on it on the floor of the House because there are certain matters that should be put on the record before I assist the House.First, I welcome the fact Deputy Stagg indicated — I take it he was speaking for his party in this regard — that it was an inadvertent mistake on my part that I did not say "í" at the end of the debate.  I accept his suggestion to that effect, which is most helpful.In regard to the position of the Taoiseach, he did not move anything in this House by sleight of hand this morning.  As soon as the Taoiseach received the relevant procedural advice, he brought it to the House, and it is a matter that can be brought without written notice.  It is the Standing Order of the House, subject to your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle, that an amendment of this character in the written Order of Business can be submitted by the Taoiseach.  Therefore, the Taoiseach was not acting in any sense with a sleight of hand in this matter.Leaving aside that issue, however, I accept that the Opposition parties were taken by surprise in that sense because they saw a written notice and then they saw a different proposal.  It is for that reason I have proposed we should vacate this morning's order and that it should not stand.  The Opposition Members' case, essentially, is that they were taken by surprise by it.  They also have a wider constitutional complaint which they have laid vent to but the procedure under the Constitution is that we regulate our own arrangements by Standing Order.  There is ample scope in the Standing Order to proceed in this way if we wish, again, subject to your ruling, a Cheann Comhairle.  My understanding is that we can proceed in this way.Incidentally, I say to Deputy Gilmore that we have not arrived at section 6 because sections 4 and 5 were ruled out of order.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	832	One can argue that, although I do not want to go into a procedural argument about this and want to assist the House.  It is an interesting procedural labyrinth we could spend hours exploring when we should be exploring the Finance Bill.With regard to the amendment itself, I have used the time available to have a further consideration of this amendment undertaken at my Department.  The amendment in its expressed terms is limited to the preparation of a report on a cost-benefit analysis of "tax expenditures provided for by this Act", setting out the costs of tax foregone and the benefits in terms of job creation or otherwise.  It is worth noting, that it is "tax expenditures provided for by this Act", not tax expenditures provided for more generally in previous financial legislation.The timeframe of one month is too short in terms of the capacities of my Department, and I would require three months to do it.  However, on that basis, I am prepared to consider the amendment and to accept it at this stage, although I will bring forward a Seanad proposal to extend the period to three months for the preparation of this report.  I do not believe there is any harm in the amendment, and many wider subjects were discussed with it on which neither I nor Deputy Burton gave ground.  I am happy to accept the text of the amendment, subject to the fact I will be bringing forward a recommendation.I was very reluctant to allow this matter to be dealt with at a Whips' meeting rather than on the floor of the House because the relationship between this House and Seanad Éireann on a Bill of this type is different from the relationship that would apply to most legislation.  The powers of the Seanad are circumscribed by the Constitution in regard to legislation of this type and the pre-eminence of this House is clearly acknowledged in the Constitution.  It is for that reason I would prefer this matter to be settled, as far as we can settle it, in this House at this stage.

As I understand it, the Minister is agreeing to accept this amendment pro tempore, as it were, even though he confesses to not liking it.  Nonetheless, he requires a longer timeframe of three months in which to present a report to the House.  I am certainly happy to accept that.I want to clarify one point.  In what the Minister says, is the attempt by the Chief Whip to reintroduce the order of the day withdrawn and does the order of the day stand?  If the Minister will confirm that, I will certainly accept his offer.  A calm discussion on the floor of the House could perhaps have reached this agreement some time ago.

Of course I do not wish to press that motion.  I do not know if there is a procedural capacity in the House to agree the period of three months at this stage.  That is the only issue.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 15, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"3.—The Principal Act is amended—(a) in section 238(2) by the insertion after “yearly interest of money” of  “and apart from any period payments made to a plaintiff by means of compensation or damages for any wrong or injury referred suffered by an individual in his or her person or in his or her profession”, and(b) in section 613(1)(c) after “profession” insert “, whether by once-off lump sum or by way of periodical payment””I understand an amendment was introduced to finance legislation many years ago by my colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, when Albert Reynolds was Minister for Finance in 1990.  The purpose of the amendment was to relieve such a court payment from any income tax implications.  Various parties to court proceedings, including various judges, PIAB and others, have all recommended that, in addition to single lump sums being paid, there may be occasions when it is desirable and perhaps even necessary to make partial or staggered payments of awards.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, in such a case, exactly the same exemption from income tax would apply.I was disappointed at the end of Committee Stage when this was previously discussed that the Minister of State announced his intention to appoint Mr. Justice Quirke to some kind of review body.  While the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, in saying this may have wished to have been helpful, I see no reason not to have periodic payments exempted from income tax in the same way as single court awards are exempted.  The system of exemption has worked very well up to now and I see no reason that it should not be extended to periodic payments because all of these matters are subject to court proceedings and generally are very carefully measured.  I think the Minister could have confidence that this would represent a positive step in the administration of significant awards of the courts.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	848	This amendment was encouraged by Senator Joe O'Toole who has done a lot of work in this field.  Having read the Committee Stage debate contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, Senator O'Toole was concerned that the Government was interpreting this as an attempt to move tax law ahead of general law.  Senator O'Toole has very cogently made the point that this is not such an attempt.  This amendment seeks to recognise that where a defendant agrees to pay to a plaintiff a sum of money on an annual basis, the tax provisions would not make this a prohibitively difficult option for those agreeing parties in the court.  The court already allows them to agree to such an arrangement but the difficulty is that, under existing tax law, the plaintiff would receive the money as if it were income to be subject to tax whereas the lump sum arrangement, which is the conventional arrangement, would not be subject to tax.This amendment seeks to allow something already allowed by the courts not to be obstructed by the tax code. The amendment is not seeking to break new ground or to upstage any discussions of a wider nature.  However, it is eight years since the Government adopted in principle the idea that we should facilitate annual payments instead of lump sum payments.  This is an important point to make. This amendment is simply facilitating a recognised and acceptable court agreement by removing a tax obstacle that might otherwise stand in its way.  I hope the Minister can agree to it.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and perhaps I should also sympathise with her.I support the amendment.  I am sure we all know of instances where somebody awarded a substantial claim suddenly had significantly more friends than he or she realised and within a very short time those newly formed relationships of friendship proved to be other than that and had managed to deprive the recipient of his or her award, leaving him or her in a dreadful condition after a short number of years.  My one concern, notwithstanding the tax issue that has been raised by the previous two speakers, is to ensure sufficient funds are put in place over the period of the award, whatever it may be, to meet the agreed settlement and that funds are locked in.

The Law Reform Commission recommended consideration of a payment on an annual basis because it may be of more benefit to the individual than a lump sum so why should there be two separate forms of tax treatment?  It is a reasonable amendment that Senator Joe O'Toole has framed and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on it.  It addresses a practical aspect that will ensure equality of tax treatment.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	851	The Minister for Finance is favourably disposed towards this amendment but it was the President of the High Court who asked Mr. Justice Quirke to draw up the terms of reference for a working group on such issues.  That report is due by November at the latest.  The Minister has indicated that he would prefer to wait for that report.He is, however, favourably disposed towards the idea and the suggestion made by Deputy O'Donnell about periodic payments to meet a person's needs, because there could be an overpayment or an underpayment.  I had not anticipated that a person who had suffered a catastrophic injury who got a major payment would be treated like a lottery winner by the sort of people mentioned by Deputy Morgan.In looking at all of this there should be a guide to assist the court in deciding an appropriate award under the periodic payment order.  For that reason, while we are favourably disposed towards the thinking in the amendment, we would prefer to wait for the outcome of the work of Mr. Justice Quirke.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The Minister did not respond to my point.  In the interim there are cases where those involved, the court, defendant and plaintiff, want to make an agreement of this nature and the only obstacle is the tax treatment.  If the Minister accepts that we ought to do this, why do we need to wait for a report that refers to the broader issue of changing law in this realm where we simply have cases that could be facilitated in the meantime?  Senator O'Toole has followed this closely and that is the point he is making.  The Minister will be allowing one or two cases to slip through inadvertently which could be better handled if he was willing to concede.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	853	The inconsistency across the courts is often raised by the public and in this House.  If a periodic payment order is to be used in cases of catastrophic injury, it would be important that there be a guide for the court.  For the sake of waiting until the next Finance Bill we will be able to ensure we have such a guide.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	854	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 15, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:3.—Section 531A(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is amended by the substituting of the following for the definition of "aggregate income""‘aggregate income for the year of assessment', in relation to an individual and a year of assessment, means the aggregate of the individual's relevant emoluments in the year of assessment, including relevant emoluments that are paid in whole or in part for a year of assessment other than the year of assessment during which the payment is made, and relevant income for the year of assessment, but excluding any amounts paid by an employer under section 787E(1) and section 787E(2)."This amendment provides for the tax treatment of PRSAs to be on a par with other pension provisions.  It is a reasonable request and I hope the Minister will accede to it.  It is either a yea or nay question.  PRSAs were introduced to encourage people to take their pensions more seriously where employers have not been in the habit of providing cover.  It appears to be in conflict with Government aims if the tax treatment would be disadvantageous in comparison with other pension contributions.  I am sure the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will give this amendment a particularly warm response.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	855	Wearing the hat of the Minister for Finance, I regret that I will not be able to accept this.  The levy, given that it is applied on an individual's gross income, does not grant relief for capital allowances, pension contributions and so on.  The Minister is anxious not to erode the base of the income levy.  For that reason he does not propose to accept the amendment.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	856	I am disappointed because it seemed fair and was in line with another Minister's policy who is very persuasive in her encouragement of people to take up PRSAs.  I do not intend, however, to delay the House if we cannot persuade the Government to take this on board.Deputy Barrett has drawn to my attention a similar anomaly in the treatment of approved retirement funds compared to annuities, where people have the option of certain income cover allowing them to retain their funds in ARFs where others have annuities.  Again the PRSI treatment of the two options seems different.  There should maybe be consistency in the approach.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	857	With the combined system for payments of levies, such as the health levy and PRSI, that is to be introduced in the next year, the Minister for Finance has indicated that he will look at all the anomalies that might exist.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	858	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 17, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:"(ia) for the year of assessment 2010 and subsequent years of assessment up to and including the year of assessment 2013 in respect of qualifying interest paid in respect of a qualifying loan taken out on or after 1 January 2003 and before 1 January 2004.”The Minister for Finance was sympathetic to the objective of this amendment.  Deputy Noel Ahern, who is not here, was also very supportive.  It arises from the fact that people who have reached the sixth year of their mortgage are treated as being in their seventh year and their entitlement to mortgage relief is withdrawn by the Revenue Commissioners, contrary to the normal understanding that there was to be seven years of relief.  The result is that people who have had mortgage relief will be caught out by the 1 January 2004 deadline.The Minister indicated that those who had mortgage relief would be allowed to continue to have it for a certain period.  The amendment provides that those who took out mortgages during 2003 would qualify not for the full amount proposed for those who took out their mortgages in 2004 but for a more curtailed period of relief.  House prices in 2003 were escalating rapidly and anomalies have been brought to the attention of Deputies on all sides of the House about how this has caught people who are exposed.  There is a degree of support for this on all sides.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	859	I support this amendment.  The problem is that someone could take out a mortgage on 1 January 2004 and receive a full seven years of relief, because it is based upon when a person takes it out in a particular year.  The problem is that somebody who took out a mortgage in 2003 would not get relief for that year.  In the interest of fairness, we should consider a seven year period as distinct from seven tax years.  It is a subtle but important difference for people who signed mortgages in a year when house prices were increasing at an alarming rate.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	860	Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the amendment for three reasons.  The first is that when the Department of Finance examined the matter, 2004 was found to be the peak year for house prices.  People who purchased houses in 2003 were significantly better off than purchasers in the subsequent years.  Those who bought houses in 2003 paid an average of €24,624 less than those who purchased in 2004.  In order to target resources at those who suffered most from negative equity, the year 2004 was chosen.The second reason is if the date is changed, those who purchased in the last half of 2002 will make the same argument.  While this is a good measure in terms of supporting people, there will be demands to extend it six months prior to the cut-off date.  The third reason is the loss that an extension to 2003 would cause to the Exchequer.  The amendment as proposed would cost in the region of €16 million per annum, or a total cost of €64 million.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	861	This was an imperfect attempt to deal with the issue given that we did not have access to the costings.  I suggest that the Minister could consider a couple of options.  One would be a transition arrangement involving a declining scale over a number of months so that costs could be cut dramatically.  Alternatively, the Government could simply agree to give people who are in this category one more year of mortgage cover.  They are finding they are being cut off at six years if they raised the mortgage in 2003 because of the nature of the tax year.  While the Minister is perhaps correct that the average price of a house in 2004 was €24,000 more than the price in 2003, the price of a house purchased on 1 January 2004 was probably no different from one purchased on 31 December 2003.  The argument could be reversed to ask why we treat people who are only a day apart in their house purchases so differently.  Either we could choose a transitional arrangement, which is common among the provisions introduced by the Department of Finance, or we could give an additional year to this category of people, which would be fairly simple and cheap.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I concur with my colleague.  The Minister outlined the increase from 2003 to 2004 but I would be interested in learning the change in house prices from 2002 to 2003.  We are looking for a sense of fair play in this matter.  People assumed they would receive mortgage relief over a seven year period and a transition arrangement would be fair to those who fall into the 2003 category.  The issue has been raised by quite a number of my constituents because they are genuinely under pressure.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I appreciate that people are coming under pressure and understand how we would get representations on extending the deadline but there is no doubt that 2004 was the year in which prices shot up.  The peak years were 2006 and 2007 but prices have since returned to 2004 levels.  We are discussing seven tax years rather than calendar years.  In discontinuing any tax relief, it is important to set a definite date.  People have fallen just outside the deadlines set in every scheme introduced.  While naturally one would be sympathetic to doing as much as possible for those who find themselves in negative equity, the scheme is intended to target those who suffered the most because they purchased houses in 2004.  For that reason, and because of the potential loss of income to the Exchequer, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	864	Amendment No. 10 is ruled out of order because it has a potential charge on the Exchequer.

If that creates a charge on the Exchequer, I suggest the sum involved would be very small and what would be described in my part of the world as less than pocket money.  I do not know why it is ruled out of order.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	868	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 27, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"20.—The Minister may, by regulations, and after consultation with the Minister for Health, introduce specific reliefs to help equip Primary Care Centres with appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities where he is satisfied that they bring commensurate social benefits in the more effective provision of health services.".This amendment arose from a report by the Joint Committee on Health and Children on primary care centres.  There was all-party agreement that the Minister for Finance should consider the possibility of tax reliefs to encourage the establishment of such facilities.I do not think the argument needs to be rehearsed at length but anyone who visits my part of the city would see that the lack of primary care facilities is forcing people to present to accident and emergency units in excessive numbers.  If I recall the Comptroller and Auditor General's report correctly, the average cost of an accident and emergency visit is in the order of €300.  Clearly, cost effectiveness would encourage the development of primary care centres with more diagnostic facilities and better capacity to deal with basic matters like blood tests.  At present on the north side of Dublin doctors are charging medical card holders for blood tests, which means patients must wait several months to be tested in general hospitals.  This is a very inefficient way to manage an important diagnostic tool.It is generally believed that the proposal to fund primary care centres rather than pile patients into overstretched acute hospitals deserves our support.  I framed this amendment in a way that is not overly prescriptive.  It accords with the Minister's expectation in the area of tax reliefs, namely, that the costs are commensurate with the benefits.  It also fits with general policy for the sector, in other words, the Department of Health and Children would accept it as a coherent way of delivering health services.This amendment would at least enable the Minister for Finance to consider the report of the joint committee and if he and the Minister for Health and Children agree with it, he would have the statutory power to progress it.  They may not agree to it after considering the issues.  The Minister is under no obligation in this amendment.  Given the state of thinking about the matter, I believe the amendment would give the Minister a weapon in his toolbox which, hopefully, he could use if it is seen as a good way to develop health policy.  He is protected by his right to ask the Department of Health and Children to do the necessary cost benefits and then revert and show and convince him it is a good way to spend public money.We all realise that whether it is a tax relief or a spending item, taxpayers' money is at stake.  I did not draw the amendment so widely that it would support mortgages and property development.  I realise there would be a degree of unease about mortgage-based tax reliefs given their history.  That does not apply in the case of diagnostics and treatment and it may be a way of facilitating a better social policy that appears to command support across the House.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	869	I support the amendment on the basis of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children report on primary care published last month.  There is a view that the primary care strategy will be vital in terms of health care provision in the future.  The Labour Party believes primary care centres should be licensed by the HSE and subject to the rules of HIQA.  If one adheres to the goals in the primary care strategy, one would encourage more people to be treated in primary care centres and moved away from accident and emergency centres.  If more people are to be treated in primary care centres, then it is obvious that we need more such centres and, therefore, one must provide some degree of stimulus to bring about more of them.I am aware of one such centre in north Cork which will bring together approximately 17 general practitioners.  The HSE has bought in as an active stakeholder in that process and the PCCC, primary, community and continuing care, programme will arise from the process.  There are beneficial social outcomes as a result of facilitating specific reliefs by regulation.I anticipate the Minister will speak to the issue of property-based reliefs and there is general agreement in respect of their future.  However, specific reliefs can be made in respect of capital investment or equipment.  We must be far-reaching in this regard.  I admire the wording put forward because it allows the Minister a degree of latitude.  We should consider the amendment laterally and take a lateral view of how we proceed with primary care centres, which the amendment facilitates.

Simply put, it is Government policy to promote primary care centres.  We all believe they are a good idea.  One must ensure proper levels of service and equipment are available, which are very costly.  This amendment would allow the Minister to consider the matter with the Minister for Health and Children to determine what measures could be put in place to enable the proper roll-out of primary care centres nationally.  There are continuing difficulties within our hospitals which are under-staffed and under-resourced.  Primary care centres must not fall into that situation.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton is clear, concise and affords the Minister latitude to examine the issue.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I also admire Deputy Bruton's wording because it links the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and many other considerations and consultations.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The report was only presented to the Minister of Health and Children last month.  She will consider it and then advise us on the matter.  A suite of measures is considered in the report.  The Minister for Finance is of the view that no one thing should be taken in isolation and he will wait for the recommendations of the Minister for Health and Children as well.  I accept what Deputies have said about the importance of such centres and the impact they could have on reducing waiting lists, etc., for accident and emergency departments.  However, at present some 200 primary care centres are under consideration for leasing arrangements.  In the case of 90 of these, contract negotiations are under way and, in turn, approximately 30 of these are expected to open this year.  The key issue is not in respect of the number but the fact that each of these developments benefits from Exchequer funding already.  Any suggestion to further supplement the contribution of the Exchequer would have to be very compelling since the centres are already being supported.  Deputy Sherlock referred to the property-based tax incentives.  Even in this Finance Bill the property-based tax incentives for child care facilities have been removed and it is the intention to support new or further incentives.Another issue of relevance relates to the equipment doctors use.  I understand that if equipment is used for diagnostic or treatment purposes, which are the words used in the amendment, it comes in under plant and machinery.  Equipment used in such centres will qualify for capital allowance at 12.5% per annum over eight years.  Given that the Exchequer is funding each of the centres in some way or another and because capital allowances are available for the equipment for doctors, etc., the Minister for Finance is not keen to grant any further reliefs at this stage.  Obviously, we must await the recommendation of the Minister for Health and Children also.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	876	I have no wish to hold up the House but, if I am correct, the Minister for Health launched a health strategy in 2001 in which he indicated that he wished to see 600 primary health care centres established.  This was a core principle and one of the priorities of his health strategy to reduce the reliance on hospital services.  The phraseology used was that this would be the vision for the future.  A glitzy launch took place and Dublin Castle was hired for the day.  It was flagged that there would be up to ten or 15 of these primary care centres in every constituency and one was led to believe that it was a very encouraging and positive development in the health service.  Some nine years later we are led to believe by the Minster that there are only a handful of such centres in place but a further 200 are under consideration.  This does not suggest the existing policy of the HSE has been spectacularly successful in rolling out a key objective of the Government's health strategy.While we should wait to hear what the Minister for Health and Children has to say on the topic by all means, I do not see why we could not take some legislative power to determine if this could be encouraged by suitable tax reliefs.  I believe the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance agree that they should have this weapon available for use.  Either this is a genuine contribution to health economics and we are getting better value for the taxpayers' buck by having primary health care centres or it is not.  The HSE has had nine years to prove the success of its strategy and it appears to have been singularly unsuccessful to date.  While I am not a fan of tax reliefs for every Tom, Dick and Harry's project, there is a genuine case to be made that this measure could bring about more cost-effective care.I acknowledge the point made by the Minister that one could get 12.5% tax relief if one were set up as a company.  I am unsure if a sole trader would get the same relief, although I am informed by my accountant beside me that is the case.There is a case for doing something to kick-start this.  It is surprising that the Minister for Health and Children would be keen to promote this in an area where I consider it is wholly inappropriate, namely private hospitals on the grounds of public facilities, whereas an area that has been the bedrock of the healthy strategy of the party of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for nine years is not touched and nothing was done to kick-start it.  I would have thought we would better forgetting about the building of private hospitals and seeing could we leverage some private investment in this area where, traditionally, people have been satisfied with GP services privately provided.  It is one of the successful parts of the health service where, generally speaking, public and private patients get access to care on an equitable and fair basis, even though some are paying and some are not.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	877	May I tease out the figures that the Minister placed before us and seek a clarification on the number of contracts that are under negotiation presently?  I may have misheard the Minister.  I thought she stated 30 are under negotiation.  I want to get a more qualitative analysis of the present state of negotiations.  The reason I ask that is because I believe it is pertinent to the amendment.The current state of negotiations could be influenced by whether or not further stimulus is given to primary care centres that may be under negotiation presently or that persons may be thinking of setting up where they may have started cursory negotiations with the HSE or the Department of Health and Children.  Given the present state of the economy, the state of those negotiations will be predicated on whether there is a stimulus provided and an amendment such as this will definitely have an influence in bringing more of them to fruition.  That would be my party's view.

It is not prescriptive.  Effectively, it allows that consultation would take place.A measure that could be considered is that of giving accelerated capital allowances to persons to set up primary care centres, a matter touched on by Deputy Bruton.  It would be probably universally agreed that GPs provide a very good service in the community in terms of the overall health service.The amendment seeks to provide for a form of specialist service within each area of the country, but it is being promoted in terms of the private sector.  This would ensure that all issues were looked at and it would be put into a legislative basis, in other words, there would be back-up in legislation in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, would comment on the issue of accelerated capital allowances to ensure, along with what Deputy Sherlock stated, that this issue of the provision of primary care centres would move along at pace.  The provision of private hospitals on public lands is very much open to question and this would be a better use of taxpayers' money.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The provision both of private hospitals on public lands and primary care centres are not incompatible.  A primary care centre is designed to stop people ending up in hospital and we all would appreciate the value of having more primary care centres.In response to Deputy Sherlock, the figures I gave relate to those that are under leasing consideration at present.  The HSE is using a range of different approaches, including direct capital expenditure on building, refurbishing or extending the units around the country.  Separate to that, there are leasing arrangements under consideration.  In those figures, 200 are under consideration for leasing arrangements.  In fact, 95 are in contract negotiations at present.  It is expected that 30 of those involving such leasing would open this year, which would be over and above anything that might be done through direct capital expenditure by the HSE.As I indicated earlier, it is not intended to do anything else on the property-based tax schemes.  Deputy Bruton stated that the amendment is only asking that the Minister for Health and Children would negotiate as well, but one would not want to delay any action that might take place by stating that we will wait to hear the view of the Minister for Health and Children, who might recommend incentives, etc., because it would be important to get these centres up and running.  Having 200 of them under active consideration for leasing, over and above what has already been provided for, is not a bad record.  For the same reasons I outlined at the beginning, I will not accept this amendment.

In page 29, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"23.—That the Minister will consider making available designated tax incentives for the Limerick regeneration project as already recommended in the Limerick regeneration masterplan and Mid-West task force report.".This amendment, which I brought forward on Committee Stage, relates to the specific circumstances of the regeneration in Limerick in the constituency I represent.  The Minister gave an undertaking that it would be considered as part of a first-phase submission implementation plan to be submitted by the end of this month to the Limerick regeneration project.We have spoken on a number of occasions so far in the debate on the issue of tax incentive schemes and I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the amendment on the review of schemes put forward by Deputy Burton.  What I propose here relates to the Limerick regeneration project that was launched by the Government on foot of Mr. John Fitzgerald's report, which was completed in March 2007.  Following from that report, a vision document was produced and launched in January 2008 by President Mary McAleese in Limerick.  Subsequently, a detailed master plan was produced and presented to the Cabinet in October 2008.  The vision document has been agreed by the Cabinet; the master plan has not.The Minister made reference to 2004 being the year when house prices ballooned out of control.  One of the reasons for that was the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated that the fundamentals were fine and people should build on.  Houses were built and the great majority of those who bought houses at that time are now in negative equity.However, within the Limerick regeneration project, houses need to be built.  Over 400 houses have been knocked in the four areas of Moyross and St. Mary's Park on the northside of the city and Ballinacurra Weston and Southill on the southside.  Many of these houses are in areas where elderly people and young families live.This would give an impetus to the project.  There still is a requirement for the State to provide investment.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, during Committee Stage gave a commitment that it would be looked at as part of the submission to be made at the end of this month, but I also want to see the overall master plan agreed by the Cabinet.  The Minister will be well aware that when this issue arose with the Fitzgerald report in March 2007, it was deemed to be of such critical importance that it fell under the remit, not of a specific line Minister but of the Cabinet.  The first phase of the regeneration plan will go directly to the Cabinet for approval.I welcome the examination of the tax designation areas.  I believe it should be specific to the regeneration areas in Limerick because the unemployment rate there is five times higher than the national average.  Up to 22,000 people are on the live register, 16,000 of whom live in the city alone.This measure would provide the stimulus to get the private sector involved in the regeneration programme.  However, there must be State funding up front to show the Government is committed to the project.Houses need to be built at this stage.  Elderly people are watching the houses around them being knocked or boarded up.  What is needed is hope.  This amendment on the tax designation would be self-financing for the State.  For every €1 spent by the State in the building projects, 35 cent would go back into the State coffers.I acknowledge the commitment made by the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage to consider this proposal with the first phase submission to be made by the Limerick regeneration project at the end of March.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The Government remains firmly committed to the Limerick regeneration programme, as was reiterated at the end of 2009.  The work that has already been done is beginning to have an effect, which Deputy O'Donnell acknowledges.  It can be seen not just in the demolition work, but also the investment in Garda resources, education, youth training and health services.  This is just as important as any capital moneys allocated.  Since the initiative started in mid-2007, up to €50 million has gone into the project.  This year, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has committed another €25 million.Having said that, I accept people need to see positive new developments through growth in new housing, for example.  The Government asked the Limerick regeneration agencies to complete their work on the programme and prepare a phase one implementation plan by the end of the first quarter in 2010, at which point the Government will consider the matter again.While I do not propose to accept the amendment, the Government remains committed to the whole Limerick regeneration master plan.

Is there any capital aspect to the €50 million given to the project to date?  Was it designated mainly for the demolition of unfit houses?I acknowledge the resources put into policing, education and social work with great community activists working in the areas.  However, it has only been demolition to date with no construction of new housing units.  People need to see the building projects begin.This year, the Government has provided capital funding for regeneration projects in Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston.  However, my main concern, and that of many people in Limerick, is that unless the master plan is agreed, there will be no firm commitment on works projects for the following years.  As these are meant to be done incrementally over the next ten to 15 years, we want the Government to commit to the whole project over this time.I welcome the Minister's decision to take on board tax incentives for the regeneration areas on foot of the submission to be made by the regeneration agencies at the end of March.  Will the Government approve the overall master plan when it receives the first phase implementation plan?

From the beginning, it was envisaged in implementing the Limerick regeneration plan that half of the €1.7 billion needed over ten years would come from the private sector.  However, there needs to be some incentive for the private sector to become involved in the project.  All Members from Limerick will have had approaches from investors who would be interested in developing in the regeneration areas.  It is to be hoped that local people in the Limerick area would also invest and develop projects in these areas.  In the current economic climate, these hopes are receding rapidly unless some incentives for this to happen are provided.As Deputy O'Donnell said, we need to know this project will be completed.  It is a large project and so far we have only had the negative side of it with buildings knocked and vacated.  In some cases, the areas in question are worse than they were before because no new housing stock has replaced them.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that the Cabinet will give full backing to the plan with the commitment to see it through to the finish?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I, too, support the amendment.  Well thought-out and well-focused tax incentives could bring significant opportunities to Limerick and the mid-west.  It is also important, as the regeneration project seems to have hit the rocks, that the Government demonstrates it has some commitment to developing Limerick and offers some hope to the people of that city which has suffered immensely over recent years.I hope the Minister will accept the amendment as it simply requests the Government to consider the tax incentive.  Of course, we hope it will not just consider but implement the incentives.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	887	I support this amendment.  I do so with an element of care because some tax designation measures of recent times have been overdone and overcooked.  This, however, is rather a special case for all of the reasons the House well understands.  I am not sure I understand the Minister's reply.   The last public utterance on this came from the Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Dea, before his defenestration at his own hand when he said the State could not keep its end of the bargain but that he had on tap a number of private investors waiting to move in and fill the gap.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, in the only instance of that I have picked up on, the private investor concerned is contingent on something along those lines being put in place.  I am sure the Minister agrees with Deputies Bruton and O'Sullivan that we cannot leave this in the mess it is in now until six or seven years down the road when the economy starts to pick up again.  I would like to hear the Minister set out her plans if she is not prepared to take on board the amendment before the House.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	888	As I understand it, the agencies are developing the implementation plan and it will include projected costings, planning and value for money considerations.  The economic development options and whatever opportunities or incentives are needed to attract the essential private investment to which Deputy Rabbitte refers are also under examination.  The Government reaffirmed its commitment to the project at the end of last year but has asked that the first phase of implementation plan be presented very quickly, within the first quarter of this year.  The Government will then seriously consider it.Deputy O'Donnell mentioned housing plans.  The sheltered housing projects at Moyross and Ballinacurra Weston are expected to go to tender this year.  That will represent real progress of new positive development rather than just demolition.  The projects at Southill and St. Mary's Park have also been developed.  While I do not accept the amendment, nor am I in a position to, the Government is still strongly committed to the project.  It will give active consideration to the first phase of the implementation plan and its recommendations.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	889	I thank my colleagues for accepting the amendment I have tabled.  The opportunity cost to the State by providing for tax designation is very little.  In the current climate we must encourage private investment.  This project was effectively split, with €1.7 billion from the State and €1.4 billion from private investors.  The employment opportunities mean this is effectively a fiscal stimulus for Limerick besides the fact it will improve the lives of those living in the regeneration areas.  This is about long-term commitment and we cannot have a situation where the Government arrives in a cavalcade and announces it will knock the area and fully rebuild it and then knocks 400 houses in areas in worse condition than before regeneration was announced.  I am not denying the work done in social areas but I refer to the physical aspect.  There is an employment opportunity of up to 3,000 jobs at full construction stage.  Some 4,000 jobs can be created if the whole regeneration project is under way.The Minister is avoiding one of the key elements.  I take on board the point that the tax designation element will be included in the implementation phase.  This was also included in the master plan.  The Government fudged the issue of endorsement.  The Government endorsed a vision plan but did not endorse the master plan.  The master plan sets out what will happen over a ten-year period.  It details the number of houses to be built and the number of projects to be completed.  When will the Government approve the master plan?  Will it approve it at the end of March along with the first phase in order to give certainty to people in the regeneration areas and those in the wider Limerick area that the project will come to fruition?  The Government appears to operate in an all or nothing fashion.  Either it throws millions at a situation or gives nothing.  Why not be strategic and give a commitment that the project will be completed within ten or 15 years, while giving multiannual funding?  We all know the cost of construction has reduced by approximately 35%.  The Government should endorse the master plan and make it Government policy at Cabinet level.  Will the Government do so at the end of March along with the first phase of the implementation plan?The Government should consider the tax incentives.  People in the regeneration areas of Moyross, St. Mary's Park, Southill, Ballinacurra Weston and the wider Limerick area will know the regeneration project has been started will be completed.  People need to see the physical build.  They need to see homes rebuilt and refurbished.  That is up in the air at the moment and this is unacceptable.  Will the Government agree to the master plan at the end of March?

The Government has already reaffirmed its commitment.  Some €1.65 billion was set out as public investment in the plan.  Let us consider the implementation plan, which will give us the first start for the Government to consider the project.  Undoubtedly the Government remains committed to the vision and the plan but I will not accept the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Donnell.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 29, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:"(a) by inserting the following subsection in section 207:"(4A) A charity—(a) shall submit a copy of its annual report and accounts to the Revenue Commissioners within six months of the end of its account year, which shall be for a period not exceeding twelve months,(b) shall publish their accounts and annual report in a public place or on the approved body’s website within four months of the end of its account year,(c) shall provide the Revenue Commissioners with a statement confirming compliance with paragraph (b) signed by the treasurer, trustee or any duly authorised agent.”,(b) by inserting the following in section 847A:"(13A) Every approved sports body—(a) shall deliver to the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners within six months of the end of its account year, which shall be for a period not exceeding twelve months, a return containing particulars of the aggregate amount of the relevant donations received by the body in respect of the approved project,(b) shall publish a copy of this return in a public place or on the approved body’s website within four months of the end of its account year,(c) shall provide the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners with a statement confirming that the relevant donations received by the body in respect of the approved project were expended on the approved project only. This statement will be signed by the treasurer, trustee or any duly authorised agent.”.”.The purpose of this amendment is to amend sections 207, 208 and 235, together with section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The Revenue Commissioners publish lists of bodies whose income is exempt.  Under the first section there are charity bodies whose income is exempt and under the latter there are sporting bodies whose income is exempt.  Some of these publish their accounts very clearly but they are not submitted to the Revenue Commissioners unless requested.  I accept that some are very transparent.  The purpose of this amendment is to require that all such bodies make public their accounts.  Examples of how to do this are provided by organisations such as Concern and the GAA.  The amendment also requires them to submit their accounts and annual report to the Revenue Commissioners within six months of the end of the financial year.  That is a reasonable request.  The amendment also deals with the tax relief available on donations to approved projects by sporting bodies and charities.  Previously, such relief on donations was restricted to Third World bodies.  However, that is no longer the case as the list has been extended in respect of approved charities and capital projects for sporting purposes.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure there is an obligation to publish a separate analysis of the money received under the donation schemes in respect of sport schemes, as in respect of specific capital schemes.I anticipate that the Minister may say that some of this is already provided for in the charities legislation.  However, as I understand it, the charities legislation in this regard has not been invoked and there is no indication this will happen.  The purpose of this amendment is to pick up on this area in the interim.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	896	I wish to piggy back on Deputy Rabbitte's amendment to discuss the points raised in my amendments Nos. 15 and 16 which have been ruled out of order as they do not arise out of committee proceedings.  I understand that some of those involved in charities believe the sections on charities, as drafted in the Bill, could be excessively onerous on trustees and others involved in charities.  That is the context in which amendments Nos. 15 and 16, which sadly are out of order, were put to me.  Perhaps the Minister might have access to a note from officials that could be put on the record and would advise charities that their fears are unfounded or that the matter is under consideration for the future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	897	Deputy Rabbitte was correct to assume that I would refer to the Charities Act 2009.  As I understand it, the issue raised in the amendment is provided for in that Act, albeit not yet implemented.  The view is that there is not much point in replicating those powers in separate legislation.  Having said that, the Revenue Commissioners play an important role in terms of putting in place controls and monitoring procedures and so on.  We must get the balance right in terms of putting in place provisions which are not too onerous on trustees and of ensuring the public knows whether it is dealing with a bona fide charity.  The Revenue Commissioners have a monitoring role in this regard.The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism deals with sporting areas in respect of the Charities Act.  I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.  Perhaps Deputy Bruton would reiterate the point he wished me to address.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	898	My amendments Nos. 15 and 16 have unfortunately been ruled out of order.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	899	The note I have states that the power provided for in section 208(b)(v) to appoint an auditor is only intended to be used where the Revenue Commissioners are not satisfied with information provided to them or where the appointment of an auditor is deemed necessary by them.  There is no question of Revenue always appointing an auditor to verify information provided.  The operative word in this regard is that the Revenue Commissioners “may” appoint rather than “shall” appoint an auditor.  I hope this allays the concerns expressed.

I am not quite sure that that is true in all respects.  Why is the legislation not being implemented?  Is it that the Revenue Commissioners have such work to do they are not yet ready to put in place that which is envisaged by the legislation?  I would not be advancing this amendment if the legislation passed by the House were implemented.  Perhaps the Minister will say when we can expect that legislation to be implemented.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	903	Like other speakers, I have sympathy for genuine charities who are trying to manage their affairs honourably, fairly and justly.  It is important we provide as much space as possible to allow them to get on with their difficult work.Deputy Burton referred on Committee Stage to sharks, not of the marine type, who might be seeking a loophole in this provision for their own benefit.  None of us wants to see that happen.  I believe Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would have tightened up the legislation sufficiently to ensure the sharks could not get through. However, we must not tighten it to an extent that makes the task of charities getting on with their laudable business onerous.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I am anxious to allay any fears trustees might have.  It is certainly not the Government's intention to make their task more onerous or to implement legislation that would prevent people becoming involved in charities as trustees.  I take this opportunity to reassure people that the intention is that that part of the Act will be used judiciously.  It will be of assistance in situations where the Revenue Commissioners are unable to carry out a review of a charitable body in the normal way, for example, where such a body is located abroad.  It is not intended that such power will be used regularly.Deputy Rabbitte referred to the Charities Act.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is rolling out an implementation plan for the Charities Act 2009.  I understand it has taken a number of years to be implemented in other countries.  That will probably be the case here too.  Some sections of it have already commenced, including regulation of the sale of presigned mass cards.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	910	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 34, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"25.—Section 644AB and 649B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 shall not apply where a change in the zoning of lands was contained in a draft development plan or a draft local area plan published prior to 30 October 2009 and adopted after 30 October 2009.  The zoning of lands in the draft development plan or a draft local area plan published prior to 30 October 2009 and adopted after 30 October 2009 shall be deemed to be the actual zoning of the land on 30 October 2009 for the purposes of Section 644AB and 649B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.".This amendment deals with a special case which affects one of the few historical places remaining in this country, namely, Westport House estate.  There are only about seven of these estates in the country.  A master plan for this estate was drawn up with the agreement of the town council and county council.  This was something for which I and other members of the council had been asking for 20 years.  A massive amount of money was borrowed and a professional team has been employed to deal with every aspect of the plan.  The owners of the estate borrowed a lot of money to get a professional team to deal with every aspect of the plan.This 80% windfall tax was really put in place to penalise developers and not to penalise people like Lord Altamont.  The Browne family have had this estate in their name for many years.  They want to develop that estate, as do the people of Westport.  This estate attracts over 50,000 visitors every year and it has done more for tourism in the west of Ireland than Bord Fáilte and Ireland West Tourism.  We had been encouraging the council to sit down with Lord Altamont to try to develop this plan.  Now that we have the plan and we have brought Lord Altamont on board, this tax is brought in.  I ask for an exemption for this plan.  The council is in favour of it and I want an exemption for Westport House and estates like it.  There are only seven or eight such estates in the country.Whatever money is needed to pay for the development of the estate will be spent on the windfall tax, and so the estate will not be developed.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment because it will only affect a few estates.  The Government can go ahead with the developer aspect of the tax, although I believe it is wrong as well.  The Green Party wants to do this but it will not be good in the long term for the development of lands.  However, I am asking the Minister to exempt Westport House and estates like it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	911	I have a very long note on 80% draft development plans and so on.  I was not aware that Deputy Ring would raise the specific issue of Westport House.  Notwithstanding that, I do not intend to accept the amendments.  Westport House as a heritage site is not an isolated case.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated there is a number of places to be rezoned from non-development land use to development land use.I am advised that because it is not an isolated case, there is no requirement to inform the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about a local area plan if it relates to an area of the population lower than 2,000.  There may well be more than 50 local area plans in draft form at any one time.  As it is not an isolated case — I am not sure we should be legislating for one place anyway — I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	912	I want to push this to a vote because the Government is making a mistake on it.  The Bill is not dealing with our problem.  There should be some exemption and the officials should be able to get some exemption on heritage sites.  It was part of an area plan, and the people there believe that they should be exempt.  The only thing creating the problem is this aspect of the Bill.  Even if the Bill has to go back to the Seanad, I ask the officials to look at this to try to exempt places like this.  The tax was set up for developers and not for heritage sites.This is a heritage site and a fabulous house.  The town council, the county council and the people of Westport and Mayo have been looking for this development for 20 years.  Now that we have got Lord Altamont and the Browne family to agree, they have worked with the council, the county planners and the town planners, and they have borrowed substantial money to bring this to the best standard possible.  Is there anything that could be done to allow this exemption?  It is wrong to penalise this development, and the money they have borrowed for the plan will instead be spent on the windfall tax.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	913	This proposal was never debated in the House.  It was brought in by way of a Report Stage amendment to the NAMA legislation.  It was guillotined in such a way that the House never got an opportunity to debate it in any shape or form.  Deputy Ring and others should have had an opportunity to debate this penal rate of tax.  It was done on the understanding that nothing would be affected by the tax, that there would be no more development and so this was a fanciful tax as nobody was going to rezone land.  The place was awash with rezoned land, so it was designed as a token to say that we are going to shut the door and lock it with 80 locks so that it will never be opened again.This provision was never debated in the House.  People like Deputy Ring would have known of specific cases that should have been contemplated before the House decided on this, but they were not given that opportunity.  It is very unfair that the Minister puts up a stone wall and states we cannot consider it.The consequences of this tax were not thought through.  There was no assessment done in the Department of Finance before it arrived on the statute books.  It was never debated in the Dáil.  We read criticism today about parliamentary accountability having disappeared, and the highest constitutionally independent officer in the land, the Ombudsman, has told us that we need to get our act together.  This is a case in point.  It is ridiculous to expect people to live with the consequences of a tax that was dreamed up by a handful of people in a particular party who wanted a token green fig leaf to cover their nakedness in respect of decisions being made on other matters, namely, NAMA.  However, other people have to live with the consequences of this fig leaf.  We need a proper system of enacting legislation.  It cannot be done on a whim and without scrutiny.Perhaps the 80% windfall tax is a good thing but I cannot think of an activity that necessitated an 80% tax, unless those who propose it want to ban that activity.  I do not know where this came from because we were never exposed to the thinking of the Green Party, who no doubt advocated it.  It would be nice if some of its members were here to respond to Deputy Ring, because we have seen what could be the first of many consequences of an ill-thought out tax.  We have learned the lesson so often that we, as the saying goes, "marry in haste, repent at leisure", when Bills were jackbooted through the House only to be later found unworkable.This provision should never have passed through the House without scrutiny and there should have been an opportunity for people like Deputy Ring or Lord Altamont to have a case heard by the Oireachtas before decisions were made.  The Minister now feels obliged to cling to the wreckage of this idea because she does not have a mandate from the Cabinet to change it.  We should find some way of dealing with the fallout — be it through a special provision, regulation or otherwise — from such an extraordinary tax and the way it was conceived and delivered.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	914	Seeking an exemption for one particular development is not the way to make law, and I have sympathy with the Minister on that.  However, I know what Deputy Ring is talking about as I visited Westport House last summer.  He is right about the focus it provides for the attraction of business in Westport and west Mayo in general.  Given what he is confronting, how else is he to address the issue?When the former Senator, Déirdre de Búrca, decided to hang up her boots she said that Fianna Fáil was running rings around the Green Party.  This is a perfect example of what she had in mind because the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, knows that her backbenchers broke up in uncontrollable laughter when this measure was introduced.  As far as they are concerned, it has no application.  If there was a windfall tax during the height of the boom — albeit 80% is a generous one — one could see the point of it.  I can see the point of it but the problem is the manner in which this has been done, the way it has been pitched, the fact that it has not been subjected to any discussion and that it is generally considered by the business community to have no relevance whatsoever because it simply does not arise, yet it has the implications Deputy Ring highlighted for a meritorious project in terms of attracting euro and other denominations from outside the State.The Minister ought to be able to give Deputy Ring a more meaningful reply than saying we cannot legislate for this, and tough luck.  Where there is the prospect of generating some economic activity and maintaining some local employment, we cannot afford to turn our backs on a project such as this one.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	915	I have sympathy for the Minister having to take this part of Report Stage effectively under another Minister's portfolio.  There is a complex implication here because the amendment refers to the draft development plan or local area plan, which is what the legislation refers to also, but is a contravention of a county development plan, for example, included or excluded?  That type of minutiae that Members here will be familiar with was not teased out at the time.  The only reason this measure was introduced, and I agree with previous speakers in this regard, was because of bluff, bluster and spin from the Green Party Members which allowed them pretend to their own members, and perhaps some gullible members of the public who might fall for it, that they were achieving something when in fact they were not.I will give the Minister a brief example.  When I was a member of a local authority I had occasion to examine category 2 development plans and in one instance an old farmer owned land that stretched almost to the centre of this category 2 development plan area, which was a largely rural area.  While he was alive that old farmer would never part with that land for any purpose other than agriculture.  He was never going to allow it be developed for building purposes for any reason or for any amount of money.  There was not the remotest chance of that yet that land was rezoned for housing purposes.  If that case applied now that farmer would be pursued for 80% of the value of the property and he would not have the funds.  Would he, therefore, lose his entire farm?Certain exclusions and subtleties that needed to be dealt with in the circumstances were not dealt with.  As Deputy Bruton rightly pointed out, this debate was, as usual, placed under guillotine and we did not have time to tease out these matters and point out the significant difficulties involved.If we want to deal with the question of heritage sites throughout the country, and I am sure we do, this legislation must be reviewed urgently.  I do not know that it can be done as quickly as Deputy Ring would wish.  I would prefer if it could be, and would support that, but it must come back before this House for scrutiny to give it proper shape, rather than this mad, Green Party spin idea to rush it through and let others pick up the price for it.

From a practical viewpoint it is reasonable that the Minister would introduce an amendment in the Seanad debate to deal specifically with heritage sites.  This is a site that is open to the public but it will probably be impossible to properly develop it without this measure and would have been examined in the context that the 80% windfall tax would not have applied.  Surely it would be possible that the Minister could examine this from the point of view of dealing with heritage sites that are open to the public to ensure they would be exempted from the 80% windfall tax.The issue of the windfall tax was dealt with in one of the last amendments but we never got an opportunity to discuss it at any stage.  It was tabled on Report Stage.  Brownfield sites are another example.  The Minister might consider examining this issue before the Seanad debate.  We are concerned here with developing facilities that are open to the public yet the Minister is putting what is effectively a barrier in place for this sort of development to take place.I ask the Minister to accept the points on which I am sure Deputy Ring will conclude and examine this issue in a practical way in terms of heritage sites and other such sites.  We may have had an opportunity to discuss it in great depth if the debate on that amendment had not been guillotined.

The Department examined the development plan in question in regard to Westport and as Deputy Ring will be well aware, there are lands other than the heritage site which are also proposed to be rezoned from non-development land to development land.  We are not only concerned here with an individual site.Regarding the date of application, which is 30 October 2009, and rezonings made after that, if we introduced this amendment it would impact on 18 draft development plans and 50 local area plans.  We are not talking about an isolated incident in this case.  I also understand that if we were to make the exemption just for heritage sites it may be difficult to defend legally.  I am aware Deputy Bruton raised all of these issues on Committee Stage.I understand also there are three different criteria for the windfall tax: rezonings made after 30 October; an increase in the land valuation related to the rezoning; and land sold after 30 October 2009.  Given the current depressed property market, all those conditions may not occur but they may be relevant——

It would ensure that we would not have an overheated speculative market in the future but it may not be relevant today, as the two Mayo men have pointed out.  Not all of any increase in the value of land could be pointed towards the actual rezoning and therefore it would not all be subject to the 80% tax rate.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	925	I thank all the speakers who supported this amendment.  I know the Minister is not talking about the actual site but it is all part of the one estate.  I want to put on the record of the Dáil that they got legal advice and that they believed the rezoning of the Westwood estate was the same in the adopted development plan as it appears in the draft development plan.The Minister is correct.  They were not talking about the house itself but the entire grounds.  The problem, however, is that some of the ground needs to be sold to keep the house.  That has been the Green Party's plan in regard to the 80% windfall tax and it is the same party that is lecturing me, Deputy Rabbitte and every Member in this House about saving our heritage sites.  The Green Party now has an opportunity to do something about a site that everybody, including the Westport people, town council and county council, has been encouraging Lord Altamont to develop further for the past 50 years.Only seven or eight heritage houses are left in the country.  The others have all been bought by private developers and developed.  Westport House is open to the public and it is a major tourist attraction in the town of Westport.  I was a member of the town council and the county council.  The council, perhaps for historical reasons, never wanted to deal with Lord Altamont.  I suppose the Minister's party had a part to play in it.  Lord Altamont was a better Westport man than most others in the town.  He loved the town and was born and reared there, as were his daughters.  He did more for tourism in the Westport area than Bord Fáilte, Ireland West Tourism and the State ever did but got very little grant aid.  Westport House is a lovely stately home and is open to the public.I ask the Minister to make an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad covering the heritage site and grounds to try to deal with this issue.  Such heritage sites, even if they number only 16 or 17, are worth preserving.  This is what I believed the Green Party was fighting for.  I should not be fighting for this.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, should be here supporting me this evening and saying I am a great man to be advocating the preservation of heritage sites.  Instead, he is trying to close down one of the few we have left.  It does not make sense.  I ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to do something for the man.  We want the site developed and to keep the tourist attraction in Westport.  I ask the Minister to make an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	926	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 36, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:"26.—(1) Section 372AW of the Principal Act is amended—(a) in subsection (1) in the definition of “qualifying period” by substituting “31 May 2015” for “31 May 2013”, and(b) in subsection (2)(b) by substituting “4 years” for “2 years”.(2) Subsection (1) comes into operation on the making of an order to that effect by the Minister for Finance.”.This new section makes changes to the scheme of capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred in the construction or refurbishment of tourism facilities in the mid-Shannon area.  The scheme commenced on 1 June 2008 and was time limited.  Under the existing legislation governing the scheme, projects wishing to avail of relief must apply for approval in principle by 31 May 2010 in advance of expenditure being incurred.  If approved, the qualifying expenditure must then be incurred by 31 May 2013.I have been advised by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Mid Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board and Fáilte Ireland that there are a number of significant and worthwhile projects in the pipeline that have not yet been submitted formally to the board for approval.  These projects are unlikely to proceed without an extension to the existing deadline for the submission of projects.  To facilitate these projects, the Minister for Finance is making two changes to section 372AW of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  First, he is to extend the period during which applications for approval in principle can be made from two years to four years.  The latest date for the submission of such applications will be 31 May 2012.  Second, to cater for any projects that may avail of this new date for the submission of applications for approval in principle, the Minister is extending the period within which qualifying expenditure must be incurred by two years.  This period will now end on 31 May 2015.  These extensions will have to be notified to the EU Commission in the context of State aid and will, therefore, not come into operation until the necessary approval is received to make the commencement order.I do not expect that the further two-year extension of the project approval deadline will have significant short-term Exchequer implications due to the long lead-in period for the projects concerned.  Any longer-term Exchequer cost will be balanced by the benefits of additional tourism infrastructure in the area, increases in both short-term construction employment and longer-term employment in the facilities following completion.  On balance, notwithstanding the current Exchequer difficulties, there is a good case for extending the approval deadline.  I commend the amendment to the House.

With regard to developing the River Shannon, there is a strong argument for extending the scheme to Limerick.  The report of the Mid West Task Force, chaired by Mr. Denis Brosnan, recommended that the extension of the scheme be considered.  The Minister can see the benefits of such a scheme for the Shannon region.  The regeneration project falls into this category.  It is a question of developing the Shannon region, attracting tourists thereto and providing the necessary infrastructure.We all want proper cost-benefit analyses and tax incentive schemes, which are critical in certain cases.  With regard to developing the Shannon region, I ask the Minister to take on board what Mr. Brosnan's report stated on extending the scheme down the Shannon into Limerick.  I would like to hear her observations.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	928	In an earlier contribution, abuses of the incentives were referred to.  I agree entirely on this matter.  When we consider the Limerick and mid-Shannon areas and Leitrim and Roscommon, we see there are huge opportunities for tourism development.  When we consider the opportunities that exist for entrepreneurs, farmers and residents to develop an income for themselves and become sustainable, we note opportunities are few and far between.  This is why I support the Minister's amendment.  I hope the scheme can be extended beyond the mid-Shannon area.  Visitor statistics show that Leitrim and Roscommon are at the very bottom of the pile, below even Donegal and Sligo.  One way to address this is to develop incentives covering the area north and south of the mid-Shannon, including the Limerick area, as referred to by Deputy O'Donnell.  I submit strongly that the Minister consider Sligo and Roscommon also.

In page 62, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"38.—The Minister shall within one month from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on Sharia Compliant Finance and on the resolution mechanism to be undertaken in the event of disputes or misunderstandings of same.".I am moving this amendment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Burton.  The amendment anticipates difficulties in resolving conflicts and disputes in a growing niche industry about which Deputy Burton knows a great deal more than I do.

I am thankful she was not present in the House when Deputy Ring was trying to gain advantage for rezoning around Westport.As I understand the point at issue, there may be a conflict between two systems of law where disputes arise.  There does not seem to be a great deal of jurisprudence to guide disputes resolution in these circumstances.  This amendment would require the Minister for Finance, within one month of the enactment of this legislation, to make a report on Sharia-compliant finance and on the resolution mechanism to be undertaken in the event of disputes arising.  I ask the Minister for Finance to commit, within a reasonable period of enactment, to clarifying this issue in the House.  As I understand it, a document was presented on this area of finance to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service by the Department of Finance.  While I am not a member of that committee, I believe this amendment focuses on a narrow point, that is, the issue of dispute resolution.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	935	Once this legislation is enacted, it will apply to any transaction coming within its terms, irrespective of whether it has been entered into by a member of the Muslim community or whether it is Sharia compliant.  The question of a separate dispute-resolution mechanism does not arise in this context.  The legislation provides for tax treatment in three specified financial transactions, which are outlined as credit transactions, deposit transactions and investment transactions.  There are equivalents within Sharia law.  While the legislation was framed with those transactions in mind, where there is a direct correlation it will apply to any transaction.  There is no necessity for the amendment because the notion of a separate dispute resolution mechanism does not arise.

In coming to a decision on the Bill it is necessary to consider four questions.  First is the nature of the problem and whether it requires a new law; second is the question of considering the other sides of the argument; third is a recognition that in debating any such legislation we are also debating the law of unintended consequences; and, fourth, we must debate whether the Bill contains any defects.I will deal first with the nature of the problem, which derives from the volatility of commercial rates.  They increased significantly during the boom and are now decreasing significantly, perhaps by as much as 20% or 30%.  The problem relates to institutional investors who are refusing, for various reasons, to reduce the rents they are charging, with the result that businesses are being driven to the wall and jobs lost.  We are all aware of the need for the State to restore its competitiveness.  However, competitiveness is not just about wages but also about utilities, the cost of services and, in particular, the cost of property.  Whereas property prices and commercial rents have declined significantly, it is clear that when it comes to institutional investors and financial institutions, many are resisting market pressures to reduce rents.  That is unacceptable.Nevertheless, the second issue to consider is whether there is another side to the argument.  Landlords and institutional investors claim they cannot reduce rents because rental yields are linked to pension returns, investment returns and insurance premia.  There is probably some validity to that, but it leads to another question in regard to capitalisation and the capital values held by pension funds and institutional investors.  In many cases values are being attached to commercial leases that no longer reflect their real value.  The reason institutional investors will not reduce rents is that they are maintaining the pretence that their leases are worth more than they are.  That is similar to what the banks did before the banking crisis.  It is a cause for concern that these pension funds and insurance companies may be two years away from the same type of crisis and that the values listed on the balance sheets for these leases, properties and linked rental yields are not reflective of reality.I put down several parliamentary questions on this issue to the Minister for Finance in recent days.  In addition, I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform whether any banking institution, pension fund or the NTMA had, in the past 18 months, made representations to him in regard to the potential impact that a retrospective end to upward-only reviews would have on commercial prices and, if so, whether he would publish those representations or the minutes of those representations.  The Minister confirmed today that he received, in May 2009, a representation from the Irish Association of Pension Funds commenting on the impact that a retrospective abolition of upward-only rent reviews would have on property values.  This confirms what I am saying.The third issue to consider is whether there may be any unintended consequences arising from the Bill.  I cannot see any such consequences.  The fourth consideration is whether the Bill contains any defects.  The answer is that it may do so in that it interferes with existing contracts and there is also the constitutional issue in regard to property rights.  However, this is not the first Bill that interferes with existing contracts.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform did so, as did the divorce legislation and the legislation introducing financial emergency measures in the public interest.  Moreover, when it comes to property rights, that is ultimately a matter for the Supreme Court to decide, where the legislation in question is deferred to the court by a decision of the President, perhaps in consultation with the Council of State.  There is no reason we cannot pass this Bill today and allow the President to refer it to the Supreme Court where a judgment could be delivered quickly as to its constitutionality.In summary, this is a substantial problem that requires intervention.  The proposal does not remove the protection that exists for landlords; just because we eliminate this clause does not mean they have to reduce rents but simply that they must negotiate them.  If it is the case that financial institutions have bogus capital values attached to certain properties and certain leases, we will have to deal with that problem sooner or later and we may as well do it now.  I cannot see any unintended consequences of the proposal.  It probably has defects but they are not insurmountable.  On balance, therefore, it is a good legislative proposal which addresses an issue of genuine concern.  It deserves a Second Reading.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	939	I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch on introducing this Bill.  I see no defects in it and welcome its provision of measures to address this serious situation immediately.  I was disappointed at Question Time yesterday when the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, told us that we must gather more information and set up a review group before taking action on this issue.  How many more review groups and agencies does the Government need to consult in order to discover there is a problem that is getting more serious by the day?  There is evidence of shop closures, with the associated job losses, on every street in the country.  I am fed up with the Government's recourse to review groups, which amounts to nothing other than inaction.  We have seen that in the past two years since we began discussing the jobs crisis in February and March 2008.  We have had two years of inaction and nothing different being done by various Departments.  I am tired of it.Retail Excellence Ireland conducted a survey in September 2009 on rental contracts in the retail sector.  Members of that organisation told the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment that more than 80% of business indicated a need for immediate reductions in rent.  Of those, more than 50% required reductions of 25% or more just to survive.  Some 64% predicted they will be out of business within two years if they do not succeed in securing a reduction in rent, with most of those likely to shut up shop in the first year.  At the committee meeting we asked departmental officials what plan there is to assist the retail sector in respect of rent reviews and everything else.  They looked at us as if we were talking gobbledegook.  Even though all forecasts at that time were pointing to a loss of 60,000 jobs in the retail sector, the Department had no plan in place to prevent such losses.  Since then, 30,000 of those jobs are already gone.  Are we simply to sit back and wait for another 30,000 to be lost?  Departmental officials, who are the responsibility of the Tánaiste, could outline no plan or strategy for saving retail jobs.  That is what we are seeing across the board in all sections of enterprise.  I tackled the Tánaiste on this point yesterday because I am firmly of the view that she is failing to help small businesses.This simple Bill can be agreed tonight and implemented shortly in an effort to assist retailers.  Last night Deputy Ciarán Lynch read out a letter from a constituent of mine in Navan, County Meath, Ms Kathryn Lynch, who ran an excellent business in Sage and Stone.  That young woman and her sister, mother and friends have worked hard for years to get the business up and running and had achieved considerable success in selling Irish-made products.  They paid high rents and other costs and provided employment, but they had to close the business after Christmas.  Even that does not end her misery because the landlord, who may be a large investor and have some property which will go into NAMA, will, more than likely, pursue her for a personal guarantee.  She could also lose her house.Nobody gains in such a situation.  Businesses in Navan and all over the country will lose jobs and close.  Nobody will gain.  The landlords will not get tenants to sign a lease because they cannot afford to pay rent.  They can chase them through the courts for personal guarantees, but when they get them they will not be worth much.  Nobody is gaining.  What is needed is for the Government to take some responsibility and action in order to sort this situation out and put heads together.  It is fine to say some landlords are giving rent reductions, but the large investors and institutions are not.  Those who have personal guarantees are not giving reductions in rent because they do not have to.  It is the Government's duty to fix that situation.  This is one way to try to help to make a difference.  If we do nothing, we will have massive job losses, which will be on the hands of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers.The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said we need to send out a strong message in the Bill in order to fix the problem.  There will not be a problem with rents in the future because people will have realised the market does not exist.  We have had a problem for the past number of years.  Inaction and a failure to do anything about it will cost us thousands of jobs.  That is a shame.  I have said it before and I will say it again — politics, at a time when it is badly needed in the country, is failing the people, small businesses and the people they employ.  We will have major increases in unemployment.  The most annoying aspect of the problem is that it could be prevented with some imagination, effort, action and some new strategies.

I have never varied my tradition on these occasions.  I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch on his work in this regard.  I was out and about in Tallaght this morning and I broke off from what I was doing in order to sit in my car to listen to the Deputy being interviewed.  He tells a fine story; I mean that genuinely.  Sometimes it is difficult for those on the Government benches to listen to some of the comments on these issues, but the Government and the Minister have made strong points on the legal situation.  I will allow Deputy Lynch to deal with the politics of that.I agree that we need to be innovative and accommodating as far as job creation is concerned.  All Members know I live in Tallaght which has lost almost 7,000 jobs over the past year.  I am standing on the Government side saying that.  This is a day when Tallaght has been in the news for all sorts of different reasons.  I was reminded today that a secretary said——-

Some years ago a secretary told me not to panic because another crisis would be along in ten minutes.  It has been that sort of day for those of us who represent Tallaght.  However, this is an important issue and I appreciate the many e-mails and calls I received from all over the country.  I thought I was not known outside of where I live, but I have received e-mails from the Dublin region.  I am a proud Dubliner.  I have also received e-mails from all over the country and my constituency.  This is an issue.  Private Members' business is good because those on the Opposition benches can raise issues of concern, some of which are serious, help the debate and provide an opportunity for Government Deputies to make a contribution on the various matters.Deputy Varadkar referred to the Square.  It opened in October 1990 and has been a great place for Tallaght.  When it opened, we said Tallaght had the population of a city and the status of a village.  Thank God the situation has improved significantly.  Tallaght was always a great place but it is now even better and has the kind of facilities one would expect in a major population centre.  It is the third largest population centre in the country.  I admit when I get off the Luas and go into the Square that I see the challenges faced by small, medium and large businesses.  For example, in the past number of days, the 12-screen UCI cinema in the Square closed, a decision which astounded me and resulted in 50 more jobs being lost.Shops are closing in the Square, something which is happening in other shopping centres and the streets of Dublin.  I do not know if all of these issues are about rents and the inflexibility of landlords.  It is a good debate and we should tackle this issue.  When I had the opportunity to discuss jobs at a meeting yesterday with First Step, I found the days of Japanese and Americans coming in with thousands of jobs are gone.  We must find ways to help small businesses in whatever way we can.  The Government spoke about the legal status of the Bill.  The principle of tackling this problem and helping people to create jobs and survive and prosper is good.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, will take careful note of what all Government speakers said during the debate and pass it on to the Minister, whom I expect to take account of these matters.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	945	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  It is particularly important because there are more than 280,000 people working in the retail sector across the country.  It is estimated that some 30,000 of those workers have lost their jobs in the past year.  Tonight we are focused on the issue of rents, but other issues affect retailers, such as rates, wages and other costs which make operating a business in Dublin particularly difficult.  Research indicated the 5th highest rent rates in the world are achieved in Grafton Street.  For a country which has a population equivalent to that of the greater Manchester area, it is unrealistic and unsustainable, as previous speakers have said.Retailers in 2009 in Dublin, including members of the Dublin City Centre Business Association, have paid more than €80 million in rates to Dublin City Council over the past year.  If the Labour Party is serious about helping retailers, it would ensure its colleagues on Dublin City Council would further reduce rates for retailers in Dublin city.  It should reduce rates in line with deflation.  The Labour Party could do so and help retailers, but I do not think it will do so.  As a party so long in Opposition, it is more used to playing to the gallery than doing anything concrete.Over the past number of months a large number of retailers have been in touch with me regarding the issue of commercial rents in the city.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	949	It would appear the biggest problem they face is the refusal of institutional landlords to discuss anything in terms of a reduction in rents or a realistic rental rate.  In some cases people are locked into 25-year leases, with nowhere to turn if the landlord does not show any willingness to negotiate.  The drastic change in the economy over the past 18 months has meant the existing leases into which people are locked with upward-only rent clauses are no longer realistic.  In addition to the problem of the unwillingness of institutional landlords to talk, there is also the issue of the arbitration process which is currently used in rent reviews.  It is flawed.  When one sees a small newsagent at the top of Grafton Street having its rent increased by 18%, there is clearly a problem with the arbitration process which has to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.I very much welcome the recent decision of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, to set up a working group.  Deputy English said it is a review.  It is not review; it is a working group seeking to ensure we have a sophisticated response to a very complicated issue.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	950	I was quoting the Minister, who called it a review.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	951	It is not just a simple black and white issue, as Deputy Varadkar indicated.  There are two sides to it and we have to tread carefully to ensure that we do not give a cash injection to lawyers throughout the country.The Labour Court currently provides a system whereby employers and employees are encouraged to negotiate and bring about dispute resolution.  If a similar framework was put in place for property owners who are unwilling to engage, it would certainly be a step in the right direction.The Government''s employment subsidy scheme is very positive and there is also the enterprise stabilisation fund.  However, these will be negated if we do not ensure institutional landlords negotiate and support small and medium enterprises.  We have torn up the rule book when it comes to the banks, venture capitalists and big business.  We need to tear up the rule book when it comes to the small retailer and small and medium enterprises throughout the country.  We have to think outside the box and take action as a matter of urgency.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	952	I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on ensuring that, since 28 February, all new rent review clauses will be construed as providing that rents can go up or down without reference to the rent payable immediately prior to the review date, which is a welcome development.With regard to leases already entered into, it is clear from a legal and constitutional perspective that wholesale interference with existing lease arrangements, which are essentially matters of private contract between individual parties, is not a feasible option.  While this is a pity, that is the legal advice we have received.  It is also clear that any move in the direction of imposing a rent freeze across the board would be impossible to implement in a constitutional manner.To state the position briefly, the advice received from the Office of the Attorney General is that real legal and constitutional difficulties would arise if property rights were to be affected retrospectively.  Opposition efforts to pretend otherwise are mischievous and have no basis in legal reality.  There is nothing of practical value for hard-pressed businesses from these Opposition efforts.  I wish I could agree with the Opposition and say there is something of value, but I cannot.The real issue is that ordinary businesspeople who have properties for rent, of whom there are many in my constituency, have for the past two years or more negotiated their rates with their tenants in an effort to keep them.  They have been very fair and, when tenants have shown their accounts, the tenants and landlords have struck a deal which is manageable and which, hopefully, the tenants can live up to in order to maintain the employment in these small businesses.Small and medium businesses created 500,000 jobs between 1996 and 2006, which is a startling figure given that most of them have fewer than ten employees.  These are the businesses on which this country depends to maintain employment and to revitalise, reinvest, re-engage, expand and try to keep going.I condemn out of hand the old style of landlord from past times, when we had tenants on one side and landlords on the other.  We had the tenants' bank and the landlords' bank for big institutions.  This is where the problem lies.  All of these people are playing a merry game at this time, namely, waiting to get into NAMA and artificially putting up their prices while trying to keep a level to the value of their property, despite some areas having become ghost towns and ghost villages.  They are playing a game whereas the tenant is trying to survive and pay his way by paying his rates, tax, insurance, PRSI and all the other charges, while attempting to keep his doors open for an ever longer time to compete with the big businesses.  In some cases, landlords got badly burned with these bankers but that was not the fault of tenants.  Some landlords are playing an artificial game which must be brought to an end.  The sooner NAMA gets up and running, the better for all of us.I could refer to many other issues, including that of bank credit.  Ordinary business people and SMEs cannot get the credit which is the lifeblood of their business and they cannot get paid on time while, at the same time, they have to deal with joint labour committee, JLC, orders which are out of date at this time.  All of these matters were negotiated in the boom times.  I am all for a fair day's pay for a fair day's work but we have to revaluate where we are going.  We have to maintain jobs for our people and maintain our small businesses, which are the backbone of the country.  We must also try to combat out-of-town developments through the planning guidelines.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	953	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This issue is critical for us, particularly in regard to the difficulties in the retail sector and the many thousands of small and medium enterprises which are struggling at this time.  Many individuals and families are struggling and experiencing heavy pressure but there is no monopoly on struggle at this time, when there is worry about paying the bills, whether domestic bills or rent and service charges, which, in many cases, are levelled by faceless pension companies and offshore companies simply popping these rate and rent demands through to struggling retailers.I have personal experience of this, having been a victim of upward-only rent reviews before I got into politics.  I can tell the House it is a shock when one's rent and service charges are doubled.  While there may not be an upward-only rent review clause written into the contract, the tenant negotiates with the landlord, some of whom, quite honestly, have no conscience when they are negotiating with struggling retailers.  I experienced this for many years as a bookseller, so I believe this debate is very timely.The gravity of these issues should ensure that all of us, not just politicians, take issues such as rent reviews and rent prices seriously.  Regrettably, I am unable to decide whether the Labour Party is being serious with the Bill it has brought before the House.  It brought a similar Bill before the House last year and that legislation was panned by Government and, indeed, by Fine Gael because of its legal infeasibility.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	957	I find it hard to believe the Labour Party actually believed the retrospective imposition of downward rent reviews on existing commercial leases was possible.  As others have stated, including Deputy Chris Andrews, we simply cannot tear up the rule book for those who enter into contractual agreements.  The wording of Labour Party's Bill demonstrates that extending section 132 of the 2009 Act to current leases is not possible.  The Minister has outlined for the House the practical difficulties arising from this Bill, such as the issue of a mechanism to ensure compliance by landlords with the Government's version of retrospective rent review.I welcome what the Government has announced in the area of helping retailers and those paying commercial rent with leases.  The ban on upward-only rent reviews last month was welcome, and something the Green Party and I highlighted the need for to the Minister on several occasions.  I trust that the new working group established by the Minister will provide creative and sensible solutions before issues get into court and before people have to close their doors.If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle took a walk around many of the shopping centres in Dublin or any of the major urban centres, he will see boarded-up shops with lovely pictures of strolling couples with babies in buggies, but nothing behind the mural except a closed-up shop and a story of heartache.  If we can get this working group together and ensure there is strong negotiation between landlords, pension companies and retailers, we could get some of the 42,500 small and medium enterprises up and running again, particularly in the retail sector.The Labour Party, which long talked about implementing the Kenny report but never did anything about it, should pay heed in this regard.  The new windfall tax on the sale of land rezoned after purchase will prevent speculation on land.  A site value tax, when implemented by this Government, will also help as it would incentivise development and investment on a site rather than speculation on new lands.  The commitment by Government to amend the Data Protection Act to allow the publication of sale of property data and a new Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government database of residential and commercial property sales will also help to ensure decent rental prices for all in the future.  Like anything else in life, dialogue is important whether in personal, political or business relationships.  With dialogue we can ensure decent rents.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	958	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  We all realise the value of small businesses and retailers to the economy as they account for approximately 250,000 jobs.  Like other speakers I have concerns about the big institutional banks and insurance companies who drive rents upwards.  I acknowledge they are in business to make a profit but in the current context, they have a social responsibility.  They should recognise that our economy is going through troubled times and endeavour to facilitate their long-standing clients, their tenants.  Politicians should encourage them in every way to be realistic about rents.  It is not much good for them to close down a business and have vacant premises.  It has been commented that NAMA is responsible for some of these upward rent reviews and this is not the case.  NAMA has neither an impact on nor regulatory authority for rents.Legislation on upward rent reviews has been enacted but this cannot be changed retrospectively in the case of existing leases, which is a significant difficulty.  In my view, landlords have a social duty to try to accommodate their tenants in the short term until the economy moves out of the current downturn.  Rents should be based on the turnover of a retail unit.  This is a more equitable way.  If a business is doing well, the landlord will gain if a percentage of turnover is agreed as rent.  I will make this suggestion to the new review group.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken the right approach by setting up this review group and all interested parties, including Departments, will have an input.  The deadline for the report is 30 June 2010 and this is welcome.  I am sure all Members will look forward to the report.I take issue with Deputy Ciarán Lynch, although I congratulate him on his work on the Bill.  I heard him speak on RTE radio this morning.  He was asked a simple question as to who are the legal advisers to the Labour Party but he refused to answer.  At the same time he is decrying the advice of the Attorney General to the Minister——

If the prophets of gloom in this House were a little bit more responsible and were not spreading this daily doom and gloom, people might spend a little.  If only 5% of the €88 billion was spent — €5 billion — we would achieve an income on VAT alone of €1 billion.  I ask the Labour Party to talk positively about a change and not to go through the motions of putting people into further doom and gloom.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	965	I accept that this is a Labour Party initiative but it is recognised as an issue of fundamental importance by all sides.  There is a difference of opinion about how to proceed.  On the basis of legal advice provided, the Government has no choice but to vote against the proposal.  However, there should be no misunderstanding of the concern that resides on this side of the House.  We all know the stress and strain suffered by the retail sector, much of it as a result of the recession and the expansion of the retail sector that took place in the boom years.  The sector is now undergoing a contraction.  It is clear it will not be possible in a normalised environment to retain the same level of retail activity that took place at the height of the boom.  There will be a contraction because the retail sector grew to meet the splurge of the boom.There is a fundamental problem with the rent structure.  I support the objective as set out in the Bill of trying to find a method to get rid of upward-only rent reviews.  The Government initiative with regard to new leases is welcome but there is a fundamental problem in dealing with property rights retrospectively.  The Minister has alluded to this difficulty.Many landlords, particularly those outside the more recently developed entities, have taken a practical and pragmatic approach.  They are working with their tenants, notwithstanding the conditions of the lease, and have reduced rents and this is to be welcomed.  To tar all landlords with the same brush would be wrong and I recognise that many landlords have acted responsibly.A number of landlords who are predominantly within the institutional sector are landlords of the big retail developments and they are holding a strict line for their own reasons.  Some developers are in the same boat and they have no choice because their financial institution is demanding that they continue to retain rents at a very high level to support the payback of loans.  Some banks are playing the game of inflating property values in advance of the transfer of loans to NAMA.  I urge NAMA to take a critical approach to the valuation — as required by the legislation setting up NAMA — to ensure the level of return on the leases is apparent and to establish the kind of return on the leases that is sustainable in the long term.  I have no doubt NAMA will do so and that it will not be in the interests of the banks to retain the level of rent roll to somehow prop up a false or misleading value for the loan.It is regrettable that the working group is not reporting sooner than June but I understand that time is required to produce the report.  Despite what Deputy English said, I believe this will be a very effective mechanism for dealing with what has been a cloak and dagger operation of understanding the forgoing of rents in particular areas.  Pressure must be applied to the financial institutions and this can be done by means of the public interest directors who have been appointed.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	966	I wish to share time with Deputies Brian O'Shea, Jan O'Sullivan, Seán Sherlock and Joe Costello.Businesses in Ireland have been placed under enormous stress since 2008.  Despite plenty of warnings, the Government has taken little or no action to prevent major employers such as Dell, Waterford Crystal or SR Technics from leaving Ireland, the result being thousands of redundancies.  As a result of these job losses and closures, thousands of workers have no option but to join the ever expanding queues at the social welfare offices up and down the country.  The Government continued with this approach with jobs in Cadbury's under threat and when 300 jobs were lost in the hangar 6 fiasco.The Government pins its hopes on bailing out the banks.  So far, we have put €11 billion into the banks, not including NAMA.  It is estimated that we may have to put an additional €10 billion to €15 billion into our banks once their loans have been transferred to NAMA.  What do the citizens of Ireland get for all of this?  Increased lending charges, bankers telling us to tighten our belts and no lending to businesses.Despite the blather from the Government that NAMA was necessary to get credit flowing, the opposite is happening.  A reply to a parliamentary question from the Tánaiste stated: "There is no doubt that banks are making significant credit available to businesses."  The facts speak for themselves: the ISME bank watch survey from 1 March showed that 55% of businesses were refused funding.  This compares to 42% in October 2009 and 20% in May 2008.  According to Central Bank statistics, private sector credit declined by 6% in the year to December 2009.  Whatever the Government's stated ambition to get credit flowing, it has not worked.This Labour Party Bill is about protecting jobs and businesses by allowing for a downward review of commercial rents on existing leases.  Consumer spending has collapsed from the highs of 2006 to 2007 and will not recover for a long time.  Since footfall and spending is down, businesses must cut their costs.  We have a crazy situation here in Ireland where existing rents can only be reviewed upwards.During the boom, Dublin was one of the most expensive places to rent in the world.  By contrast today, Irish towns and cities are blighted by abandoned shops.  One of the most disgraceful practices that is occurring is that a number of landlords are attempting to substantially increase their rents despite the economic reality whereby almost every business has a substantially reduced turnover on the Celtic tiger levels.  It seems that some of these landlords are increasing rents in order to make the valuation stronger when they are transferred to NAMA.  Dundrum Town Centre is planning to increase rents by 60% in 2010 and the Pavilion in Swords has attempted to increase rents by 100%.Small enterprise and local shops are shedding jobs and going quietly into the sunset.  The small trader feels the pinch every bit as much as the large enterprise.  A job lost, a shop closed or a restaurant on the brink are all equally painful for the person at risk.  The Government has stated that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has established "a new group to look at the issue of commercial rent reviews".  Does it not realise that the situation is at crisis level?  Has it fallen down the rabbit hole with Alice, living in a land where, if it can protect the banks and the developers, the rest of the economy will magically recover?  We need action right now, not another report which may not be acted upon for over a year.  Like every other Deputy and Senator, my e-mail inbox has been inundated by messages from businesses urging the implementation of this legislation and talking about the number of jobs that will be saved in companies across the country if rents can be renegotiated.As spokesperson on tourism, the failure of many restaurants, gift shops and other retail outlets is highlighted to me on a daily basis.  The tourism industry is hugely important to this country and if the infrastructure is not sustained, apart from the impact of the immediate job losses, it will take years to rebuild the industry.  There are many complex issues underpinning the tourism industry but exorbitant rents are a large part of its ailment.  For the protection of one of Ireland's most important industries a downward rent review is essential to their survival.There are 436,000 people on the live register.  There are a number of businesses which are on the edge and the continuation of unsustainably high rents will force them to cease trading, destroying the Irish economy as well as pushing more people into the ever expanding queues at the local social welfare offices.  We need action now to give business every chance to survive and help bring Ireland out of the economic morass in which it resides.  Everyone gains from this Bill with the exception of the landlords, many of whom are foreign pension and investment funds with no ties to Ireland.  The choice for the Government and backbench Deputies is to choose with whom they stand.  Do they stand with the businesses that provide employment and can help power Ireland's economic recovery or do they stand with the foreign pension funds, landlords, bankers and developers who have already done so much to destroy this country?
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	967	At the outset, I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, on introducing the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Review of Rent in Certain Cases) Amendment Bill 2010 to the House.  This critically needed legislation, which would allow downward reviews for commercial rents is most timely.I would like to quote from an e-mail I received today from Mr. Michael Garland, the chief executive officer of Waterford Chamber of Commerce:The general situation here in Waterford is that businesses have cut so much out of their cost base that often the only costs left to tackle are rates, rent, water charges, employers' PRSI etc.  These cost centres are out of their control.  There needs to be direction on all of these issues for businesses, and not just for rents.  Simple small changes to all these costs will have a huge cumulative effect, a positive one, for any business.  For example, a reduction in the PRSI rate, as well as a reduction in rent, could be the very thing that stops business making a person unemployed.It really is as simple as that.  I understand this and I do not have to be an economist.  Of course, upward-only rent reviews should be addressed, and businesses, where they find themselves in this situation, must tackle their landlords as soon as possible and put a coherent business argument or plan together to get a reduction or moratorium on any rental agreement.Strong direction from Government would help act as leverage for individual cases.  Clear Government advice on the issue must be communicated.  We need strong leadership on the issues facing business at the moment.  Immediate action now will secure many jobs and immediate action will mean we are better placed to take advantage of any future upturn in the economy.  Businesses have collectively made these brave, strong decisions and we must see others follow suit.Commercial rates in Waterford are a massive issue for business.  Businesses are hanging on by their fingertips in the hope that a strong summer tourist season will arrive.  Without that, the consequences for business and employment will be catastrophic.  We are in the sharpest economic downturn in the history of the State with banking decisions no longer being made in cities like Waterford, but in Dublin, and credit for small and medium size businesses being scarce at best.  This is in spite of the vast resources the State continues to provide to the banking sector.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated last night that we as legislators need to be here, breaking our backs to find workable and practical solutions that will lead to real jobs and real prosperity.  I could not agree more.  What evidence is there, however, that the Government is producing such solutions?  The Government's response to Deputy Ciarán Lynch's Bill, which was thoroughly researched and backed by legal opinion, is to dismiss it as legally and constitutionally unsound.  This was done without the production of the legal opinion underpinning the Minister's dismissal of it.  Let us test the opinion in the light of day and work as a Parliament to find an urgent, agreed solution for those many business people and workers, who live with the daily fear of their businesses collapsing and their jobs disappearing.Urgency in problem solving appears to be anathema to this weary Government.  It is bereft of the ideas and energy needed to overcome obstacles such as the one this Bill seeks to address.  People need hope, leadership and confidence that jobs are being created and economic recovery pursued, but the Government's inability to take bold action will only push them deeper into despair.When governments cannot, or will not, do the jobs they are elected to do, it is time for them to go.  The Government's opposition to this Bill is further evidence of a siege mentality which is paralysing its will to address the many urgent problems which have been inflicted on Irish people as a result of the wasted years since 1997.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	968	I found the contributions from speakers opposite to be somewhat pathetic.  They spoke about the importance of protecting businesses and the unfortunate legal reasons that they cannot do what obviously needs to be done.  The Government is taking a cannot-do attitude.  It cannot get the banks to lend to small businesses or help them hold on to their employees and it cannot do anything about upward-only rent reviews.  We need to see a can-do attitude because we were elected to this House to solve the country's problems.Deputy Ciarán Lynch has stated that he introduced this Bill, for which I commend him, in the knowledge that the Government may not be willing to accept it in its entirety and that he is happy to see it amended as necessary.  All we have heard from Government Deputies, however, is that they wish to do something but unfortunately they cannot.  This must be an extremely dispiriting outcome for the thousands of people who have contacted us by e-mail over the past week or who have followed the debate from the Visitors Gallery.  These people are struggling to keep their businesses alive but now they are being told the Government can do nothing for them.If contractually agreed rents can be adjusted upwards, I do not see why they cannot also be reviewed downwards.  I do not understand why these obstacles are being erected.  We have been told by the Government that this is because of constitutional imperatives but I understand the Landlord and Tenant Acts allow rights to be taken from landlords in certain circumstances and I have been advised by someone with legal expertise that an escape clause or compensation mechanism might address any constitutional infirmity in the legislation.  Nominal compensation to the landlord may be a way around the obstacle.We are here to solve the problems that face our country rather than hide behind obstacles.  If we are worth our salt as public representatives, we will listen to the people when they tell us about their problems.  Like everybody else, I have spoken to business owners in my constituency.  In areas of Limerick which have been subject to urban regeneration schemes, the very landlords who received sizeable tax incentives from the public purse are now seeking to increase rents.We are beginning to see ghost streets where businesses are closing in the heart of my city and, I am sure, elsewhere.  We simply cannot allow this to continue because these businesses are the bedrock of our economic recovery.  Multinationals will come and go but indigenous companies are our hope for the future and we have to find ways of supporting them.  We cannot allow them to close their doors because of legal mechanisms that make no sense in the current economic climate.  They have clearly experienced decreases in sales volumes and are facing significant difficulties in paying overheads and remaining open.  The idea that one cannot revise downwards a rent set at a time when the economy was in a completely different position is nonsense.If constitutional obstacles arise, I suggest we can find remedies for them, and if the Government wishes to amend elements of the Bill, it should do so.  The Labour Party is attempting to address an extremely serious issue for businesses in this country and the least we expect from the Government is a can-do rather than a cannot-do response.  Hiding behind the advice of the Attorney General when nobody else is allowed to examine it is not acceptable for a Government, even one which I hope will not be in power for much longer.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	969	I listened with interest to the arguments put forward by Government Deputies, particularly from the Green Party Member from Carlow, because I never heard such patronising drivel in all my life.  To suggest that we are giving businesses a false hope by bringing forward this Bill reflects the unreality of Green Party Deputies.  This legislation tries to find positive solutions to the real problems that people face in villages, towns and cities throughout the country because they cannot renegotiate their rents.We are taking a realistic approach to the problem, backed by a sound body of legal opinion.  Deputy Kennedy's demand that we put our legal opinion before the House is merely a digression from the issues at hand.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13608	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	971	Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are aware that we are offering a genuine solution but they will not even entertain our attempt to build a positive outcome.  I remind Deputy White that the Bill seeks to address the emergency that has arisen in regard to upward-only rent reviews and the substantial economic havoc that such provisions are wreaking on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Rent reviews, which normally occur every five years, are resulting in the wind up of a large number of companies.  In many cases, liquidators are having to exercise special statutory powers to disclaim onerous leases and the effective abandonment of businesses results in substantial employment losses.  This Bill attempts to find a solution to this serious issue.  We are not giving anybody false hopes when we seek to find a way to help these businesses survive and flourish.I do not know if Deputy White received as many e-mails on this issue as I did.  I wish to share with her one such e-mail I received from a lady in Mallow who operates a small niche business called Fountain of Angels.  Her rent is €8,500 per annum.  She told me in her e-mail that the upward-only rent review clause is unfair and discriminates against tenants.  It is putting her under significant pressure and calls into question the viability of her business.  If she tries to leave, however, the landlord is entitled to pursue her for loss of income for the remainder of her lease, which happens to have a term of 11 years.  This situation is not helped by auctioneers who give misleading information and it reflects every e-mail we have received on this issue.  This is a real issue and it must be dealt with in a real political sense and that is what we seek to do tonight.Other matters that must be tackled include the hold on legal opinion and the hold that auctioneers, landlords and property owners have over people.  We should think more laterally about how to allow businesses to survive, a purpose at the heart of the Bill.  The proposals are perfectly realistic for people who live in the real world.  We do not contend that we are giving people false hope.  We are serious enough to put forward a Bill of this nature because we wish to tackle this issue realistically such that we can give small businesses an opportunity to flourish.  That is the motive from which this Bill emanates.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	972	Since there is no other offer to speak I call the Minister of State.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	973	In opposing the Bill, the Government is very conscious of the fact that many in the retail sector have welcomed it and have approached Deputies on all sides of the House seeking their support for its content.  It has been presented as an emergency solution to a very pressing problem.  However, the solution proposed will not work in practice and is not legally tenable.Reference has been made to the possibility that a parallel exists between the emergency action sought in this area and the legislation introduced last year to address the difficulties faced by the State with regard to the public finances.  However, entirely different legal issues arise in the case of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, which concern the financial obligations on the part of the State.  The rationale and justification for that legislation includes the overriding public interest in controlling public spending, reducing the shortfall between expenditure and revenue and reducing the unsustainable levels of public borrowing.  These imperatives do not apply in the case of commercial leases entered into between private parties.As a general principle, great care must be taken in altering by legislation the contractual rights of parties in respect of contracts which have been freely entered into where the effect of the alteration would be to impact directly upon the amount of rent which has been agreed as between those parties.  Such an alteration would also impact upon constitutionally recognised property rights and great care is necessary to ensure any impact is necessary and proportionate and does not amount to an unjust interference with those rights.  In terms of broad principle, legislative restrictions which affect property rights retrospectively are prima facie unjust, as they seek to alter the effect of previously completed legal transactions.I intend to elaborate upon one point which was referred to during the course of this debate, that is, the alleged link between NAMA valuations and demands on the part of some landlords for high levels of rent increase.  It has been already stated that any attempt by landlords to increase the value of their property by seeking to impose unsustainable rent increases would have no impact on the valuation placed on such property by NAMA.  NAMA will purchase land, development loans and certain associated loans from participating credit institutions.  The valuation of these loans takes account of the underlying security attached to them.  However, NAMA's valuation experts will take account of the rents they deem likely to be realised on a sustainable basis as opposed to optimistic projections supplied by participating institutions, debtors, associated debtors or other interested parties.Deputy Leo Varadkar referred to a reply to a parliamentary question, dated today, which indicated correspondence had been received in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform concerning the impact on investment property of a retrospective change to existing leases.  He drew certain inference from that correspondence.  However, the Deputy neglected to refer to the second element of the reply which indicated that the decision not to apply the prohibition on upwards only rent review to existing leases was dictated solely by legal and constitutional considerations.I refer to the way in which Government continues to be active in supporting local businesses and employment and in stimulating local economic revitalisation throughout the country at all levels.  The undoubted problems of the retail sector cannot be divorced from this wider perspective.  Among the actions taken by local authorities is one to keep commercial rates increases to an absolute minimum.  Last year, some 34 local authorities held their rates at 2008 levels.  For this year, the annual rates on valuation have decreased by a national average of 0.62%.  Local authorities are also taking steps to ensure reductions in staffing levels are rot focused on front line services and are rigorously examining their costs to maximise efficiencies.In addition, all county and city local authorities have now established business support units or equivalent arrangements in their areas.  These support units are effectively a one stop shop for businesses and aim to facilitate local enterprise creation and retention.  They work in co-operation with a number of other public agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards and local development companies to assist and support projects and entrepreneurs.  The units also co-ordinate the services of the other council departments in areas such as planning, water and roads.Measures have been also taken in respect of VAT to assist businesses and individuals in the current difficult economic circumstances.  Thus, with effect from 1 January 2010, the standard rate of VAT was reduced from 21.5% to 21%.  This reduction applies to all goods and services which had been subject to VAT at 21.5%.  It is hoped that the measure will improve competitiveness and consumer confidence and give a necessary lift to business and the community.In the energy sphere, the Government is determined to promote competition in the energy market to maximise the pressures for greater efficiencies in the sector.  Government action has already seen a fall in energy prices for Irish business with reductions in 2009 of more than 15% for electricity customers and 20% for gas customers.  The restoration of competitiveness is also a key factor in rebuilding our economy.  There are encouraging indicators in this regard and the Government is firmly committed to exerting downward pressures on prices in all relevant areas and to build upon the significant progress made in 2009.Overall, the Government is committed to maintaining low business taxes and a favourable regulatory environment and will work to ensure its policies keep pace with the way business is changing.  Job creation is a key priority and is a driving force behind much of our work in stabilising the public finances and in getting our banking system working again.As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already observed, in addition to prohibiting upward only rent review clauses in leases entered into on or after 28 February last, he has established a working group to consider the issue of rent reviews in the context of the arbitration system which operates at present and to assess the adequacy of the information available to all parties during the rent review process.  The group has been mandated to report by the end of June and its establishment is a practical step towards addressing a particular problem which has been identified by the retail sector as giving cause for concern.A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am happy to let Deputy Costello say a few words if he wishes.

It is the first time that I have had the opportunity of thanking him for sharing his time with me and with the Opposition.The present convulsions in the Irish economy have revealed some strange practices in commercial activities.  What ordinary citizen in his or her right mind would have imagined that commercial rent reviews could only be upward and that a downturn in the economy could not be reflected in a similar downturn, or reduction, in the existing rent of commercial premises?The Government's attempt to rectify the anomaly last year, in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, only applied to new leases and thus fails to address the existing business leases which are the real cause of the problems.  The Government has refused to move beyond this point referring, as the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did last night, to the Attorney General's advice, which the Minister has not published, and blaming the Constitution as the obstacle.This is exactly the same hands-off position adopted by the Government on the Kenny report on land valuation after rezoning.  If implemented at the time it was published, the Kenny report would have prevented most of the corruption of the planning process and the reckless rezoning, which has destroyed much of our urban, and indeed, rural landscape and has given rise to a number of tribunals of inquiry.The question that the Government should have put to the Attorney General was whether it was constitutionally correct that a one-sided system of upward-only evaluation of commercial rents that could benefit only one party, namely the landlord, should be recognised and was enforceable in the common law of the land.  That was the question that should have been asked.The constitutional requirement of natural and social justice, fairness and the public interest would seem to suggest otherwise.  For example, liquidations or assignees in bankruptcy cases can disclaim or walk away from the leases of insolvent companies or bankrupt individuals where they believe — mark my words, they need only believe — the terms of these leases are unduly onerous.  That can be done within the present law without infringing constitutional principles.Indeed, a better example is to be found in the Minister's Act, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  Section 50(1) of the Act states:A servient owner may apply to the court for an order discharging in whole or in part or modifying a freehold covenant (whether created before or after the commencement of this Chapter) on the ground that continued compliance with it would constitute an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the servient land.The Act goes on to state, in section 50 2(f), that the court shall have regard to “whether compliance with that obligation has become unduly onerous compared with the benefit derived from such compliance”.  Thus, if it is constitutionally possible to set aside or modify a freehold covenant or agreement where the obligation to pay is unduly onerous, then surely it cannot be unconstitutional to set aside a leasehold covenant where the obligation to pay has become unduly onerous?  There are precedents.  The Minister did not choose to go near them.  If he had done so, then this piece of legislation could now be enacted.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	985	First, I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, onbringing this Labour Party Bill to the House in response to the economic emergency in which we find ourselves.The evidence of the economic emergency mounts by the day.  Some 270 people lost their jobs every day since this Government took office.  One in every three young men of the workforce is on the dole.  Established businesses, such as Hughes and Hughes, are going to the wall because of unrealistically high rents.  Empty shop fronts are spreading across our towns, cities and suburbs.While the casualties of the recession grow, this Fianna Fáil-Green Government prefers to stay in its bunker, more concerned about its members own job security than the security and livelihoods of the people who keep this country on its feet.  Only people who are living in a bunker can ignore the desperate plight of businesses experiencing the sharpest economic downturn in our history, while trapped in leases that only allow for an upward revision of rent.  Only people who are living in a bunker would ignore the steady stream of redundancies from mostly small and medium-sized businesses, which are folding under the twin pressures of their rent burden and their inability to access credit.The Labour Party first raised the issue of upward-only rent reviews in commercial leases in June of last year.  We raised it on the floor of this House on numerous occasions because we believed then, as we do now, that this is an issue of vital national importance.  We believe that every job, and every livelihood, is worth fighting for in this recession.  If viable businesses are going to the wall because they cannot legally negotiate a more appropriate rent, then we as legislators have a duty to respond and we have a duty to find a solution.Unfortunately, this Fianna Fáil-Green Government does not agree.  In response to pressure from the Labour Party last year, it made a small change to the law to allow for a downward review of commercial rents.  However, this change only applies to new leases negotiated on or after 1 March this year.  It does nothing for the vast majority of businesses placed under unbearable pressure because of the terms of their existing lease.In fairness, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not entirely forgotten the sector.  He decided to do what the Government always does when faced with an urgent problem — he set up a committee.  This committee, he tells us, is due to report on the negotiation process for commercial rent reviews in June of this year — almost a year to the day after the Labour Party first raised the issue.  I want to ask him how many viable businesses have had to shut up shop since last June because they were not entitled to negotiate a more appropriate rent, and how many more will close before next summer, when his committee is due to report.In 2009 alone, 30,000 people lost their jobs in the retail sector, at a cost to the Exchequer of €600 million.  How many more jobs will be lost because the Government would rather save face than pass the Labour Party's legislation?Make no mistake about it, more jobs will be lost.  There is already evidence of owners of NAMA properties demanding large increases in rent from their tenants in order to maximise the value of their property in the NAMA process.  It is clear that some landlords are not interested in the long-term viability of their tenants' business, but rather are looking to save their own skin now that the property bubble has burst.Yesterday in the Dáil I asked the Taoiseach a straight question, whether his Government would support our legislation to allow for downward revision of commercial rents in existing leases for a limited period.  I asked would he and his Government support a straightforward measure that would ease the pressure on the retail sector, and save jobs.  He said, "No."  He stated that our proposed legislation is unconstitutional, but he refused to publish the advice he received from the Attorney General to that effect.This is a typical response from this jaded Government — negative, closed to solutions that come from outside and closed to compromise.  The Taoiseach will shortly be meeting a world leader whose motto is "Yes, we can.", yet our country's leader and the Government seems in every instance to say, "No, we can't."The Taoiseach is mistaken in this.  We can have a solution to this problem.  The Labour Party's proposal is in keeping with both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution for the following reasons.  First, our proposed legislation is in the public interest.  It is a clear response to the national emergency of high unemployment and a devastated retail sector.  Retail sales fell by 14% in 2009, following on from their sharpest ever decline in 2008.  The value of goods sold in 2009 was down almost 20%.  People are consuming less overall and spending less when they do.  This is a response to the catastrophic rise in unemployment on the Government's watch, a drop in people's disposable income due to a raft of income tax increases and pay cuts and a steep decline in consumer confidence and security.  On top of this precipitous drop in demand, businesses find themselves unable to secure credit from the banks.  In short, they find themselves in an impossible situation without any of the usual means of weathering a downturn.The Labour Party has made positive proposals to address these issues to get our economy moving again.  The Government, however, has consistently chosen to ignore them.  This legislation would provide some immediate relief to businesses experiencing the sharp end of the Government's economic mismanagement and going some way towards halting the haemorrhaging of jobs in the retail sector.We are not proposing, as the Minister claimed last night, a wholesale assault on property rights.  It is far from it.  Our legislation is a measured and proportionate response to the perfect storm that has beset our economy.  Our legislation provides for a two-year period, in which rents under existing leases may be reviewed downward, upward or remain the same.  This is simply to allow viable businesses and their landlords to negotiate a realistic market rent, which reflects the prevailing economic climate.We are not asking that landlords accept less than the market rate for their property.  Rather, we are proposing the market be allowed to find its level in a way that is equitable for both landlords and tenants.  As the law stands, it is only tenants who are feeling the full brunt of market economics while landlords are cosily protected.  As one business owner in my constituency wrote——

The Minister does not have to shoot it down just because he does not agree with it.  The world will not end if the Bill passes Second Stage.  Allowing it to proceed to Committee Stage would allow an opportunity for the law on upward rents to be teased out.  Doing so might also offer some practical assistance to those businesses trying to negotiate some relief on their rents.  That is assistance they will be deprived of if the Government votes down this Bill tonight.  If it does, the message that will go out to those negotiating rents will be that the Government has taken the side of the landlords on what are now active rent negotiations.

Last evening, the Minister claimed, on a procedural point, he only received a copy of the Bill on Monday afternoon and said in future it would be important that Bills were made available to him as soon as possible.The Journal Office was notified prior to 11 a.m. on Friday as to the subject of the Labour Party's Private Members' time.  At 11.38 a.m., the Journal Office e-mailed political parties and several individuals as to the business.  Among those who received the e-mail was the Chief Whip's office and an individual in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The e-mail advised copies of the Bill were available from the General Office.If there was a problem with the Minister receiving the Bill on Tuesday afternoon, it was an internal problem in his Department.  The Minister may want to address that.

He also dismissed those in the Visitors Gallery as a rent-a-crowd brought to the House by the Labour Party.  They were 50 members of the retail industry employing 15,000 people.  They were probably more interested in what the Minister had to say than what I had to say.  It would have done the Minister the world of good if he returned them the courtesy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, delivered a short script that made no mention of the Bill.I have many rebuttals I can present to the Minister's legal arguments and which Deputy Gilmore has challenged him to take to Committee Stage.  The Minister's legal opinion is ultimately about defending the NAMA portfolios and protecting the rental property bubble.  If this Bill were to proceed, it would show the whole valuation process the Government has put together is a house of cards, based on notional values that do not stand up in the market place.  It is a market place in which retailers are now finding employment, materials and energy costs are secondary to meeting the rent for institutional landlords.Up to 20,000 retail stores employ just under 300,000 people with 30,000 losing their jobs last year in the sector.  The upward rents are a significant national matter.  This Bill recognises the emergency the country faces in this regard.  It is a wake-up call to the Minister and the Government that there are real problems happening in the real economy affecting real people every day.  The Minister, along with his party colleagues and the Green Party, which is now indistinguishable from Fianna Fáil, must allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage where it can be tested and give some measure of hope to businesses struggling every week.  It would send out the signal that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that the country believes in recovery and that the unsustainable, unrealistic, uncompetitive position in which retailers find themselves can be dealt with.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	I understand my officials have circulated an information note on Islamic finance to members of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.On the question of a dispute resolution mechanism, the legislation was framed to encompass various transactions but it must be understood that when it is enacted it will apply to any transaction coming within its terms, irrespective of whether it has been entered into by a member of the Muslim community or the transaction is in fact Sharia compliant.  The question of a separate dispute resolution mechanism does not arise in this context.  Disputes about the tax treatment to be applied to a particular transaction are governed by the taxing legislation and if one of the parties to a specified transaction considers that the wrong tax treatment has been applied, that party can appeal to the appeal commissioners, from there to the High Court and exhaust the usual statutory remedies that apply.  No separate appeals mechanism is required here.If a question arose about Sharia finance in the course of such a case, it would not be an issue of law but an issue of fact because foreign law is a matter of fact to be proved in any case.  It is not a question of Irish law.  It would be determined as an issue of fact in so far as there is a dispute of fact, and the law that would apply would be our taxing statute.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	I thank the Minister for getting his officials to supply us with the briefing document on Sharia finance.  The document is useful in so far as it goes but the introduction of Sharia law into Ireland would be rather like if we were to reintroduce the Brehon law code to Ireland.  It is another legal code with a social and legal framework of understanding and once Sharia law is established, we must be guided broadly by the inspiration, structures and strictures of what Sharia law means.In introducing such a concept into Irish law, I accept that the Minister essentially wants to facilitate people in the financial services centre who want to compete on a worldwide basis for global mobile finance which relates to financial entities, sovereign wealth funds and so on and which may be grounded in Sharia law.  That is fine, but if we are introducing such concepts into Irish law they are deserving of debate and of a wider explanation to the public.As I said on Second and Committee Stages, I have the honour, along with the Minister, of representing a significant number of people living in Dublin West, whether from the Bosnian community or from other communities, who are Muslim.  Many of them would like to be able to buy a house using Sharia law finance without the principle of interest or usury being involved but this is about financial transactions in the International Financial Services Centre.  In introducing a measure like this into Irish law, it is foolish not to arrange to have some kind of public debate on the different elements of the law.  The International Financial Services Centre is not helped by an image that it exists in a vacuum which is separate from other Irish law, including Irish tax law.  We want a financial services centre that is productive, attractive and so on but I do not understand the reason the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance are consistently afraid of debating in detail the implications of changes in law, including the introduction of something like Sharia law into Irish tax law.As somebody who has some experience of Sharia law, I am aware that Sharia law has many implications, as the Minister may be aware, in particular for women.  I do not know whether the Minister's officials have given consideration to that but there are also extremely important dispute resolution mechanisms when issues, difficulties and disagreements arise in regard to Sharia law contracts.  All I am saying to the Minister is that consideration should be given to that aspect.The Minister's response is predictable, which is that while the tax law in the Finance Bill provides for Sharia law, a dispute resolution mechanism is not required because dispute resolution will be subject to the Irish courts.  That is fine but in the long term it is likely to be unrealistic.  The Minister may hold to his view that the ordinary Irish courts, under the structures and traditions of Irish civil law, are sufficient.  I suggest to the Minister that they may not be and his advisers and officials should have given consideration to that.We have law faculties in most universities and institutes of technology.  We have a fair number of law lecturers who are Muslims from different parts of the world.  I recommend to the Minister that his Department should host a seminar.  If he wants to have a development of understanding about this concept being introduced in Irish law, the way to do that is to debate it in public and not introduce it as some arrangement which is exclusively for people in the International Financial Services Centre.  That is to make it almost a novelty and a type of hidden element in Irish law.  That is not sensible.  We would be much better debating the pros and cons of it.  Like all legal systems, it has advantages and disadvantages.  Obviously, for people who are of the Muslim faith, because its approach to law is underpinned in the Koran, it is particularly attractive and important to them but if it is being brought into Irish law, its pros and cons should be identified, including a dispute resolution mechanism.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1044	I would like to answer the questions raised by Deputy Burton.  She is labouring under a fundamental misapprehension in that we are not making Sharia law the law in Ireland in this legislation.  We are talking about Sharia financial transactions.  The governing law is Irish law and the dispute resolution mechanism is Irish law.  We are not conceding ground to some foreign tribunal or religious tribunal about a final determination about the implications of these transactions in Irish law.  An Irish court seized of this matter will apply the law as enacted by the Oireachtas, not Sharia law.  If an issue arises in regard to the latter, it must be proven as it applies to financial transactions.  It must be proven as a matter of evidence before the court and the court must have the residual power of public policy if the particular transaction infringed public policy.It is difficult to see, in regard to a financial transaction primarily concerned with the morality of lending, how an issue will arise in regard to public policy in the State.  Clearly, if questions arose relating to gender equality, for example, an issue might arise.  I do not envisage it arising.  It is, therefore, important that the House understand we are not legislating for the express enactment of Sharia law in Ireland.  This legislation facilitates transactions that are structured in a Sharia-compliant way.  Our law facilitates transactions that are facilitated in a US-banking-law-friendly way.  It is only common sense for us to do the same in regard to Sharia financial transactions in our financial arrangements as an incentive to attract investment into the country and not to automatically bar and double-bar the door of investment to that group that believes in structuring its financial arrangements in the Sharia way.  There is no abdication of the powers of the Irish Legislature in dealing with this matter along those lines.A separate matter was raised by Deputy Burton.  She stated, rightly, that what has been done to date will apply in the context of the attraction of investment in the IFSC.  I have discussed this matter with many of my Islamic constituents.  Quite a few of them are quite content with the arrangements they are in a position to enter into with various Irish financial institutions, or at least as satisfied as any of us can be with such institutions these days.  They have a preference for the arrangements they choose and do not feel conscientiously constrained.  Some, however, do feel conscientiously constrained and it is important to address their concerns.  From a tax perspective, the groundwork has been laid for the introduction of such products in that part of the payments made by a person paying a mortgage may be treated as interest for tax purposes.  However, further changes are required to stamp duty legislation to enable the purchase of a property pursuant to a Sharia-compliant mortgage to come fully within current tax arrangements.  It is anticipated that such measures will be included in a future finance Bill.As far as I am aware, no country has introduced a full measure of provisions immediately.  In this regard, the introduction of tax measures consistent with Sharia financial transactions should be seen as a gradual process.  There are regulatory issues that would require finalisation in that particular context.  I hope that is of assistance to the Deputy, along with the information note.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	With regard to people of the Muslim faith living in Ireland, will the Minister confirm there are two particular areas of difficulty?  One concerns the purchase of a mortgage and the structuring of the deal in order to avoid interest, which is not allowed according to the Koran.  What is the position on two people who enter into a venture such as a restaurant when an investor comes along?  The structure of Sharia law is such that certain rules must be followed regarding taking an interest in the venture, the sharing of profits or interest on a loan that is put into the venture, which under the Koran must be avoided.  I am asking a perfectly reasonable question on a matter that many of my constituents and those of the Minister regard as important in their approach to commerce.All I am suggesting to the Minister is that, perhaps through the many colleges and universities in Ireland, his Department consider sponsoring some debate on this issue.  We are all talking about people being integrated and being able to live in Ireland in a way that reflects their religious beliefs.  However, it is not entirely adequate to talk of bringing in Sharia-complaint finance simply for the IFSC and then ignoring the complexities of the issue, including dispute-resolution mechanisms.

They happen to be the two issues under examination in my Department.  There was a business conference on these matters that included both Islamic and other business interests.  They examined the proposals in the Bill and gave them a broad welcome.Deputy Burton's idea of convening a conference to examine the Sharia-specific issues that affect individual consumer and commercial transactions is useful and I will take it up.  I reassure the House that these matters are under consideration.  As my speaking note made clear, there are complexities associated with stamp duty and the allocation of mortgage interest relief if there is an interest-free mortgage.  These issues must be worked through and we will do so.  The conference is a very good idea in that context.I cannot speak for the Islamic faith but believe the degree of Koranic literalism is clearly far greater than that of Biblical literalism nowadays.  The fact remains that there are substantial numbers of Muslims who have accommodated themselves to existing banking transactions and are content therewith.  There are some, however, who have conscientious difficulties and it is important that we accommodate their concerns.  The conference is a good idea in that context.

Section 41 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the new scheme of tax relief for expenditure on intangible assets introduced in the Finance Act 2009.  The amendments enhance the scheme's effectiveness in supporting the knowledge economy.  Under the scheme, relief in the form of capital allowances against trading income is given on capital expenditure incurred by companies——

It has come to my attention that relief is being sought under the scheme in respect of expenditure which the scheme was not designed in the first place to encompass.  The issue concerns the availability of tax relief under the scheme for expenditure incurred on the provision of an excise liquor licence.Since a new liquor licence can only be obtained through the courts by extinguishing another licence, a considerable amount of the expenditure incurred in acquiring a new licence relates to the extinguishing of an old one and obtaining the consent of the holder of that licence.  It has been argued that this expenditure and other related costs arising on the acquisition of a new licence represent capital expenditure on the provision of a specified intangible asset.  In other words, a liquor licence is an intangible licence and therefore falls within this particular relieving provision.  The purpose of the amendment is to put beyond doubt that this cannot happen.

That is probably appropriate following our discussion on Sharia law.  The Ceann Comhairle has advised me that my amendment No. 37, which relates to licensing of products sold in head shops, is out of order.  Deputy Bruton has a similar though less detailed proposal in amendment No. 38; I do not know whether his amendment was ruled out of order.  What I propose in amendment No. 37 is an early and rapid remedy in regard to the various substances for sale in head shops which have given rise to so much concern throughout the State.  The Minister should give consideration to using the powers of the licensing laws, which he holds as Minister for Finance, to licensing those types of outlets.  That is one way of seeking to control the dangerous substances sold in some of them.  Deputy Bruton's amendment is similar.I refer to these proposals in the context of the Minister's amendment No. 20, with which I have no difficulty, because it deals with the issue of licensing a particular product, namely, alcohol.  Why would the Minister not agree to addressing, in the same manner, the substances for sale in head shops?  All sorts of outlets where substances that could harm people if used inappropriately, such as alcohol and medicines, are subject to licence, but the Minister seems to have rejected out of hand the notion of licensing head shops.

I assume, subject to the ruling of the Chair, that my amendment is in order because it relates to a tax relieving provisions.In regard to head shops, the Government made a decision at the Cabinet meeting of 2 March to begin a notification process under the appropriate European Commission directives of our intention to make a declaration order under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended, declaring these substances, products and preparations to be controlled drugs for the purposes of that legislation.  We have initiated the essential discussions that must take place with the European Commission before we can introduce the necessary restriction.  We are optimistic about the discussions in which we are obliged to participate before we can proceed to prohibition.I have responsibility for the licensing of bookmakers' offices, as we know from previous discussions, but I do not have responsibility for the intoxicating liquor code, which rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

We are taking steps to deal with the products sold in so-called head shops.  In addition, the declaration order under the 1977 Act will include some substances that have legitimate uses as medicines but which can be subject to misuse, as well as certain narcotic and psychotropic substances which Ireland is obliged to bring under control to comply with the relevant United Nations conventions.  As soon as the necessary consents issue from Europe, these prohibitions will be put in place by the Minister for Health and Children.  In any event, without criticising the proposal, I am not sure the licensing route is the appropriate route to take in this type of premises.  Instead, we must close them down and outlaw the substances they sell.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1057	Has the Minister an indication of the timeframe for the introduction of such regulations?  There is an active concern among the public about these operations.  The reason we and others suggested a licensing approach is that it has the advantage of immediacy and there is no issue in regard to State aid or unfair competition rules.  Much depends on how quickly the Minister for Health and Children believes she can get the necessary powers.

In page 77, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"(e) by inserting the following after subsection (12):"(13) The provisions of this section shall apply to a sole trader in the same manner as they apply to a company.".".This proposal was discussed in committee in the context of the concession introduced by the Minister last year whereby companies that are establishing would get a refund of tax as an incentive to support their start-up.  At a time when enterprise is scarce and many people have lost their jobs and are considering establishing businesses, we propose that a similar concession be granted to sole traders.  Some 70% of employments with fewer than 50 employees are sole traders and there are significant numbers of people in this category.  While Ireland has a comparatively good record in the establishment of new businesses, the recent trends have been downwards and the new enterprise establishment is slipping.The Minister was unwilling to accept this proposal in committee because of the open ended potential cost and the fact that the concession for sole traders could be at 41% whereas in the case of companies it is confined to 12.5%.  However, it seems to me that he could design a concession ring-fenced to sole traders starting up which would be a significant boost to those who are now being forced by necessity to go down that route, which for many people is daunting and expensive.  Some concession towards that would be desirable.

Will the Minister indicate what he would expect the cost to taxpayers to be if this concession were available to sole traders at the marginal rate as well as at the lower rate to limited companies?  The majority of people who set up in business do so as sole traders rather than limited companies.  I understand the Minister's emphasis on control in terms of limited companies, getting high-tech companies establishing as limited companies and so on.  However, there is a worry that this could force sole traders to establish limited companies to avail of the relief.  In the majority of cases, smaller companies pay little or no tax in the first few years.  The danger will be that we will have limited companies making losses and forced to take salaries out to meet day-to-day living expenses.  They will gain very little from setting up as limited companies rather then sole traders, and that could jeopardise the financial viability of their businesses.  A majority of businesses take, in the main, about five years to establish.  The first three years are critical, invariably from the point of view of cashflow.  The small amount of tax they may have to pay might be the difference between surviving and not surviving.  They are already under pressure in terms of getting money from the banks.The Minister should take the comments of Deputy Bruton on board and come up with a hybrid form of what he is providing for a limited company.  I can see the merit, in terms of structures for companies with a high worth which are entering high-tech areas, many of which will be established as limited companies.  However, we are in a recession and if the Minister wants to encourage people to become self-employed, the majority will set up as sole traders.  It is a pragmatic and reasonable suggestion for the Minister to take on board.  He could introduce a form for the sole trader at the standard rate or a lower rate.  There should be some form of equity vis-à-vis the limited company.  I would like to hear the Minister’s thoughts.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	The intention behind this amendment is that the exemption from corporation tax provided by section 486(c) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the income and gains of new start-up companies should be extended to sole traders.  Deputies opposite acknowledge that I do not want to go over ground which has already been covered.  The rationale was to encourage those who are unemployed to set up as self-employed sole traders.  I am not convinced about this amendment because the inevitable pressure will emerge as to why a person setting up in salaried employment cannot avail of a similar relief.  The incentive is aimed at stimulating new activities, which I appreciate, but the operation and impact of the incentive is better targeted, monitored and controlled by confining it to companies and leaves it less open to unintended manipulation.My opposition to the amendment is not primarily on cost grounds.  It remains the case that the incentive, in its current form, is more cost-effective in terms of value for the Exchequer's revenue forgone than would be the case if it were extended to income tax liabilities.  Resources are scarce and we need to invest them in areas where we believe we will get the best return.  The logic of the proposal to provide tax relief to individual taxpayers who are start-up sole traders could be extended in order to provide a similar tax exemption to individual first-time employees.  The trend in all of our tax arrangements in the past 20 years has been to try to equalise the position of the self-employed and those in employment, and this proposal points in that direction, namely, that I should provide a similar tax exemption to individual first-time employees.  I would like to be able to do that, but I am not in a position to do so.  We have scarce resources.The Opposition referred to the different rates of tax during the debate, which creates a multiple of costs in terms of the impact of the proposed relief.  A further important point can be made for maintaining the provision of the relief through the corporate tax system.  Any additional funds or savings arising through the relief and retained in the company's structure can be used to reinvest in the business, which is the intention behind the incentive.  If, on the other hand, additional funds or savings are paid out by the company for the benefit of directors or shareholders they will be subject to income tax in the normal way.There is a safeguard, in terms of the use of the savings generated, as intended by the incentive.  It would not be available if one extended the liabilities of a sole trader or a non-corporate entity.  In contrast to the position for start-up companies, there will be no tax charge to be paid as a result of drawing funds out of the business in a non-corporate context.  There are various grant aid and other supports available to persons setting up a new business, through the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland.  I will not discuss the entire scheme and the different channels in place.  Suffice to say, there is already substantial public investment in incentives for those who do not have companies but wish to start up businesses.  The form of the relief, as it stands, is a valuable protection for the taxpayer, in so far as moneys generated as a result of the relief have to be re-invested in the enterprise or are subject to taxation.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	The Minister referred to consistency between the PAYE system and the self-employed.  There are two elements to this.  A person who is a PAYE worker received a tax credit of €1,830, which is the same amount as the personal tax credit which a person who is self-employed does not get, which does not detract from a person who enters a PAYE job; the employer and not the employee takes the risk.  If a person establishes himself or herself as self-employed, he or she is taking a huge risk.  The Minister is missing the essence of the amendment.  He referred to the cost to the taxpayer.  The overall cost to the taxpayer of a person who in unemployed is €20,000 per year, a fact which is recognised and accepted.I know of clients who set up limited companies when they could not afford to do so.  They should set up a limited company if they are paying tax, which they normally pay at the marginal rate.  People will be forced to establish limited companies in order to avail of the relief.  Such companies will make a loss.  The people concerned will be forced to take a salary in order to pay for general living expenses to look after themselves and their families.  It is fine if a limited company is making profits and there is a PAYE return to the Exchequer.I am worried people will set up limited companies and by doing so will threaten the viability of their companies.  Why not allow people to set up as a sole trader in the initial period, if that is the correct route, and introduce a reduced form of the relief for limited companies?  We need to provide some incentive to encourage people to set up as self-employed.  The Minister is missing the essence of the point.  The majority of people who are self-employed establish themselves as sole traders.If they speak to any professional, they are advised to set up as a sole trader initially.  They will be advised that if they establish a limited company they will face the difficulty of being the director of such a company.  If the company becomes insolvent such people face major legal consequences.  There are filing requirements and auditors fees.  The Minister could allow the provision to be granted for one or two years.  There should be some incentive to encourage people to set up as self-employed and get people off the dole queues.This measure will encourage people to set up as self-employed by way of a limited company.  If we studied the issue in a year's time, we would find many people have not become self-employed because they found the consequences of setting up a limited company are prohibitive in the short term.  Every person who leaves the live register is saving the taxpayer €20,000.  The Minister has overlooked that point; he might address it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1064	I support this amendment.  In the real world when somebody is starting out in business it is a very traumatic time.  We should encourage such people to do it properly, as Deputy O'Donnell said, even if the measure was limited to a certain number of years.  One has to be in the position of having started a business and moved from a level of security in order to understand the natural fear which is involved, especially if one has a family.  Anything which makes it easier for people is good, which is what this country badly needs.  We need to encourage people at this time in our history.  It would take people out of the black economy and make them register properly as a sole trader.  They will get something for a couple of years.  This is the sort of spirit which is needed.To say that people set up limited companies is fine, but every penny one has when one is starting out is like gold dust.  The Minister should try to set up a limited company in this country and see all the bureaucracy, regulation and red tape which is involved.  If one is in the financial services industry, one is a small trader.  There are all sorts of bureaucracy.  If we want to encourage people, little things like those suggested by Deputy Bruton are very important.  We should give people encouragement for a year or two, in order that when they are established, feel confident and take on one or two employees, they can then form a company.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, they will then have their accountant advising them.  At that stage, it would be more beneficial for them to enter into this whole area of forming a company.  The initial years are the important ones in giving people the confidence to get out there and to start to do things properly.  For them to have any assistance we can give them would be well worthwhile.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1065	We saw a leaked version of this document on innovation.  It makes the valid point that we need to have a cultural shift in the way we think about enterprise in this country.  I am not pretending this is a perfectly designed relief, far from it, but it is one that was recommended by the Commission on Taxation.We need to see something coming from Government on how to create this new culture of enterprise because many professional and skilled people are losing jobs and the likelihood is that most of them will emigrate.  Some will go into the black economy and take the nixer route that is well known but one that ultimately undermines the effective operation of an economy.  They are facing into trying to start up businesses in a credit-starved environment and, as that report points out, they are in a situation where bankruptcy and the failure of business is regarded as so awful that one cannot get credit again for 12 years after a business failure.I am not pretending all the answers are encapsulated here but we need a new attitude to establishing businesses and getting them off the ground, and to supporting people who are willing to take a chance.  I do not see any evidence of that, other than in regard to the back to work allowance, which was extended this year and which was the only gesture towards the establishment of new business.I can understand some of the arguments the Minister is making and, if I was on his side of the House, I am sure I would be focused on how revenue could leak away in unintended ways.  However, we have to step back from the usual Revenue view of every relief to see how we can create a culture that is supportive of enterprise at a time when we vitally need skilled and trained people in this country to have a go.  In Silicon Valley, they say a person has to have failed three times to be worth taking a risk on.  We certainly do not support that type of attitude to enterprise, innovation and having a go.I would imagine the Minister will explain that while he will not support the amendment, he will try to come up with a much more targeted incentive aimed at key sectors which he feels can contribute to growth and can pick up skills we might otherwise lose to the State.  While I am not fully optimistic that will be his response, I will not detain the House on this matter as we have had a good ventilation of the issues.  However, we will have to come back to this agenda, if not to this amendment.

I am not sure, by the way, that if a person fails three times there would be an extraordinary tax liability as the person might have quite an amount of losses to carry forward.That said, the issue is really the untargeted character of the proposed relief.  The distinction between the contract of service and the contract for services is of course fundamental in the whole income tax code in so far as the individual natural person is concerned.  This is why the Revenue authorities are far more comfortable administering a relief with a corporate garb, which I can understand.  There may be a case for examining whether there is an intermediate category of persons in particular areas.  However, it will have to be very carefully ring-fenced because the introduction of this on a generalised basis could be very difficult.There is the seed capital scheme as well as the back to work allowance, so there are a number of schemes in operation.  As Deputies keep reminding me, we have to work out what these reliefs cost as they are expenditures.  It is not just a case of "Would you not feel sorry for a fellow, give him a few bob and leave him go".  We have learned they are a cost to the Exchequer.  I find it extraordinary that we spent so much of our time in committee denouncing what happened in regard to tax reliefs in various directions and we then turn around and look for new sets of tax reliefs.  The lesson to be drawn about tax reliefs is that we must measure their value, which is why I have put in place  a new procedure with the Government so people must stand over them in the Estimates process.  Governments will have to take responsibility for these because they are expenditures.

In page 91, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"(b) in subsection (1)(a) in the definition of “group expenditure on research and development” by inserting the following after subparagraphs (i) and (ii):"(iii) expenditure (in this section referred to as ‘relevant expenditure') on research and development incurred by a company which is a member of a group in developing intellectual property within the meaning of section 291A that is transferred to a company incorporated in the State that complies with section 495 shall not be included in group expenditure on Research and Development in relation to that group.  The relevant expenditure will be treated as a separate Research and Development activity distinct from all other R&D activities carried on by the group for the purposes of this section.",".This is the targeted type of measure towards which the Minister is likely to be more sympathetic.  It was designed by Senator Paschal Donohoe and I am sure the Minister will get a fuller presentation of its merits from the Senator when the Minister goes to the Seanad to hear its recommendations.Essentially, Senator Donohoe is suggesting that there are ideas which could allow spin-off companies to be established and this measure is a tax incentive designed to encourage such spin-offs.  I know the Senator has made a significant study of the knowledge economy opportunities that are available to us.  This was designed specifically to focus on opportunities that might otherwise go a-begging or be developed elsewhere.An amendment of this nature is worth considering because, while we lean over backwards to produce legislation that will facilitate financial services establishments to set up business here, and more power to them, this was designed to focus on whether within our own pool of talent we can see spin-offs that would generate economic activity from good ideas that have been developed within companies but which might not be core to a company's activity.  It would encourage the launch of these as business opportunities.Of course, the Minister will say there is the risk of revenue loss, which no doubt there is.  However, this is genuinely targeted at new business start-ups.  I know a more jaundiced eye is examining patent relief at present and perhaps the recycling of some of the patent relief money into ideas like this could bring about a better spin-off for the country in terms of high value start-ups that have a chance of developing into the future.I ask the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.  He will go to the Seanad and then come back to this House and, if he is not persuaded by my arguments, which have been cobbled together, I am sure Senator Donohoe will bring to bear new logic on this matter.  The Minister may return to this House saying "Now, I see it.  It was just not explained very well in the Lower House".

I am not prepared to accept the amendment this year because of the difficulties associated with introducing such a fundamental change into the tax code, and it is not entirely clear where the amendment would fit into our existing arrangements.I made a number of arguments in this regard on Committee Stage and I do not want to rehearse them all.  The fundamental argument is that while we provide incentives for R&D activities undertaken, we do not incentivise any resulting spin-off commercial activity.  A decision to do that at this stage would have far-reaching effects.  The new scheme of capital allowances for the acquisition or provision of intangible assets was introduced in the 2009 Act, as Deputies are aware.  When a company acquires intellectual property for development and commercialisation, it can claim capital allowances and the scheme, in conjunction with the current corporation tax rate and the research and development credit, encourages investment in research and development and the commercial exploitation of intellectual property.  Where there is this added incentive for commercialisation, especially where the company which undertook the research and development is not itself equipped to commercialise the research and development — this is what arises here — the proposed amendment is a very significant change and has knock-on implications for capital gains tax.  It could be argued that an incentive of this nature would encourage companies to dispose of intellectual property, IP, arising from their research and development activities and make a once-off windfall gain rather than take the commercial risk of exploiting the benefit of the intellectual property.  If the IP is disposed of, there is no guarantee it will be commercialised and result in economic benefits and employment in the economy.  Where the tax system encourages the acquisition of IP, as is the purpose behind the current scheme, it is more likely that the company availing of the incentive will be geared towards exploiting the commercial potential of the patent.I reiterated much of this information on Committee Stage but it may be some comfort to Deputy Bruton's proposal.  As I said on Committee Stage, the proposal is worthy of more thought and I will ask my Department to consider it further in the context of the range of incentives available to encourage and support innovation and the knowledge economy.

It seems there is a question over at least some of our research and development spending and that its commercialisation is the issue.  We have very highly trained academics who, forever and a day, would engage in blue sky research and so on.  However, I do not know of any report — it may well have been done — that has attempted to quantify the extent of commercialisation of that work.  Does the Minister have any sympathy for the central proposition here, which seems to be to move it on to that area rather than simply giving reliefs for companies to invest in research and development?

It is a very far-reaching change in the context of the current tax code and certainly could not be introduced at this stage of the Finance Bill without further reflection.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1075	I thank the Minister for his considered reply.  I share Deputy Rabbitte's view.  We are committed to a big science and technology spend each year and none of us in this House is competent to judge the value of much of that work.  It is done on faith and both the Minister and Members will be urged to sustain and enhance that spend in future years as part of a commitment to the knowledge economy.The other issue raised by Deputy Rabbitte is central in terms of how effective we are in using it.  I note Enterprise Ireland has launched what it terms "competence centres", which are designed to try to get better application of research coming from universities.  While this amendment may not be perfectly designed and could be improved, it could dove-tail with other initiatives of that nature to try to ensure that the spend in which we are engaged and the ideas generated in Ireland are commercialised.  I, therefore, welcome the Minister's commitment to at least have his officials look further at this proposal.  The world has changed and we are going to have to look to ourselves and ideas generated here as a source of enterprise and a knowledge base for the future.  We must re-equip ourselves.Our tax code has been rather lazily designed around trying to attract other people's ideas or, unfortunately, supporting property and we need to think afresh about how we as a country can make a living in the future.  Sadly, we became diverted onto a disastrous path in recent years and we have to find a road back to a more genuine base of enterprise that can sell abroad.  We perhaps are not the best equipped to understand the choices that have to be made, but we have to start learning pretty quickly and familiarise ourselves with this territory and how we can exploit it for the future of our country.

I propose to take both amendments together.  The amendments correct a drafting error in section 59 of the Bill as amended on Committee Stage.  That section amended section 611 of the 1997 Act which granted relief from capital gains tax to disposals to the State, charities and public bodies.  Disposals to such bodies generally do not give rise to a liability to capital gains tax.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1085	The application of the carbon tax was raised by a number of interests, even though they were in the ETS, the trading scheme.  It has been represented by a number of these interests that this is a form of double taxation and that they are already paying under the ETS.  If I recall, the Minister's line on Committee Stage was that he was obliged by an EU decision to apply a minimum rate of tax because, otherwise, it would be regarded as a State aid.  This has been disputed by the sectors involved and the Minister may be in a better position to shed light on the situation.   State aid rules require him to levy this additional tax because if we did not introduce a carbon tax, as many of competitors are not, these companies would be in the ETS code and would not be asked to make this contribution.  It is contradictory for the Commission to argue that if a member state introduces a carbon tax, it must impose an extra charge that would be anti-competitive for Irish industry in categories competing with other industries in the same category operating in other member states.I wonder about the validity of the argument made on Committee Stage.  We must be conscious of knock-on effects.  If we can content ourselves with the trading system, we should do so.

Such producers are competing against State bodies such as the ESB that are exempt from the tax, whereas those from the private sector who are installing combined heat and power facilities, which are highly energy efficient with low carbon outputs, feel they are being discriminated against.  In the interests of equity and energy efficiency, parity should apply.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	These amendments raise complex and difficult issues and I will address amendment No. 33 first.I previously indicated the only exemptions from the carbon tax are for those companies within the EU emissions trading scheme, where a carbon pricing mechanism is already in place.  I did not offer any exemptions for sectors outside the ETS.  For combined heat and power technology, the amendment addresses that.  Combined heat and power used outside the ETS will not be exempt from the carbon charge.The Government acknowledges, however, the environmental benefit that can accrue from the use of high efficiency CHP technology.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 provided that expenditure on CHP technology is allowable under the scheme of accelerated capital allowances.  That scheme allows companies to claim 100% tax capital allowances on expenditure on certain energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase.  It is not, therefore, appropriate to put in place a further tax subsidy.We must ensure the carbon tax has a broad base and I do not want to undermine that principle.  The long-term impact of the carbon tax will be to incentivise energy efficient processes such as combined heat and power.  The intention of the legislation is that where it is used outside the ETS scheme it will not be exempt.  That is the general principle I have applied in that context.Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 32 raises more complex issues.  It is concerned with a full exemption for the mineralogical processes, including the burning of coal for the production of cement, from the carbon charge in the case of gas and coal.  The cement industry in Ireland relies by and large on coal on an intensive basis for generation of the product.  The Bill provides that a full exemption will apply to ETS installations in the powergen sector but ETS installations in other sectors will be required to comply with an EU minimum rate.  It is far lower than the rate of carbon tax, around 2%.  In practice, no additional charge arises in the case of mineral oils as the existing mineral oil tax rates satisfy the EU minimum rates and these companies within the ETS continue to pay those minimum rates.Implications arise, however, in the case of gas and coal.  These products have not been taxed or, in the case of coal, have effectively not been taxed up to this point.  There are difficult issues about the relationship between the ETS scheme and any domestic taxing statute.  The carbon tax, therefore, brings gas and coal into the tax net for the first time and, consequently, the Bill provides for the application of the EU minimum rate.  The EU minimum rate in the case of gas is about a sixth of the carbon tax rate, about €0.54 per megawatt hour.  While the introduction of carbon tax on coal and other solid fuels remains subject to a commencement order, when coal becomes the subject to the carbon tax, the rate will apply to ETS installations at €4.18 per tonne, a ninth of the full rate.  That is the provision in the Bill.Since Deputy Bruton raised the question, I engaged with the cement industry and discussed its difficulties.  It worked hard to generate exemptions within the EU scheme for coal in this context and has undertaken to share its legal advice with me and I will be reflecting on that before the consideration of this matter by Seanad Éireann.  It is not an easy matter.  If it was in any sense uncompetitive, it would require the industry to refund the State the sum involved in the event a breach was identified.  There is a legal risk here that must be evaluated.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20814	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1088	I welcome the Minister's willingness to examine this further.  The exemption under which the powergen sector operates could also apply to the cement industry in certain cases.  It is a question of consistency with the energy taxation directive.  Just as the powergen sector could fulfil the requirements, the argument is that the cement industry could do the same.  I do not know the legal niceties of the case so I can only trust the Minister's efforts will find a relief if one can be obtained.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	The Minister referred to ETS installations only.  Combined heat and power installations save approximately 25% of the energy required to generate electricity in a conventional power station because they are on the host site and many of industries using them are in the export market.  The Minister is proposing the granting of an advantage to a competitor, namely the ESB but there must be a level playing field.  If the Minister provided an exemption for combined heat and power, it would be in line with the established precedent in other member states.  These are companies using combined heat and power to reduce emissions but the Minister is giving an advantage to a semi-State organisation over small producers who are providing employment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1090	As Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, I see a total contradiction here.  The whole purpose of the ETS scheme was to try to do away with carbon emissions.  Anything that would promote alternative sources of energy should be encouraged in Europe and through our tax code.  The whole question of the use of coal to generate power is causing us untold problems as we face fines from Europe because of the energy production sector.  We are way above our targets in terms of fossil fuel use for energy production.  Innovations like geothermal power are receiving very little encouragement and legislation for new types of power generation is lagging.  Surely our tax system should encourage the transfer to new forms of power generation such as wind and wave energy.  It is extraordinary that one can derive a greater tax advantage by generating power from coal, which is one of the main sources of CO2 emissions.  
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1091	We have provided tax exemptions for many of the new technologies which are coming to the market.  In this instance, however, we are discussing a tax which is of necessity general in its application.  The longer the debate continues, the greater my fear that a series of exemptions will be made for special interests.  The carbon tax is of general application and the number of exemptions has been cut to the bare minimum.  The emissions trading scheme is a parallel measure for the electricity sector.  It does not apply to the heating sector and that is the issue.  We have done our best to accommodate the various interests concerned and I cannot see a way of supporting the proposals made by Deputy O'Donnell.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1092	The carbon tax was designed to encourage people away from CO2 emitting fuels.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1101	I move amendment No. 40:
In page 153, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"104. —The provisions of section 134(15) of the Finance Act 1992 shall be suspended pending a review to be carried out by the Minister on the impact section 134(15) will have on the car rental industry.".We discussed this amendment briefly on Committee Stage and I hoped the Minister would introduce an amendment to deal with the problems which are being encountered by the car rental industry.  It has been hit by a number of challenges in addition to the recession and the difficulty of getting finance.  The recently introduced scrappage scheme makes ex-rental cars almost impossible to sell because the resale value has diminished, changes to the VRT and road tax rates have made cars with automatic transmission less economical and the VRT rebate enjoyed by the industry since 1992 has been withdrawn.  Interestingly, the latter rebate was introduced to increase the supply of cars to the rental industry.  The combination of these factors has fundamentally changed the relationship between finance houses, car dealers and rental companies.The supply of cars to the industry has decreased dramatically.  It was almost impossible to get a car last year largely because of financing but companies face additional tax problems this year.  Between 10,000 and 12,000 cars will be available this year, compared to 27,000 two years ago.  As an estimated 20,000 cars will be needed, we will at best have one half of the required fleet.  This is an urgent matter because if cars are not ordered soon they will not be available for the summer season.  Car hire prices are already twice or more those of comparable countries such as Scotland and elsewhere in Europe.Approximately one third of all visitors to Ireland, and 45% of Americans, hire cars.  If cars are not available people will not visit because they will have no way of travelling around the country.  The Minister may be aware that Bus Éireann has just announced a further reduction in its bus services.  This is an important issue not only for the car rental industry but also the entire tourism sector.  People are anxious that something would be done as a matter of urgency.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1102	This a serious issue for the car hire industry and the tourism sector.  The Minister will be aware of the significant rental operations located in various business parks in our constituency.  It now costs far more to hire a car in Ireland than in France and most other European countries.  The supply of cars has diminished at a time when dealers would like to sell vehicles.  The current structure is driving prices up to unsustainable levels, with major implications for tourism outside the Dublin region because most people who arrive in Dublin or Shannon want to hire cars to tour the country.One of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Quinn, introduced a number of initiatives during the time of the rainbow coalition Government to resolve the bottleneck in the Irish car hire business.  The Minister can take his officials' advice on the appropriate mechanisms that can be implemented to address this issue but it has to be addressed.  We need to re-invent tourism in Ireland in the context of our changed financial circumstances.   Attaining value for money in car hire is one of the things people booking long or short stay holidays seek especially through the Internet, which vast numbers of tourism customers use for on-line bookings.  We are not scoring in this regard because car hire is prohibitively expensive in Ireland at present.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1103	I support this amendment although I was surprised that amendments Nos. 40 and 41 were not grouped.  The whole issue of short-term car hire is very significant outside Dublin, especially in my area of the mid-west and Limerick because of people coming in through Shannon Airport.I refer in particular to the scrappage scheme.  The Minister is probably well aware that as it stands, the car fleet is of the order of 13,000, while the optimum level required is probably 26,000 or 27,000 cars.  In Germany at present, the scrappage scheme applies to short-term fleet hire cars.  I tabled a very straightforward amendment such that the scrappage scheme would apply to all normal category A cars or vehicles as well as 2010 registered vehicles that have been let on short-term hire for a maximum period of up to six months.  This would allow car dealers to purchase a fleet of cars and let them out to those who wish to hire out cars and the cars would then be available for the summer season.The Minister should recall there are six new hotels in the Limerick area.  The owners of any bed and breakfast in the region will say foreign tourists invariably hire a car.  There is a mobility factor at play.  There is a concern in this regard because when people go on-line to book a holiday, one of the things they look to do is book a car for hire.  If cars are not available, these people will simply decide to go to other countries because they decide on where to go only one week before travelling.  They no longer book in advance.  When a person seeks car hire it will, invariably, be done by one's partner or wife, but the person will look to where he or she can hire a car.  If such a person cannot hire a car in Ireland they will not come here.  What is required is a very simple mechanism to allow cars registered in 2010 to qualify.The Minister should remember that for every car registered the Government will receive VRT; the Exchequer will get money.  If a car is bought in, the Government will get VRT.

They are bought by the garage and let to fleet rental companies.  Effectively, these firms will let out the car over the summer season and then return it to the garage which will put it on the forecourt for sale.  Those cars will be competing with new cars and they will not take the risk that they will be unable to sell the cars.  There is a function to the amendment and it is about helping the tourism industry.  The Minister should remember that the discussion of fleet hire cars is effectively about exports and about money coming into the county.My understanding is this policy is in place in Germany and we compete with Germany for tourists.  Everyone books holidays on-line now and car hire is a key feature of that process.  The Minister should take the amendments on board.  We are discussing how to boost the tourism industry.  The theme of tonight is that we must think outside the box and be cognisant of entrepreneurial culture.  We must consider the tourism industry and consider the net effects not only the particular once-off effects.  We must consider the cumulative effects in terms of ensuring hotels are full.  PAYE, VAT and corporation tax comes to the Exchequer from hotels and there is a cumulative effect.  I call for a positive response from the Minister as the debate reaches its conclusion and for him to consider taking on board another amendment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	As Deputy Burton pointed out there was an initiative in the early 1990s in section 134 of the Finance Act 1992.  It provided a relief on VRT for cars used to service short-term self drive contracts.  Part of the difficulty was it had a very unhappy history.  Arising from Revenue audits, there was strong evidence that the sector was manipulating contracts to ensure cars used for the provision of services not originally envisaged under the scheme nonetheless benefited from the VRT relief available.  Operators applied this scheme to cars for use outside the tourism area, including the enabling of corporate clients to provide a pool of cars to visiting executives or their own staff and allowing VRT free driving by Irish citizens who hired rather than owned a car, while their neighbours who own cars had to pay VRT.Attempts were made to tighten up the scheme in the Finance Act 2008 to try to limit such abuses.  However, the sector raised objections and concerns.  The scheme, especially following amendment, necessarily imposes a considerable administrative burden on individual firms and the Revenue to ensure that the VRT refund conditions are satisfied and that the scheme is not abused.  A number of meetings were held between the sector and the Revenue.  It is complained that the scheme, if operated correctly, is complex to administer.  It is argued that it not only restricts normal competitiveness between firms but that it limits the potential to grow the car rental market outside the tourism sector to other long-term rentals.  Some operators made the point they would have to effectively maintain two separate vehicle fleets, one for hire to tourists and another for the domestic market, to continue to qualify for the relief on cars actually used in the provision of cars to tourists as the scheme intended.  This would be uneconomical and unworkable in practice.  Given that the scheme was prone to abuse and that it imposed a considerable necessary administrative burden on both the operators and the Revenue to ensure the conditions for the VRT refund are being satisfied, a decision to phase out the scheme was taken and that was done in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008.  This allowed the retention of the previous repayment provision for 2009 with the relief being phased out over the 2010 and 2011 seasons.  It must be recognised that the sector can, compared to previously, make considerable savings on VRT liabilities by switching more of the rental fleet to lower CO2 emitting vehicles.  The price of new cars has reduced and with the July 2008 rebalancing of the VRT system, the average VRT paid on new cars reduced by more than 30% between the first half of 2008 and 2009.The abolition of the scheme will remove existing restrictions and allow operators to develop their business models based on the domestic rental market.  While some firms in the sector may resist the phasing out of this scheme, other operators indicated they would prefer the abolition of the scheme rather than having its use restricted, as a consequence of which, some business models would qualify under the scheme while others would not.  In the meantime, there is no evidence of any significance change in the use of the scheme that prompted the decision to phase it out and I see no argument for further assessment.The wider issues in respect of the tourism industry are a matter for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  If we wish to pay a specific subsidy to provide cars for the tourist and visitation industries then it is something we will have to decide on, but the practicalities of implementing such a measure through a tax based solution are very difficult and that has been the consistent experience since 1992.

One cannot simply use the tax system all of the time to provide untargeted imprecise subsidies to particular sectors when a more targeted subsidy would achieve the same result at a far lower cost.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1120	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, to the House to give details of the Government's recent announcement to increase the number of general practitioner, GP, places in the medical school system, a long overdue decision.  It is a correct decision to increase the level of training for GPs when finances are available at the earliest opportunity.  It is also important when one considers the home and community-orientated direction international best practice has taken in the delivery of primary medical care to patients.  With the advances in, for example, keyhole surgery and other medical practices, people tend to spend less time in hospital and more time recovering at home.The precursor to all of this is the necessity for a much more enhanced level of primary care.  The GP, therefore, is the medical person best positioned to decide on the care of any particular patient.  The practice, heretofore, where GPs were under high levels of stress and pressure, was to refer patients to a hospital environment for further investigation or treatment.  International best practice indicates this is not best way.  There is a need for much more of the work to be done in the community to ensure the best outcome for the patient.The Government aims to increase primary care centres in the environs of doctors' surgeries, at which more diagnostics can be done in the community.  It follows there will be a requirement for a greater number of GPs.  It is welcome that the Government will increase the number of GPs.  It recognises the greater degree of interest from GPs to perform much more of this work in their communities as they wish to develop primary care centresIt is interesting that the Finance Bill has been passed because, while not relevant to this discussion, there is a desire among groups of general practitioners for favourable taxation measures to ensure the development of these centres.  They will not happen on their own or out of the blue.  There is a requirement to assist doctors and investors to ensure the facilities are built and the necessary equipment is provided so these procedures can be carried out in the community.  In welcoming the Government proposal to increase the participation of students at training level, I ask the Minister of State to outline the proposals to ensure an even spread of GPs throughout the country.  As places become available, they should not be concentrated only in large centres of population.  It is important that rural areas get a fair crack of the whip.I give credit to the difficult work GPs do in the community in attempting to work within the change in policy of having more work done in the community.  I pay tribute to the efforts GPs are making and the pressure they are under to deliver that.  We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude for those who managed to deal with the reconfiguration programme in the system.  They continue to provide an exemplary and exceptional service to the communities.  The provision of extra places and extra GPs will help to lift the considerable burden many GPs are under.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1121	I apologise that Minister for Health and Children cannot attend.  There are about 2,600 full and part-time GPs in active practice in the State and some 300 doctors working in a locum capacity.  Of these, about 2,100 GPs are contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme to provide services to medical card and GP visit card patients.The ESRI published a report entitled General Practitioner Care in October 2009.  It found that Ireland has a low ratio of GPs to population compared to other western European nations, with 56 GPs per 100,000 of the population.  In contrast, France, Austria and Germany have more than 100 GPs per 100,000.  The increasing age profile of GPs means the ratio of GPs to population is decreasing.  At the same time, demand for GP care is increasing due to demographic change.  The report predicted total GP consultations will increase by 20% by 2015 and by 33% by 2021.  The ESRI stated that if GP training numbers were increased to 150 per annum, this would make a substantial impact on the shortfall.There is currently one model of GP training in Ireland, which is provided by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  It is a four year model, with two years based in hospital and two years on an approved GP training programme.  There are currently 12 GP training programmes with 120 training places available per year.  A report on primary medical care in the community by the Joint Committee on Health and Children published on 10 February included a recommendation that there be an immediate expansion of GP training places to a minimum of 150.The HSE and the ICGP have agreed to increase the number of GP training places to 157 from 1 July.  The expansion of GP training places is a significant initiative and demonstrates the commitment of Government to the pivotal role of general practice in the Irish health service.  It will support the continued development of primary and community care services, facilitate the delivery of care to patients in their own communities and reduce the need for unnecessary hospital admission.  The increase in GP training places has been brought to fruition by a partnership approach between the HSE and the ICGP.  The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has also been extremely supportive.  The work of GP training programme directors and the engagement of consultant clinicians on a number of hospital sites have also been critical success factors.  It is also pleasing to note that this expansion has been achieved from a more effective use of existing resources and without the need for any extra funding.  The HSE, with the support of the Department of Health and Children, is pursuing a number of initiatives to increase the number of GPs working in the health service.It has held discussions with the ICGP to identify a mechanism to upskill long-term locums or assistants who have not passed the requisite examination or obtained an award of the certificate of satisfactory completion of training from the Medical Council.  It is estimated that up to 250 doctors are involved.  A recruitment drive has been undertaken in the UK and in other EU countries to attract qualified GPs to apply for available posts here, particularly in regions experiencing difficulties attracting GPs.  There is also more active management in each local health office to encourage GP assistantships and partnership for upcoming retirement where such doctors could potentially take over from GPs retiring.  The HSE is continuing to expand primary care teams and primary care centres so that GPs are attracted to high quality, well-supported posts in suitable premises.

I compliment Deputy Dooley for the motion and the Minister of State for the reply to the previous matter.  As someone who was involved in GP training for many years, I welcome this move.  I am particularly delighted that the expansion has been achieved from a more effective use of existing resources and without the need for extra funding.  This is a good news story.  It is a message the Government must get out there.Obesity is a serious problem here.  There are more than 4,000 people who die from obesity-related diseases every year in this country.  In 1960 we had the leanest children in Europe; in 2010 we have the fattest children in Europe.  These are not my words but the words of Dr. Donal O'Shea, an expert in this field.  Recently I and 14 of my colleagues had the honour of participating in "Operation Transformation", the RTE television programme, hosted by Gerry Ryan.  It allowed us to participate and get benefits of taking simple measures to achieve weight reduction.  The public has a major interest in this topic.  The website received more than 3 million hits over the course of eight weeks and more than 500,000 people watched the programme every Wednesday night.  The public wants information on this issue and it is imperative that Members of the Dáil, and particularly the Government, provide this information.Yesterday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, under the chairmanship of Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, held a long meeting on obesity.  It was a very good discussion, with many contributors.  It mainly dealt with the curative aspect, which is very important.  I emphasise two points that arose from the discussion.  There is only one HSE clinic in the country that deals with this problem.  As Dr. O'Shea and others said at the meeting, we should have four, with one in each HSE area.Surgery is essential for those who are morbidly obese.  We need some 400 operations every year and at the moment the HSE has the capacity to carry out 100.  I request that the Department considers providing the facilities to allow it to happen.  However, I am conscious that we live in a severe economic situation.  We must be cognisant of the costs involved.  Prevention is better than cure and "Operation Transformation" showed the way we can achieve excellent results by prevention rather than having to spend a major amount of money currently needed to effect a good cure.There are three actions that can be taken at minimal cost, the first of which being that we publicise the benefits of exercise.  Obesity is not a complicated problem.  It results from people taking in more calories than they use up.  If one exercises — walking is a simple exercise and costs no money — one can achieve great results.  Second, we could use the traffic light system in respect of food labelling, namely, green for foods that allow one to go; amber for foods that are potentially dangerous and red for foods that are dreadful.  Third, we could request the public health system to weigh at neo-natal and primary school level every child in the country and to then send home to parents the message that Johnny or Mary is 10% or 20% over weight and setting out the health risks that implies.I am aware there exists a task force dealing with this issue and that it is doing very good work.  I am interested to hear from the Minister of State what the task force is doing.  I appeal to the House to provide time to for a full debate on the huge epidemic of obesity currently threatening our country.  Some 4,000 people die every year from obesity.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1123	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who cannot be here tonight.  I thank Deputy Devins for raising this matter.The report of the national task force on obesity , Obesity the Policy Challenges, provided the policy framework for addressing the high prevalence and rising levels of overweight and obesity, in particular childhood obesity.  It attributed the development of overweight and obesity to many factors.  The involvement of this wide range of factors made it essential that a multi-sectoral approach be taken to deal with the relevant issues.  The report provided 93 recommendations of action aimed at six sectors, including central Government, the education, social and community and health sectors, food production and supply and the physical environment.An inter-sectoral group on obesity, comprising relevant Departments and key stakeholders was established early in 2009 to oversee and monitor implementation of the recommendations of the taskforce.  The group published a report in April 2009 detailing progress on each of the recommendations.  Its examination showed that significant progress was made in respect of 30 of the recommendations, partial implementation has occurred in respect of 29 and action is progressing on a further 26, leaving only eight where little progress was reported.The report indicated that while significant progress had been made across all sectors, there is a continuing need for concerted action to halt the rise in obesity.  The group also considered key priority areas for action in the short to medium term.  The group's overriding concern was the need for concerted Government action driven at the highest level to ensure a consistent approach to the implementation of the recommendations of the taskforce.  Among the areas highlighted were measures to increase physical activity among children, continued awareness programmes about the dangers of excessive consumption of foods high in fat, sugar and salt, increased control of the advertising and marketing of food and drinks aimed at children, improved training for health professionals in obesity prevention and diagnosis and counselling for those at risk of obesity.Since the April 2009 report a significant development has been the publication in 2009 of the first national guidelines on physical activity and accompanying Get Ireland Active  website. Based on best international practice, the guidelines specify the recommended levels of daily physical activity for people of all ages and abilities.  The work of the inter-sectoral group on obesity is currently being examined in the context of a wider review of policy in regard to lifestyle-related illnesses to which obesity is a major contributory factor.  Elements of this work will also be progressed in the forthcoming policy on cardiovascular disease which will be completed shortly.I have taken account of Deputy Devins's remarks in respect of the importance of the deliberations of yesterday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I will take up his request this evening for a full Dáil debate on obesity with the Minister and Whips' Office.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	I thank the Minister of State for being here this evening but I would have liked if the Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for children had come to the House to take this Adjournment matter.I regard this issue as extremely important and worrying.  We have unfortunately debated in this House in recent times a number of cases of abuse and inappropriate treatment of children in State care, often with tragic effect.  As recently as January last, just six or eight weeks ago, a young Chinese national arrived at Cork Airport from Barcelona.  She was stopped by Garda immigration officers at Cork Airport and was found to have false documentation and was put into HSE care.  She spent her first night in what is termed "emergency foster care" in Carrigaline.  She arrived at Cork Airport on 22 January and spent 23 and 24 January, which was a weekend, in emergency foster care.  On the Monday, the HSE child care services in the south of the area, accompanied by a social worker, spoke to her with an interpreter as she did not speak English and decided to move her from emergency foster care into what is described as "supported lodgings", again in Carrigaline in Cork.  As I understand it, the following day, 26 January, she left the lodgings to walk down the main street of Carrigaline and has not been seen since.  This is another case of a child in HSE care — her nationality is not the main issue — who has gone missing.  She is a child who was in the State's care and she is now missing.  No one knows where she is.There are seven cases involving Chinese children between the ages of 16 and 17 years who have during the past 12 months gone missing while in State care.  If one visits the missingkids.com website and searches for children who have gone missing during the past 12 months, one will see all of the photographs and names, of which there are 12, on the list of missing children.  They are all girls, seven of whom are Chinese.  What is happening that we can allow young Chinese girls to come into Ireland illegally, put them into State care and allow them to disappear without trace?  This is what has happened for the first time in Cork.  It happened on a street outside my constituency office.  I spoke in detail about this matter with officials from the HSE today.  They were open in regard to the procedures they put in place and are insistent they applied the appropriate protocol required of them in terms of initially putting this child into emergency foster care and then moving her into supported accommodation.  That standard practice is not good enough.  We have now allowed a child, the responsibility of this State, to disappear.Perhaps this child was trafficked; perhaps not.  We do not know.  The evidence suggests that given the number of young girls who have disappeared, all of whom come from the same country, China, and were in State care, that there is something seriously awry that we need to resolve.  The reality is that this girl could be in the basement of a brothel somewhere in Ireland or Britain.  This girl was in State care and after only four days she went missing.  If this were an Irish 16 year old from Carrigaline, Crosshaven or Cork city, there would be a national outcry to find her.  Yet, because this girl and the other six young girls who have gone missing without trace, are Chinese nationals, there is no significant political crisis or requirement to change practise to ensure we do not allow this to happen again.I want the Government to give me a comprehensive answer as soon as possible, to explain how this has happened, what are its consequences and what the State is now doing to locate this child to ensure that she is not being exploited or abused.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1125	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The HSE is not in a position to provide information in respect of the issue raised by the Deputy, due to ongoing industrial action.  In the absence of such information, I will set out the current policy position on unaccompanied minors.The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum relating to accommodation, medical and social needs, as well as their application for refugee status, are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and the Child Care Act 1991.Where separated children are identified by the Garda Síochána at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, he or she is placed in the care of the HSE.  Where a separated child is in the company of an adult and there are concerns about his or her welfare, then he or she is also placed in the care of the HSE.Research indicates that the tendency to equate all missing children with trafficked children is unsubstantiated.  Some of the missing individuals are recorded as children on the basis of their referral to the out of hours social work service, but there is substantial operational experience to indicate that some of these individuals may be adults, as they have disappeared before a comprehensive age assessment process could be conducted by the dedicated social work team for unaccompanied minors.

The fact that he has compared this case to six other cases is quite serious.  I cannot be specific because of the industrial action, but I do not want to hide behind that.

The following recommendation was presented to the area committee on 20 April 2008 by a conservation officer and planner for Dublin City Council.The chapel at Saint James's Hospital is considered to be of a certain level of architectural significance and consequently of local importance.  It is also considered to be of sufficient social and historical value within the meaning of Part 4 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to merit inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures.This was an unequivocal recommendation that it should be placed on the record, and it was passed by the south central area committee at the meeting of May 2008.  Procedure requires that a public notice is placed in the newspapers giving notice of the intention to add the building to the list of protected structures.  This was done on 3 July 2008.  One submission was received requesting that the structure should not be added to the record of protected structuresA report was then prepared for the city council and signed off on by the assistant city manager on 21 August 2008.  This report included a recommendation from the area committee to add the building to the list of protected structures.  On 25 August 2008, a letter from a Dublin City Council conservation officer was forwarded to an executive manager of Dublin City Council, stating that a "recommendation to add this building to the record of protected structures on grounds of historical association is insufficient to warrant inclusion".  A decision was taken by a city council official or officials not to proceed with the process.  From correspondence received under the Freedom of Information Act, a letter dated 10 September 2008 was sent to the CEO of Saint James's Hospital by a senior planner in Dublin City Council, stating that "it has been decided not to proceed with the proposed addition to the record of protected structures in relation to the above, as it would be premature pending the formulation of an agreed Master Plan for Saint James's Hospital".What is the basis on which Dublin City Council officials decided, without reference to the elected representatives, to take this decision?  The addition or deletion of a building on the record of protected structures is a reserved function of democratically elected city councillors.  This means that only they can make a decision.  In this case, the non-elected city council officials unilaterally made a decision not to include this item on the agenda of the full city council meeting.  Why did they do this?  On whose authority did they do this?  The city council officials refuse to answer these questions, so now I am requesting the Minister to get this information and put it in the public domain.Saint James's Hospital has stated that the chapel impedes development of the site, which contains the largest hospital in the State.  However, the proposal for development of the site is not to extend the availability of services for the public, but rather to build a private hospital on the grounds of the public hospital.  Meanwhile, the developer has been given planning permission by Dublin City Council to go ahead with the building of the private hospital, subject to a number of conditions.  This decision has been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  This is a hospital that will not be available to all the citizens from Dolphins Barn down to Kildare.  The recommendation of Dublin City Council planners is that the chapel is to be demolished to allow the building of a private hospital, available to those who can pay for the privilege.The city council has given a series of answers to Councillor John Gallagher, none of which addresses the questions posed.  This attitude, combined with the decision to grant planning permission, is simply not acceptable.  The Minister needs to undertake an inquiry or, alternatively, commission the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake an urgent investigation.I have listed a number of days, dates, records and so on.  In summary, the conservationist from the council made an initial recommendation and then reversed it, following a submission from the hospital.  The assistant city manager failed to bring a recommendation of the area committee to the full council.  A developer now has planning permission to demolish the chapel, and the building can go ahead without reference to the elected representatives.  This procedure flies in the face of democracy and needs to be investigated.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1130	I am replying on behalf of the senior Minister.  Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, each planning authority is required, for the purpose of protecting structures or parts of structures which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, to include a comprehensive record of protected structures in its development plan.  The making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities.The Act also enables the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make recommendations to a planning authority concerning the inclusion of specific structures in its record of protected structures, and a planning authority must have regard to any such recommendations.  These recommendations are based on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, NIAH, surveys conducted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The aim of the NIAH surveys is generally to include structures which are of international, national and regional importance.The initial scoping of the NIAH survey for Dublin City has commenced.  The survey will represent a significant undertaking and considerable further planning is required.A planning authority must decide whether a structure is worthy of inclusion in the record of protected structures by identifying the characteristics of special interest which would merit its inclusion.  The Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities issued by the Department indicate features that may contribute to the character and special interest of a structure.  The guidelines also set out criteria that should be applied when selecting proposed protected structures for inclusion in the record of protected structures.  There are also a number of means by which planning authorities can identify structures of special interest within their functional areas including the national inventory of architectural heritage surveys and inventories carried out by the planning authorities themselves.As regards the assessment of structures of local interest, it is the responsibility of the planning authority to make its own assessment of the most appropriate way to protect structures that have not been inspected by the NIAH or that have been given a rating of local importance by the inventory.On foot of a request by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Dublin City Council has provided details to the Department as to the sequence of events in connection with the listing procedure it had initiated for inclusion of the chapel at St. James's Hospital in its record of protected structures; the listing was subsequently not progressed.  Further information on this matter is being sought by the Department from the city council.

The statement emphasises the importance of this as the needs of society and the citizen require better collaboration, joint planning and service delivery between the different sectors and organisations in the public service. A more integrated service will be united by its common objectives to achieve the priorities identified by Government.  The need is identified to be able to redeploy people in one part of the public service from activities which are no longer priorities, towards new challenges which are often in other areas. This means breaking down the barriers to mobility (organisational, sectoral, professional and geographical) between the different parts of the public service. These are issues which will require negotiation with the public service unions.In late 2009, discussions took place with the public service unions seeking agreement on arrangements to apply where staff were to be redeployed across the civil and public service.  The discussions were part of the agenda of the wider Partnership Talks and had progressed to an advanced stage prior to the breakdown of those talks last December.  While the current industrial relations environment has limited the scope to redeploy resources to priority areas my Department will continue to seek progress with the staff side on advancing the redeployment agenda. However, some progress continues to be made in relation to the voluntary movement of staff.

In particular, the Deputy will be aware that I mentioned in my address that €2bn out of an overall €3bn adjustment for 2011 would have to be achieved from reducing the cost of public services and reform of how we tax income.  Given that I indicated there was "little or no scope for increases in marginal income tax rates", it will be necessary to examine other ways of broadening our tax base.The Deputy will be aware that the Government has successfully introduced a levy on second homes which yielded of the order of €60 million in 2009. The introduction of a more general property tax represents a major structural change in the tax system and any such development would have to be considered in light of the overall tax burden on individuals, the need for base broadening measures and current market conditions. The form of taxation on property will have specific regard to the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government to introduce a Site Valuation Tax for non-agricultural land, following the necessary valuation and registration process.In terms of water charges, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government informed the House on 10th December 2009 that he would be bringing forward proposals as a priority for the installation of water meters in households. These proposals, which the Minister is currently finalising, will give effect to the commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water use in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. I understand that the Minister’s proposals will include draft legislation to remove the prohibition on charging for domestic water services while also addressing arrangements for the delivery of the metering programme, cost estimates and how these costs are to be financed, as well as plans for the development of a pricing structure for domestic water services.  Further details on these matters will be made available following their consideration and approval by Government.The introduction of a metered charging regime for water services will promote increased conservation of water resources.  Reducing consumption will help to reduce the very significant costs currently being faced by local authorities in providing supplies of high quality drinking water and treating waste water discharged into the public sewerage system.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1133	The current work to rule and other actions are part of a programme of industrial action undertaken by public service unions across the public sector. The industrial action is in response to the pay reductions imposed by the Government on public servants with effect from 1 January last as part of the Government's budgetary strategy to bring the public finances under control.There are ongoing informal contacts between Public Service management and unions in relation to the conduct of the present industrial action. These contacts form part of well-established channels of communication with representatives of the trade unions in the Public Service. Beyond these operational contacts, the Government believes it would be desirable that both public service unions and management would engage in relation to the wider transformation agenda and the future development of public services and public service employment. In order to reach a more formal and substantive process of engagement with the Unions, there needs to be a shared understanding of the parameters of any engagement and a willingness to explore what potential exists within those parameters. Public Service management will continue to seek a basis on which substantive discussions can take place with the public service unions and I would urge the unions to participate in meaningful engagement on the challenges facing the public service.Any industrial action, whatever form it takes, is regrettable, in particular when it impacts on service delivery to the public.  Everything possible is being done by management to minimise any impact. Nevertheless, the proposed escalation in the industrial action which was announced by the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Monday last will inevitably adversely impact on service delivery across the public service. While the right of employees to take industrial action can be acknowledged, this has to be tempered by the obligation to provide a service to the citizen and taxpayer who provide the resources to fund our public services. I firmly believe that the legitimate concerns of public servants will not be advanced in any way through industrial conflict and that our collective responsibility for the provision of public services to the taxpayer must be adhered to.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1134	In the first instance it is a matter for the financial institutions themselves to consider and determine their strategic arrangements, subject of course to necessary regulatory, competition and other relevant requirements. Regarding the State's role, its primary consideration continues to be to protect, in the public interest, the financial and economic system of the State.  Where public support is provided to individual institutions, either in the form of participating in NAMA or by way of the provision of capital, such institutions will be required to prepare and submit restructuring plans to the EU Commission.  So far, re-structuring plans have been submitted by Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and AIB and, in due course, re-structuring plans will also be required from the two building societies.I fully support the idea of a reformed and reinvigorated banking system that can serve our economy in a proper manner and within which there is scope for all credit institutions operating in the Irish market to play their full part.  The Central Bank and the Financial Regulator are also significant stakeholders in the future shape of the financial system and their views are important.  I will continue to encourage all institutions to examine, separately or jointly, how they can meet their capital or funding needs and develop business models to support economic development.  I will consider all or any options presented to me and, insofar as possible, play a positive role in supporting the delivery of viable plans consistent with competition and State aid requirements.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1135	I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 106 and 157 together.The end-February Exchequer Returns, published on 2 March, were generally in line with expectations.  At end-February 2010, the Exchequer deficit was €2,407 million compared to €2,085 million at end-February 2009.  In terms of tax revenue performance, €4,736 million in tax receipts were collected by the end of February, against a target of €4,800 million. This means that tax receipts for the first two months of the year were €64 million below target.My Department published monthly targets for tax revenue earlier this year and while tax receipts collected in the first two months were about €1 billion less than the same period last year, this had been anticipated.  A significant year-on-year decline is expected in the initial months of 2010, with tax revenues forecast to end the year 6% down on 2009, as the economy shows signs of positive growth during the second half of this year.  Total net voted expenditure at end-February 2010 was €7,191 million, representing a decline of some €800 million or 10.2% on the same period in 2009.  This significant year-on-year reduction reflects both the expenditure policy changes implemented over the past year or so and timing issues.  The Revised Estimates Volume, published on 18 February, projected a 1.9% reduction in total net voted spending for the year as a whole.The end-February Exchequer Returns show that the action taken by Government in managing the public finances is working.  At this stage of the year I have no reason to adjust the revenue targets.  My Department will, as is usual, have a press conference setting out the first quarter Exchequer Returns in early April.  The Government is committed to the targets set out in the recent Budget.  As economic growth returns during the course of the year, this will assist in the ongoing improvement in the public finances.

This bond will effectively be a new form of our state savings products which are aimed at the retail investor. We already have savings bonds and savings certificates, which are three and five and a half year investment products managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. The new bond will be a longer-term product which will be attractive to people who wish to invest for up to 10 years. Where an investor wishes to encash their investment before the final maturity date of 10 years they will be able to do so.The structure is quite innovative — there will be an annual interest payment and a final redemption bonus payable. The final investment bonus will be payable to investors who encash their bonds after five, seven or ten years.  Legislative provisions relating to the introduction of the National Solidarity Bond are included in the Finance Bill which is expected to become law by early April. I expect that, by mid-April 2010, information on the Bond will be available in Post Offices, on the internet and by telephone and that the Bonds themselves will be available for purchase in any Post Office.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1137	There are basically two categories of charges applied by the banks — interest-related banking charges and non-interest-related banking charges and fees.  Interest-related banking charges are determined by the banks themselves on the basis of market considerations and neither the Minister for Finance nor the Financial Regulator would have any statutory role in this matter. In setting the level of such charge for a borrower, a bank would have regard to a variety of factors such as the customer's credit history, the risk perceived to attach to the loan, the cost of funds to the bank, competition considerations etc.The increase in the interest rates on some personal loans and overdrafts reflects the commercial market realities which the bank faces. Basically, the bank must pay more to access the funds which it uses to operate.  Although the ECB base rate remains at historic lows, the level of interest rates also depends on a broad range of factors including deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, an institution's overall funding.  With regard to the impact on Irish families of these changes, it is self evident that any increase in interest rates will have a negative impact on the disposable income of households.  The Government has through a number of measures, including the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the moratorium on home repossessions, sought to ease the burden of the recession for the most vulnerable members of Irish society.  However, I do not have any function in the day to day running of the recapitalised banks and have no role in setting interest rates.The regulation of non-interest-related banking charges/fees is vested in the Financial Regulator and credit institutions are obliged to seek the prior approval of the Regulator before any increase in such fees. In fact, Ireland is the only EU country with statutory control on such fee increases. If the increased charge to which the Deputy is referring falls within this category, then it will, as I have indicated, have received the prior approval of the Financial Regulator.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1138	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes was published in July 2009 and outlined 271 recommendations with potential savings of up to €5.3 billion in a full year along with associated staffing reductions of over 17,300 in public service numbers.  Following the publication of the Special Group’s Report, which is advisory in nature, the Government referred the Report to each Government Department with instructions to examine recommendations relevant to their Department as a major input to the Estimates process for 2010.  In parallel with this, my Department also closely examined the Report for the same purpose.  Accordingly, the Special Group’s analysis and recommendations have been taken into account in the 2010 Budget and the Estimates of Expenditure for the year ahead.  The formulation of policy in regard to the 2010 Estimates involved discussions and consultations between my Department and other Departments, as is normal.  Implementation of all Estimates decisions, including those arising from the Report of the Special Group, is the responsibility of the relevant Minister and Department.In summary, the Government decided to implement 32 recommendations in full and 89 in part.  In aggregate terms, these savings are estimated to yield some €1.7 billion in 2010 and €1.9 billion in a full year, with savings implemented by the Department of Social and Family Affairs accounting for an estimated €691 million in 2010 and €739 million in a full year.  On that basis, aggregate savings outside of those related to the Department of Social Welfare amount to €1.06 billion in 2010 and €1.17 billion in a full year.  The 2010 figure therefore represents 90% of the non-Social Welfare full year savings.The Report of the Special Group will continue to be a central point of reference in the Government's ongoing consideration of overall expenditure strategy and structural reform across the public service, and the recommendations of the Report continue to receive active consideration across all Departments in this regard.  There are no plans to reconvene the Special Group in 2011.  Comprehensive details on the 2010 Estimates of Expenditure are set out in the 2010 Budget documentations and in the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume, which was published on 18 February 2010.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1139	I indicated last September that, following the transfer of eligible bank loans to NAMA, it is likely that institutions will require additional capital and that each institution should explore all available options, both internal and external, for raising such capital.  However, I also stated that, to the extent that the institutions are not in a position to raise sufficient capital from such sources, the Government remains committed, consistent with EU rules, to providing relevant banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to enable them to continue to meet their regulatory requirements.In light of its responsibilities for the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive, the Financial Regulator is currently assessing the capital requirements arising for those credit institutions participating in NAMA to ensure that the banking system in Ireland meets appropriate regulatory standards and market expectations.  In general terms, the impact of any future bank recapitalisation on the Exchequer, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the General Government Balance will depend on the scale and source of the recapitalisation funds and the basis on which capital is provided and, therefore, cannot be specified at this point.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	The Deputy will appreciate that the named covered institution is run as an arm's length operation and as such it is not appropriate for me to comment on how it manages its pricing strategies.  I have stated publicly that I was disappointed by recent decisions and announcements by covered institutions to increase their variable interest rates but unfortunately such increases reflect commercial market realities including the increased cost of accessing funds.The Guarantee means that the covered institutions can in fact raise funds more cheaply than they otherwise would. This is a benefit to all of their customers. All covered institutions pay the State for the costs of the Guarantee.  Interest rates are at historically low levels and are likely to remain very low for the foreseeable future in overall terms and this has provided significant support for customers in the current challenging economic and financial environment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	I have requested the Financial Regulator to carry out this Strategic Review of the Credit Union Sector in Ireland.  The Project is being managed by the Registrar of Credit Unions and my officials are to liaise closely with him throughout the project.  With regard to progress, the Registrar has received expressions of interest and is in the process of finalising the Tender Document.  He will then issue an invitation to tender to a short-list of tenderers.  It is anticipated that the selection process will be completed by end-May 2010 and work will begin shortly thereafter.  I expect to have a report on the full project by end-March 2011.The Terms of Reference has not yet been finalised.  The Registrar and my officials have had detailed discussions on a draft Terms of Reference.  The final Terms of Reference will reflect any modifications required following dialogue with the selected consultancy firm.  I am confident that the Financial Regulator will execute the project in accordance with public procurement guidelines and that the best techniques in project management will be utilised.When I requested the Financial Regulator to carry out this review, it was in the knowledge that a review of credit union legislation is somewhat overdue.  The Credit Union Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the regulation of credit unions. The Act was designed to provide the credit union movement with a regulatory structure that reflects and promotes the particular ethos and philosophy of the credit union movement, its strong tradition of volunteer service and the core objective of providing opportunities for saving and lending for members of credit unions.  The approach to regulation embodied in the Credit Union Act 1997 has served the credit union movement well by providing clarity and certainty to individual credit unions, their directors and members. It has helped support the continued stability of the credit union movement and safeguard the members' savings during a period of rapid growth.In relation to the further development of the credit union sector, the outcomes for this project will be to develop proposals and make recommendations for a modern credit union operational model, supported by an appropriate and enabling legislative and regulatory framework.  This framework must reflect the needs of the credit unions and their members.  It should be able to support the development of movement into the future.

The working group has been established and the members comprise, in the first instance, representatives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Defence, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  As soon as the draft Terms of Reference have been finalised, the working group will be convened, and it is envisaged that a report will be ready for government within six months.

I always made it clear that the actual valuation will be determined on a loan by loan basis. Only after a significant number of loan-by-loan valuations have been carried out will it be possible to get a full sense of the overall discount.  I am advised by NAMA that issues have arisen during the due diligence process regarding the quality of legal title and related matters. Clearly this justifies the thorough and detailed due diligence process undertaken by NAMA.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1144	As the Deputy will be aware a detailed and comprehensive legal and regulatory framework is in place in Ireland for the regulation and supervision of the financial services sector.  This framework is underpinned by an extensive series of EU Directives governing the conduct of financial services activities on a cross-border basis within the single EU market.  Clearly, an effective system of enforcement is central to the effectiveness of any system of financial supervision.  Under the statutory framework which established the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, the Financial Regulator was conferred with significant powers to impose sanctions for prescribed contraventions of legislation or regulatory rules.The Financial Regulator has wide-ranging powers to conduct an examination where it suspects that a regulated financial service provider and/or person concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider has committed a ‘prescribed contravention'. If the examination  concludes that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there is or has been a prescribed contravention, the Financial Regulator can establish an inquiry.  The inquiry shall decide if the prescribed contravention has occurred and determine the appropriate sanctions.  The legislation provides that, at any time up to the conclusion of an inquiry, the Financial Regulator may enter into a binding settlement agreement with a regulated financial service provider and/or a person concerned in its management to resolve the matter.  Where a financial services firm or individual enters into such an agreement early in the pursuit of a sanctions case, the terms of the settlement will reflect the savings in time, resources and money that would result.  Administrative Sanctions Procedure decisions can be appealed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.My Department has been advised that the Financial Regulator has concluded 26 enforcement actions since it received the legislative powers to do so.  Seven people have been disqualified from being involved in the management of regulated financial services providers (for various periods of time) and one person stepped down as a director.  Seven of the firms sought the voluntary revocations of their authorisations. In addition to the powers available to the Financial Regulator under the Administrative Sanctions regime, specific criminal offences are provided for under various national and EU legal instruments where a breach of regulatory requirements might arise. For instance, certain offences under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive are punishable in Ireland by up fines up to €10m and/or up to 10 years imprisonment. The same punishments also apply in the case of other EU legislation.Clearly, in restoring the reputation of the regulatory system through the reform of our regulatory structures, it will be a priority for the Government to ensure that any measures required to strengthen the powers of enforcement available to the new Central Bank of Ireland to ensure that a credible and robust enforcement regime is in place for the future. In that regard, my Department is in discussion with the Financial Regulator, now headed by Mr. Matthew Elderfield, and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, to which Dr. Patrick Honohan has recently been appointed as Governor, to assess possible areas of improvement to its enforcement powers and supervisory resources with a view to including appropriate provisions in forthcoming legislation on the restructuring of the Central Bank.

At all times I have stated that more accurate figures would be available only after participating institutions fully identified their eligible loans and these had been subjected to independent valuation.Based on the assessment of applications from the five participating institutions, approximately €80 billion of loans have been identified as eligible for transfer to NAMA. The consideration to be paid for these loans will depend on valuations, determined by the application of the valuation methodology approved recently by the EU Commission, of each of the eligible loans. Also, section 84 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is not obliged to acquire any eligible asset on any grounds. It is my intention to provide a more detailed breakdown later this month.  I should point out that Section 50 of the NAMA legislation places a limit of €54 billion on the consideration to be paid for the loans regardless of the nominal amounts involved. This limit can only be amended by a positive resolution by the Dáil. I have no intention of adjusting this figure at this time.

NAMA have set this date as 30 November 2009. It follows that any property decreases or increases after 30 November 2009 will not be reflected in the NAMA market valuations.  Valuation will be in accordance with recognised red book valuation standards, European valuation standards, or International valuation standards, as appropriate to the locations where the property is situated. The valuation process for the eligible bank assets will be certified by independent experts and validated by the Financial Regulator to ensure that the NAMA valuation methodology is robust and credible.

Normally, positions are filled in the latter way, but since the establishment of TLAC, 3 posts at the grade of Secretary General, 3 at the grade of Deputy Secretary and 37 at the grade of Assistant Secretary have been filled by way of open competition.  Since the beginning of 2007, 42 posts have been filled by way of open competition. Out of those 42 posts, 2 were filled by people from outside of the civil service, 2 were filled by people from the wider public service and 5 were filled from outside the appointing Departments.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1149	I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 95 together.The second Mazars report on credit availability, published in December, confirmed that while some businesses are facing significant challenges accessing credit, and the SME sector in general is more conservative in its borrowing, nevertheless businesses surveyed confirmed that new lending is still taking place. It is noteworthy that SME businesses surveyed reported a lower level of refusals than claimed by ISME. However, the proportion of refused credit, especially in certain sectors, remains a concern for Government.I have said before that the banks should be in a better position to lend once the riskiest loans have been removed from their balance sheets and that viable businesses should expect a fair hearing when seeking funding. The banks' balance sheets will be stronger once NAMA has taken over these loans and replaced them with Government guaranteed bonds; this will give the banks greater access to liquidity and make long-term funding cheaper.To help address concerns over credit availability, under the NAMA Act I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks. I hope that banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to join the system. My aim is to have a simple, effective review process, run by people with experience and credibility. The banks must comply with the recommendations of the review process, or explain why they will not do so.In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs. This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit. I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.  Work has been ongoing since December on the logistical aspects of the review system and it is envisaged that reviews will commence shortly.

The other external members are as follows:NameMr. Matthew ElderfieldFinancial RegulatorDr. David DuffyESRIMr. Pat FarrellIrish Banking Federation (IBF)Mr. Tom FoleyIrish Banking Federation (IBF)Mr. Paul JoyceFree Legal Advice Centre (FLAC)Ms. Patricia T. Rickard-ClarkeLaw Reform Commission (LRC)Mr. Brendan BurgessIndependent ConsultantThe Group will also include senior officials of the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Justice Equality and Law Reform, Social and Family Affairs, Communications Energy and Natural Resources, and Environment Heritage and Local Government.  I am satisfied that the external members of the Group have the relevant expertise in areas relating to mortgage arrears and personal debt.  In addition to the expertise of its own members the Group will be calling on others to provide it with material, covering all relevant areas, and this will naturally include the experiences of MABS in dealing with homeowners in arrears.  The revamped Group had its first meeting on March 5th and is finalising the terms of reference. In general, the terms of reference will reflect the commitments made by the Government both in the Renewed Programme for Government and in subsequent Government decisions relating to the issues of mortgage arrears and personal debt.The Group will focus initially on bringing forward recommendations in dealing with the mortgage arrears problem and will later address the personal debt issue. I expect that these recommendations will be made to me on a rolling basis as the Group progresses with its review. I will then consider the merits of each of the recommendations before deciding on whether to submit to Government for decision.  The Deputy will be aware that the Financial Regulator recently published data on mortgage arrears for the period ended December 2009.  As at December 2009, 28,603 mortgage accounts were in arrears for more than 90 days, of which 19,185 were more than 180 in arrears.  It should be noted that the number of mortgage accounts is greater than the number of mortgaged homes by 20% or more.All estimates of the extent of negative equity appear to be based on very general economic assumptions, but it is very difficult to assess realistic price levels when property market activity remains low. In any event, being in negative equity does not change the level of mortgage payments, so the problems it may cause are more long-term and should be considered on that basis. The Financial Regulator has estimated that only a small proportion of borrowers with the covered institutions who are in negative equity are in arrears on their payments.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1151	I presume the Deputy's question relates to the increase in pension age for future recruits to the public service announced in Budget 2010. A retirement age of 70 years is to be introduced as part of the new arrangements also but, as the Deputy will be aware, this is in the context of no retirement age applying to public servants recruited after 1 April 2004.  With regard to the matter of the increase in pension age, I would point out that this is one of a number of public service pension reform measures announced in the Budget. A key objective of this initiative is to secure sustainable, affordable and controllable public service pension costs in the medium to long term while ensuring that the Government and State continue to provide fair and adequate pensions in retirement.As acknowledged in the National Pensions Framework,  the task of financing increasing pension spending will, in future, fall on a diminishing share of the population. The proposals contained in the Budget are firmly supportive of the broader reform agenda in the Framework document.  The new single public service pension scheme outlined in the Budget contains a provision to apply a minimum pension age of 66 years to future recruits. This provision will, henceforth, be linked to the State Pension age. The projected long run annual savings from this measure are estimated, in constant 2010 terms, at 500m euro.  As indicated in the Budget, the details of the new scheme will be considered by Government following consultation between my Department and public service employers and unions. This process is well under way and it is intended to enact the necessary legislation so as to have the new arrangements in place by the end of the year.

The CFRAM Programme underpins the essentials of the assessment of flood risk and the long-term planning risk assessment measures for the River Shannon catchment and other catchment areas throughout the country and includes capital, structural and non-structural measures.  The CFRAM Programme is being delivered through the CFRAM Studies.  The CFRAM studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies, which focus on and identify areas at risk from flood events for a range of severities and to produced a prioritised plan of measures and actions for dealing with areas where the risk is significant.The Shannon FRAM study, which is expected to commence in mid-2010, will involve consultation with all of the main stakeholders, including the public, the ESB, Waterways Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service and relevant Local Authorities.  The study will look at all options for dealing with areas of significant flood risk.  The objective of this exercise is to determine relative roles and define relative responsibilities of all the main bodies involved with the Shannon, with a view to ensuring that all flood risk factors are identified and managed in a coordinated way.The CFRAM Programme meets the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and the Flood Directive, which provide for a framework for a coordinated approach to the management of the river catchment systems.  The EU Floods Directive is in the process of being transposed in Irish Law at present and by which OPW will be appointed as the Competent Authority to meet the requirements of the Directive.  This legislation will reinforce the role of OPW in coordinating the management of the CFRAM programme.

I hope that banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to join the system. My aim is to have a simple, effective review process, run by people with experience and credibility. The banks must comply with the recommendations of the review process, or explain why they will not do so.In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs. This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit. I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.  Mr John Trethowan, an experienced banker with a demonstrated commitment to public and social service, is overseeing the establishment of this credit review system with initial administrative support from Enterprise Ireland.  Work has been ongoing since December on the logistical aspects of the review system and it is envisaged that Mr. Trethowan will be in a position to commence reviews shortly.

In setting the fees account was taken of the critical importance of the work to be undertaken by the Board and the fact that its workload will be excessive by normal standards in the first year of operation. I intend to review the fees after a year.Chairperson — all inclusive fee of €170,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent is available without restriction.Chairperson of Credit Committee — all inclusive fee of €150,000 per annum on the understanding that the incumbent works no less than 3 to 4 days a week.Ordinary Board Members — fee of €50,000 per annum. Chair of other Committees — fee of €10,000 per annum in addition to Ordinary Board Member fee subject to a maximum of one per member.The Board was appointed on 22 December 2009.  Originally, the fees for the Chairperson and Ordinary Board Members were set at €100,000 and €38,000 respectively. Following discussions with the Chairperson and the Chief Executive of the National Treasury Management Agency last month and in light of the workload of the Board's operations over the initial period of its operation I revised these fees from a current date.

This scheme was introduced following the collapse of Lehmann Brothers and the following liquidity crisis of September 2008.  However, the funding situation of Irish banks has improved dramatically in the intervening period and the blanket guarantee will no longer be necessary into the future.A key feature of the new ELG Scheme introduced in December 2009 is access to longer-term funding, which is in line with the mainstream approach in the EU and is expected to contribute significantly to supporting the sustainable funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability. The structure of the ELG Scheme allows participating institutions to issue both guaranteed and unguaranteed liabilities, which will help reduce their reliance on State support over time as financial market conditions continue to improve.  AIB, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS, Irish Life & Permanent and the Irish Nationwide Building Society and named subsidiaries are the participating institutions in ELG.  Deposits covered by the ELG Scheme at the end of February stood at €108bn, while debt covered by ELG was €37bn.  The NTMA provide a comprehensive list on their website of securities which are guaranteed under ELG.

There are also substantial provisions in the Act dealing with transparent reporting by NAMA and oversight of NAMA by the Oireachtas. The Act provides for NAMA to submit to me quarterly reports, which I shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas, as well as sending a copy to a Committee appointed by the Oireachtas to deal with NAMA. The publication of a Business Plan is a matter for the Board of NAMA which was appointed in December 2009. I am aware that the Board proposes to review the draft Business Plan published in October 2009 in the light of the extensive due diligence process currently under way and that any update to the Plan will be informed by the valuation of loans being transferred over the coming months.  I am advised by NAMA that the NAMA Board proposes to publish a revised Business Plan by the 30th June 2010.

The Bank of Ireland Plan was submitted to the Commission on 30 September 2009. The Allied Irish Banks Plan was submitted on 13 November 2009 and the Anglo Irish Bank Plan was submitted on 30 November 2009.  Considerable discussion, dialogue and exchange of information is continuing as the Commission undertake their assessment of the restructuring plan in line with the applicable state aid rules. It is too early to speculate on how long this process will take and when final approval of the restructuring plans for the institutions will be granted by the Commission.

In outline terms, therefore, the deduction applies to public servants who are employed by or hold an office or position in a public service body and are members of a public service pension scheme.  I do not have the data requested by the Deputy but my understanding is that, in general, all staff in the public service who are employed on a contract of service are now eligible for admission to pension schemes. In this context a person who is on a contract and, for example, is in receipt of a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme, would be liable for the deduction.

Also, Section 59 of the NAMA Act makes provision for the Chairperson and CEO of NAMA to appear before a Committee of the Oireachtas to examine matters relating to NAMA if requested to do so.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1162	As the Deputy will be aware, €4bn in capital was provided to Anglo in 2009 from Exchequer funds, to protect the economy from the wider losses that would have occurred in the event of a failure of the bank, to protect the deposit base of the bank, and to prevent the bank becoming a systemic threat to the financial system. As I stated in my Second Stage speech on the NAMA Bill on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. I also made clear in the speech to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally that the Government remains committed to providing such institutions with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.Based on the information provided by me in mid-September to this House, the scale of Anglo's NAMA-eligible loans are such that they will give rise to a further capital requirement for the State. I am currently assessing the scale of any further capital support for Anglo Irish Bank in the light of the emerging accounting end year financial position of the bank, and the likely impact of the NAMA transfers over the course of 2010.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1163	The Deputy will appreciate that the named covered institutions are run as arm's length operations and as such it is not appropriate for me to comment on how they manage their pricing strategies.  Given the need for all credit institutions at the moment to increase their deposit taking base in order to bolster their funding bases, competition for savings in the Irish market has led to an increase in interest rates paid to savers. I do not expect that the underlying conditions which led to this rise will change dramatically in the near future.I have stated publicly that I was disappointed by recent decisions and announcements by covered institutions to increase their variable interest rates but unfortunately such increases reflect commercial market realities including the increased cost of accessing funds.  Increasing costs of deposit interest rates being one of them.  The Guarantee means that the covered institutions can in fact raise funds more cheaply than they otherwise would.  This is a benefit to all of their customers.  All covered institutions pay the State for the costs of the Guarantee.  Interest rates are at historically low levels and are likely to remain very low for the foreseeable future in overall terms and this has provided significant support for customers in the current challenging economic and financial environment.

In order to compete internationally it is essential that we ensure that all our cost pressures are kept under control.  In this regard, domestically-driven costs such as rents must reflect the new economic realities that all in business face.  While I have no specific legislative role with regard to commercial rents, what I would like to see is the necessary appropriate price adjustments taking place, thus ensuring that the competitive position of business is improved at all stages.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1166	The second Mazars report on credit availability, published in December, confirmed that while some businesses are facing significant challenges accessing credit, and the SME sector in general is more conservative in its borrowing, nevertheless businesses surveyed confirmed that new lending is still taking place. However, the proportion of refused credit, especially in certain sectors, remains a concern for Government.  It should be noted that Central Bank figures for lending are net of provisions against possible loan losses.  The most recent monthly statistics, which cover January 2010, note that just over half of the annual decline in headline private sector credit is as a result of valuation effects, such as write-downs of loans and increased bad debt provisions.I have said before that the banks should be in a better position to lend once the riskiest loans have been removed from their balance sheets and that viable businesses should expect a fair hearing when seeking funding.  The banks' balance sheets will be stronger once NAMA has taken over these loans and replaced them with Government guaranteed bonds; this will give the banks greater access to liquidity and make long-term funding cheaper.To help address concerns over credit availability, under the NAMA Act I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks.  I hope that banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to join the system.

In its analysis and consideration of the matter, the Regulator has had the benefit of external assistance regarding the financial position of some institutions.  I have kept in touch with the Regulator and when the figures are finalised I will consider the implications for the institution and any financial support that might be needed.

This Group met on two occasions.  On 25th February 2010 after consultations with my Cabinet colleagues, I informed the Government of my proposals to expand the membership of the Group to include external experts, under the independent Chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney an insolvency accountant, and to extend the remit to include personal debt.The other external members of the Group are as follows:NameMr. Matthew ElderfieldFinancial RegulatorDr. David DuffyESRIMr. Pat FarrellIrish Banking Federation (IBF)Mr. Tom FoleyIrish Banking Federation (IBF)Mr. Paul JoyceFree Legal Advice Centre (FLAC)Ms. Patricia T.

On 18 January 2010, the institution restructured its organisation by way of a scheme of arrangement with shareholders to form a new group holding company, the purpose of which is to maintain maximum flexibility in the group's corporate structure.  I have indicated publicly that I am considering all options for restructuring within the banking sector, which is an ongoing matter.  Currently I do not favour any particular option.

In general terms, the maintenance of a stock market quote for a company such as a bank allows a value to be put on its business throughout the business cycle.  A listed bank also continues to report on its performance to the market, filing its accounts and other requirements as appropriate.  Once a company de-lists from the stock market, the market valuation guide as to what that company is worth in overall terms is no longer available.  In addition, should the company become a private company the disclosure requirements for the entity may reduce.  To effect a partial or complete sale in the future of such a de-listed company, would therefore require a detailed information gathering process and valuation exercises.

Thereafter, following consideration of the reports from the Governor and Messrs Regling and Watson, I will bring proposals to Government, on the establishment of a statutory Commission of Investigation, under the provisions of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.As I made clear in my Statement on 19 January, the Oireachtas will be involved at each stage of the planned inquiry process as follows:the Finance and Public Service Committee has already met both the Governor and the independent expert at the outset of their work to be briefed on the members' priorities for investigation;the two preliminary reports, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas Committee will be invited to consider the findings of the reports;the terms of reference and draft Government Order to establish the statutory Commission of Investigation will be laid before the Oireachtas; andthe report of the Commission of Investigation will, when completed, be laid before the Oireachtas for further consideration by the Committee.  It is open to the Committee to hold public hearings on the Report.As far as the issue of the membership of the Commission of Inquiry is concerned, this matter will be considered by Government in due course.

The withdrawal of banks from the State, while regrettable, is a commercial decision for the banks themselves.  The Financial Regulator is working with both Postbank and Bank of Scotland (Ireland) Ltd. (in respect of Halifax), to ensure that consumers' interests are protected in accordance with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.An Post has a strong retail presence throughout the State with its network of computerised post offices.  Whilst the wind down of Postbank is disappointing, the underlying strengths of the network will allow An Post to develop other strategic opportunities in the financial services business.  I understand that the board and management of An Post are actively engaged in this process.  In addition, An Post offers banking services at post offices as an agent of a well known bank.

The Restructuring Plan considers all options for the future of the bank, in order to ensure that the evaluation of the plan is based on comprehensive information.  As I have noted previously, the submission of the plan by Anglo to the European Commission marked the beginning of a detailed and comprehensive evaluation process in advance of any final decision by the Commission on the plan.  This process is ongoing and involves extensive consultation and dialogue between the Commission, the Irish authorities and the bank.As part of the process, Anglo is now undertaking further detailed work in relation to the plan.  The Deputy will understand that in view of the commercial sensitivities involved it would not be appropriate for me to make public or comment on any detailed elements of the plan.  As I have stated previously, I am committed to working closely with the Commission and the bank to achieve the best possible outcome for the State from the restructuring process for Anglo Irish Bank.

The bank agreed to this request by the Commission and resolved not to pay the non-cumulative distribution on a Sterling Security, which is guaranteed and which had been due to be paid on 14 December 2009.  The effect of this decision by the bank was to trigger the ‘Dividend Stopper' provisions of the securities, which precluded it for a period of one calendar year from and including 14 December 2009, from declaring and paying certain distributions or dividends including its ordinary shares and the Irish Government €3.5 billion preference shares.The Bank would be precluded, should the ‘Dividend Stopper' remain in force, from paying the dividend due on the preference shares on 13 May 2010.  Under these circumstances, in accordance with the terms of the preference shares, the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission would become entitled to be issued with, at a date in the future, a number of ordinary shares  related to the cash amount of the dividend that would otherwise have been payable.  It is not for me to pre-empt the work of the European Commission.  It is our preference to receive the dividend so if the prohibition is lifted before that date there is scope for a cash payment.  If not, we will take ordinary shares in the bank.

I would expect that costs will be reviewed by the NAMA Board and that the estimates provided in the draft Business Plan will be updated in any revised version of the Plan.  I should point out that costs arising in 2010 from the due diligence process currently under way are recoverable from the participating institutions.  I understand also that, due to the very competitive pricing submitted as part of the various tenders, costs are likely to be substantially less than originally envisaged.  I am advised by NAMA that the NAMA Board proposes to publish a revised Business Plan by the 30th June 2010.

Basically, the bank must pay more to access the funds which it uses to operate.  Although the ECB base rate remains at historic lows, the level of interest rates also depends on a broad range of factors including deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, an institution's overall funding.With regard to the impact on Irish families of these changes, it is self evident that any increase in interest rates will have a negative impact on the disposable income of households.  The Government has through a number of measures, including the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the moratorium on home repossessions, sought to ease the burden of the recession for the most vulnerable members of Irish society.  However, I do not have any function in the day to day running of the recapitalised banks and have no role in setting interest rates.

The first of these quarterly reports is in respect of the quarter ended 31 March 2010 and is due to be submitted to me on or before 30 June 2010.  The draft Business Plan, published by the interim NAMA in October 2009, sets out certain targets and projections for NAMA.  The publication of a business plan is a matter for the Board of NAMA which was appointed in December 2009.I am aware that the Board proposes to review the Business Plan in the light of the extensive due diligence process currently under way and that any update to the Plan will be informed by information gleaned during that process and by the valuation of loans being transferred over the coming months.  I am advised by NAMA that the NAMA Board proposes to publish a revised Business Plan by the 30th June 2010.

A full exemption applies to EU ETS installations in the powergen sector, but ETS installations in other sectors will be required to comply with EU minimum excise rates.  In practice, no additional charge arises in the case of mineral oils, as the existing mineral oil tax rates all satisfy the EU minimum rates and those companies within the ETS continue to pay those minimum rates. However, implications do arise, for example, in the case of gas as it has not been taxed up to this point.  The carbon tax therefore brings gas into the tax net for the first time; consequently, the EU minimum rate is being applied.  The EU minimum rate in the case of gas is about one sixth of the carbon tax rate i.e. 54 cents per megawatt hour.  I do not consider that the application of EU minimum excise rates is in conflict with preconditions for licences granted by the EPA.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	My Department receives a range of reports on developments in the banking sector from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA. In addition, both Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland submit quarterly reports in respect of the credit packages they implemented under the terms of their respective recapitalisations. I have outlined the range of reports received in more detail in a further question submitted by the Deputy for answer today.  The second Mazars report on credit availability, published in December, confirmed that while some businesses are facing significant challenges accessing credit, and the SME sector in general is more conservative in its borrowing, nevertheless businesses surveyed confirmed that new lending is still taking place. However, the proportion of refused credit, especially in certain sectors, remains a concern for Government.To help address this concern, under the NAMA Act I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks. I hope that banks not participating in NAMA or covered by the Government guarantee will also decide to join the system. My aim is to have a simple, effective review process, run by people with experience and credibility. The banks must comply with the recommendations of the review process, or explain why they will not do so.In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs. This will help me to decide what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit. I intend to publish the analysis from the review process so that the performance of the banks participating in NAMA will be clear to all.  Mr John Trethowan, an experienced banker with a demonstrated commitment to public and social service, is overseeing the establishment of this credit review system with initial administrative support from Enterprise Ireland.  Work has been ongoing since December on the logistical aspects of the review system and it is envisaged that Mr. Trethowan will be in a position to commence reviews shortly.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	Levels of regulatory capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit and other risks that they must run are established by the so-called Basel II Framework, which was adopted in 2004, implemented in Ireland and across the EU in 2006 and which came into effect from 1 January 2008.   The Basel II Framework was agreed by members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which provides a forum for regular cooperation on banking supervisory matters.  While Ireland is not a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, we are represented by the European Commission.  Ireland considers all proposals and contributes to discussions taking place at European level on these issues.The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) implements the Basel II framework in the European Union.  The CRD comprises two directives — Directive 2006/48/EC relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions.  Irish banks are required to calculate capital requirements and maintain a minimum level of their own funds in accordance with the CRD.  Specifically, Article 75 of the Directive 2006/48/EC refers to the minimum level of own funds required. However, in relation to minimum own funds there are a number of relevant Articles including Articles 22, 109, 123, 124 and 136.I indicated last September that, following the transfer of eligible bank loans to NAMA, it is likely that institutions will require additional capital and that each institution should explore all available options, both internal and external, for raising such capital. However, I also stated that, to the extent that the institutions are not in a position to raise sufficient capital from such sources, the Government remains committed, consistent with EU rules, to providing relevant banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to enable them to continue to meet their regulatory requirements.In light of its responsibility for the implementation of the CRD, the Financial Regulator is currently assessing the capital requirements arising for those credit institutions participating in NAMA to ensure that the banking system in Ireland meets appropriate regulatory standards and market expectations.  Recent developments have demonstrated that capital requirements are at the heart of the soundness and stability of individual institutions and the financial system overall and that context, it should be noted that the CRD is already being reviewed. The European Commission is expected to make proposals to amend the CRD later this year. Therefore, in order to address issues that emerge, the CRD can be expected to evolve to cater for such situations.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1184	Anglo Irish Bank is currently preparing its accounts for the fifteen month period to 31 December 2009.  These accounts have not been finalised and it would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on these in view of the commercial sensitivities involved.  In terms of write downs, I would note that these are booked by financial institutions, based on defined accounting and legal requirements, and are impacted by a range of factors including the position of an institution's different borrowers, the financial structure and collateral position of the institution's loans, and relevant financial market conditions as well as the general economic position. Assessments on write downs are consequently a matter for each individual financial institution and its auditors, taking into account its accounting and legal obligations.Based on the information provided by me in mid-September to this House, the scale of Anglo's NAMA-eligible loans are such that they will give rise to a further capital requirement for the State.  I am currently assessing the scale of any further capital support for Anglo Irish Bank in the light of the emerging accounting end year financial position of the bank, and the likely impact of the NAMA transfers over the course of 2010.  As I stated in my Second Stage speech on the NAMA Bill on 16 September last, it is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to NAMA and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. I also made clear in the speech to the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally that the Government remains committed to providing such institutions with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements.

The purpose in establishing the NPRF was to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.The Act provided for the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission. The Commission is solely responsible for the control, management and investment of the assets of the Fund (other than assets which the Minister for Finance has directed the Commission to invest in a listed credit institution under the provisions of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009) and for determining the investment strategy for the Fund in accordance with Fund investment policy. The Commission is required to invest the assets of the Fund so as to secure the optimal total financial return, having regard to the purpose of the Fund and the eventual requirements on the Fund to make payments to the Exchequer, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission. It is open to the Commission to invest in infrastructure projects by way of participation in a public-private partnership. The Commission would of course have to satisfy itself that the investment was in accordance with its investment mandate.I note that, in a recent letter to the Committee of Public Accounts, the National Treasury Management Agency stated that infrastructure, as a long-term investment, is a natural asset class for the NPRF and that the NPRF is keen to access PPP investments where the risk/return characteristics satisfy its statutory commercial investment mandate. Moreover, I understand that recent changes to the tendering process for PPPs will facilitate NPRF involvement in PPPs. However, because of the timing of current PPP projects, a potential funding opportunity for the NPRF is not expected until at least late 2010.The letter also noted that the NPRF is committed to supporting domestic investment where the investment terms satisfy its risk and return requirements. It has had a particular focus on the venture capital sector and has to date made a total commitment of €68 million to four Irish venture capital funds.

However, I do not consider that requiring licensing through the Revenue Commissioners is the appropriate means for dealing with the issue.  The Deputy may be aware that the Government recently decided to commence a notification process, under the appropriate EC Directives, of our intention to make a Declaration Order under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 declaring certain substances, products and preparations to be controlled drugs for the purposes of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1187	The Renewed Program for Government sets out the Government's commitments for introducing new measures to protect families having difficulties with their mortgage repayments and personal indebtedness under the headings Protecting the Family Home and Helping Those in Debt.  Last November I approved the setting up of an Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Review Group, for the purpose of bringing together all relevant information in Departments and examining options in relation to the matter of support for home owners facing the problems of mortgage arrears and repossessions. This Group met on two occasions and commenced bringing forward options for dealing with the issue of mortgage arrears.I have since discussed with Cabinet colleagues proposals to revamp this Group under an independent Chair and expand it to bring in additional expertise and to extend its remit to include the issue of personal debt. On 25th February 2010, I informed the Government of my proposal to extend the membership of the Group to be chaired by Mr Hugh Cooney an insolvency accountant, along with details of the other external appointees. The revamped Group met on 5th March 2010 and will focus initially on making recommendations for dealing with the mortgage arrears problem. The personal debt issue will then be addressed.In my Budget speech in December the Government refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market, many of whom find themselves in negative equity.  Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.  The Deputy will be aware of other supports in place, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services, all of which I have spoken about extensively in this House over the past number of months.In addition, in my Budget speech, I said that I would be asking the Financial Regulator to examine extending the 6 month moratorium on legal proceedings to 12 months for all lenders. On 5 February, the Financial Regulator announced that with effect from 17 February, the Statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears has been amended to require that a regulated firm must wait at least 12 months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.As a further support, the Irish Bankers Federation, representing the mainstream lenders, published a Statement of Intent in November 2009 which provides further reassurance to homeowners who find themselves genuinely unable to maintain repayments on their principal private residence.  The Statement of Intent has been agreed and supported by all IBF members and is a welcome development.  The Law Reform Commission's Consultation Paper on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, published in September 2009, contains an extensive list of provisional recommendations for reform of the law on personal debt that includes provision for a system of non-judicial debt settlement. The Commission is aiming to have its Final Report available by end of August 2010.The Government has also approved the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Working Group on Personal Debt Management and Enforcement chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the commitment under "Helping those in Debt" envisaged in the Renewed Programme for Government.  The Working Group will agree a plan for implementation, where appropriate, of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive administrative and legislative response to the issues arising, and, determine those measures, administrative and legislative, that can be implemented in a cost efficient manner, for early effective results.The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009, provides that certain safeguards will apply to the provisions under which a court may hear an application or grant an imprisonment order against a debtor who has failed to comply with an instalment order.  The Act ensures that the court will not imprison the debtor unless it is satisfied that he has the means to pay and may also postpone the execution of an imprisonment order until such time as it thinks just.  In addition, the court will inform a debtor of the risk of imprisonment and of his entitlement to apply for legal aid.  The Act gives the court a clear power to vary the terms of an order to pay by instalments or alternatively to refer the parties for mediation.

Enterprise Ireland and Forfás have carried out examinations of loan guarantee schemes in the UK and in some other countries. Forfás, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is carrying out a further examination, and on completion of this work the Tánaiste will bring the results before Government. Any scheme developed must directly assist businesses, while at the same time safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer.

The powers and functions of the Central Bank, including section 5A(1)(b), are currently being examined in the context of the Government's programme to reform the institutional structures for regulation of financial services in Ireland and I will be bringing legislative proposals in this regard to Dáil Éireann in the near future.

It is, therefore, in the interests of all countries to reduce imbalances.  Appropriate income and fiscal policies as well as enhanced flexibility are some of the measures which can reduce imbalances and help to ensure a smoother functioning of monetary union.  This is why this Government has pursued the policy of restoring sustainability and credibility to the public finances and continues to take the necessary steps to address our high cost position which has emerged in recent years.

The Committee includes representatives of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, as well as officials from my Department and representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency as Manager of the NPRF.  I understand that the Committee's report, which is now complete, is undergoing final checking and proof reading and I expect it to be presented to me shortly.

As stated previously, the Government allocated €10m to fund a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The Scheme covers emergency income support payments to those in need and damage to a person's home and its basic essential contents such as carpets, flooring, furniture, household appliances and bedding. Structural damage may also be considered.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1195	In 2009, the Government invested €3.5bn each in AIB and Bank of Ireland in return for preference shares.  This recapitalisation programme was funded from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  €4 billion came from the Fund's current resources while €3 billion was provided by means of a front-loading of the Exchequer contributions for 2009 and 2010.   With regard to further possible State recapitalisation of either AIB or Bank of Ireland I understand that both institutions are actively exploring the option of capital raising in the private markets and this would be the Government's preferred option of raising capital.  However, I have consistently stated that should some further State recapitalisation of the banks be necessary as a result of NAMA, the Government will do this by way of equity capital.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1196	The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2009 was funded by Exchequer borrowing in 2009.  Following consultation with Eurostat, the injection was classified as a financial transaction, and therefore, did not affect the General Government Balance.  As a general rule of thumb, each €1 billion extra borrowed is estimated to cost the Exchequer about €50 million per year in interest costs.  The recapitalisations of both AIB and Bank of Ireland were made by the NPRF from their existing assets, and as such, had no impact on the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement.  As these injections were also classified as financial transactions, there was no impact upon the General Government Balance, and as the NPRF used its existing assets to make the injection.As the nature of any future recapitalisation is as yet unknown, it is not yet possible to assess exactly the effect on the Exchequer Balance and the General Government Balance.  However, it would be expected that any further capital injections into financial institutions would take the form of a financial transaction, which would be treated in the same way as previously.  In the case of the National Pension Reserve Fund, it is not possible to assess what effect any future recapitalisations may have, as the source of the funding for such recapitalisations has not yet been established.

The Deputy will be aware that the Domicile Levy is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose world-wide income exceeds €1m, their Irish-located property is greater than €5m, and their liability to Irish income tax was less than €200,000.In the Bill, it is provided that the Levy applies for the tax year 2010 and that it is payable on a self-assessment basis on or before 31st October in the year, following the valuation date which is 31st December of each year.  The first such valuation date will be 31st December of 2010 so that the first due payment of the Levy will be on or before 31st October of 2011.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide an estimate for 2010 because it will not arise in that year.In regard to a potential full year yield, the Deputy will be aware that I have previously indicated in a reply on 3rd February, 2010 on this topic to Deputy Shortall that it is not possible to estimate the number of non-residents that this measure will affect.  This was because many of the individuals who declare on their tax return that they are non-resident in the State do not have an Irish address.  Many of these non-residents are foreign nationals or have a foreign domicile; and many of the non-resident Irish citizens or Irish domiciled individuals included in this figure may have become non-resident for reasons unrelated to taxation, but have retained Irish investments (such as rental property).I am informed by Revenue that for the 2007 tax year (the latest year for which figures are available), 7,228 non-resident individuals filed Irish tax returns in respect of their Irish-source income or income derived from working here. The total amount of tax paid by these persons was c €43 million. For the 2006 tax year, 5,993 non-resident individuals filed Irish tax returns in respect of their Irish-source income or income derived from working here. The total amount of tax paid by these persons was €44.5 million.The equivalent figures for 2008 are not yet available. Returns for 2008 were due by 31 October 2009 or, in the case of returns made on ROS (Revenue Online System), by 16 November 2009. The data capture of information of these returns is currently under way and when completed will facilitate the compilation of statistics for 2008.

Both societies informed their members late last year that they would require capital and that they would be seeking this from the Government.Subsequently work has been ongoing both on the quantification of the societies capital requirements and the terms on which it would be provided through special investment shares issued by the institutions to the State.  Progress in relation to the proposed merger of the two institutions is a matter in the first instance for the respective Boards of the societies in respect of which it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment.

At present, the study is in draft form, and the extent and severe impact of the flooding in November 2009 are currently being assessed in detail for incorporation into the final version of the plan, along with the substance of submissions received in the context of the public consultation.The Catchment Flood Risk Management Plan (CFRMP) for the River Lee sets out prioritised actions and measures for the management of flood risk.  Work to advance these measures has commenced and will form part of the Office of Public Works' work programme.  The Government recognises the importance of the flood risk management programme, and the need for an appropriate level of funding.

There are substantial provisions already in the Act dealing with transparent reporting by NAMA and oversight of NAMA by the Oireachtas.  In particular, the Act provides for NAMA to submit to me quarterly reports, which I shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas, as well as sending a copy to a Committee appointed by the Oireachtas to deal with NAMA. The appointment of such a Committee is a matter for the Oireachtas.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1201	As the Deputy is aware, since 29 September 2008, the State has guaranteed certain liabilities of credit institutions in Ireland initially under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme (the ‘CIFS' Scheme) but more recently under the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme (the ‘ELG' Scheme).  The Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme, which commenced on 9 December 2009 following Oireachtas and EU State aid approval introduced important changes to the Guarantee for financial institutions bringing it more into line with the mainstream approach to similar guarantees in other EU Member States.The ELG Scheme is intended to facilitate the ability of credit institutions in Ireland to issue debt securities and take term deposits with a maturity post-September 2010 of up to five years, on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.The ECB pricing recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt apply to liabilities guaranteed under the ELG Scheme.  This is the standard pricing arrangements which now applies to all Guarantee schemes securing approval of the European Commission in line with the applicable State aid rules.  The exact remuneration payable to the State is dependent on a range of factors such as the maturity profile of the liabilities and the extent to which institutions chose to make unguaranteed issuances, however the fee will be charged at a higher rate than under CIFS. The average fee for short-term bank debt now stands at 0.5% under the new scheme.The yield to the Exchequer in respect of guarantee fees as remuneration from the institutions for the availability of the State Guarantee is expected to amount to at least €1 billion over two years from September 2008.  To date 718 million Euro has been collected from the institutions.  The fees charged to guaranteed institutions have been approved by the European Commission and help ensure the compatibility of the guarantee schemes with EC state aid requirements.  Other than in relation to the payment of these fees by the institutions participating in the guarantee schemes the issue of recouping the state aid provided under the schemes does not arise.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1202	I think it might be helpful if I outlined the various activities under the aegis of the NTMA and the governance structures underlying them.  The primary role for which the Agency was established is to ensure that sufficient funding is available at all times to meet the day-to-day requirements of the Exchequer, which involves borrowing funds as appropriate on behalf of the Exchequer and managing the Exchequer balances. The NTMA legislation provides for an Advisory Committee to advise the Agency on such matters as are referred to it by the Agency.In addition the Government has subsequently assigned, under legislation, responsibilities in a number of other areas to the NTMA in order to draw and build on its expertise in the financial area and to maximise the benefits to the State of that expertise. These other activities include :a number of related financial activities, including emissions trading, the provision of a Central Treasury Service to local authorities and non-commercial semi-state bodies and the management of the moneys in the Dormant Accounts Fund;acting as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (the NPRF Act 2000 provides that the Agency is the Manager of the Fund for at least the first ten years of the Fund's existence). The investment of the Fund is the responsibility of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and the NTMA acts as its agent in ensuring that the investment policy adopted by the Fund is implemented. The Chief Executive of the NTMA, in his role as Chief Executive of the Manager, is a member of the Commission;the management of personal injury and property management claims against the State and the underlying risks as the State Claims Agency. The Agency is assisted in these activities by a Policy Committee to advise it on policy and procedures relating to the performance of its claims management and risk management functions;the NTMA is also the body through which the National Development Finance Agency fulfils its functions.  The NDFA is a company with its own board, of which the Chief Executive of the NTMA is Chairman. The NTMA provides the staff needed by the NDFA.With regard to the measures introduced to deal with the banking crisis, NAMA is a body corporate, the board of which is responsible for ensuring that the functions of NAMA are performed effectively. The Chief Executive of the NTMA is a member of the board of NAMA and the NTMA is responsible for providing staff and business support services to NAMA. In December 2009, I introduced the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme to maintain the stability of the financial system in the State and appointed the NTMA as scheme operator.  Last month I announced the delegation of additional functions in the banking area to the NTMA.  These include: discussions with the covered institutions on their capital needs; discussions with financial institutions on realignment or restructuring within the banking sector; the management of the State's shareholding in the credit institutions, and advice on banking matters generally, including issues relating to crisis prevention, management and resolution.All of these activities are treated as separate business units within the NTMA to which staff are assigned by the NTMA.  The NTMA operates a shared services model to support the various business units.  Statutory governance arrangements for the different business units have been designed to ensure effective oversight and management at the level of the individual unit. I am satisfied that the governance structures that were developed as additional functions were assigned to the Agency will ensure the continuing effective functioning of the entities in the NTMA group and the effective pooling of the expertise and experience in the financial areas available in the NTMA.As far as funding is concerned, the NTMA has been allocated a gross budget of €60 million for 2010, as against €41 million in 2009.  In relation to Freedom of Information (FOI), the Agency is not subject to FOI because of the commercially-sensitive nature of much of its activities and, in relation to the State Claims Agency, the fact that most of its work is covered by legal privilege. As regards NAMA, it is necessary to bear in mind that NAMA will have a commercial mandate to obtain maximum value for the taxpayer and, to achieve this objective, it will be required to enter into complex commercial negotiations with financial institutions and developers, the nature of which will require in many instances a high degree of commercial confidentiality. In view of this it is not considered appropriate to extend FOI coverage to NAMA.

There are a number of factors affecting the viability of Irish business including the domestic correction in the residential construction sector along with the downturn experienced by our major trading partners as well as unfavourable exchange rate movements, particularly against sterling. In this context, appropriate economic and budgetary policies have been formulated by Government which seek to create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation, going forward.For my part, I am introducing measures under the forthcoming NAMA Act that should assist the flow of credit to viable businesses. I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have resource to independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA-participating banks. Other banks not participating in NAMA or those covered by the Government guarantee may also decide to join the system. The banks must comply with the recommendations of the appeal process or explain why they will not do so.  In addition to dealing with individual cases, the credit review system will examine credit policies and practices of the banks in respect of SMEs. This will help me decide on what further action might be necessary to secure the flow of credit which should help stem the rate of business failures as we move forward.

I have also had discussions with some representatives of proposed investors, as have the NTMA on my behalf.  I understand that some institutions have engaged in such discussions with representatives of potential investors.  To date, none of these discussions have resulted in any detailed investment proposal.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that much of this information is received in confidence and could be a market sensitive issue for the potential investors.

NAMA will purchase land and development loans and investment loans from participating credit institutions. The valuation of investment loans will incorporate assumptions about rental receipts likely to be realised on the underlying properties. However, NAMA's valuation experts, in reviewing those assumptions, must be satisfied that the rental projections are realistic and sustainable given prospective market conditions. They will not accept optimistic projections, supplied by participating institutions or by debtors, which have little prospect of being realised in the foreseeable future.

Significant measures have been introduced which make it easier for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to bid for public contracts. Among these are:the wide advertising of public procurement opportunities via the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie, which is now the established reference point for all procurement opportunitiesthe issue of email "alerts" directly to registered suppliers when contracts that might be of interest to them are advertisedthe simplification of the tendering process through the etenders website having a facility to pre-qualify tenderers and to submit tenders onlinethe provision of more training for the "professionalisation" of public purchasers. In recent years, sixty officials from forty organisations have undergone training in spend profiling and corporate procurement planning. A two year Masters qualification in Strategic Procurement is being offered by Dublin City University since September 2006 and an IPA Course is also available. Such initiatives are providing key public purchasers with the skills to appropriately promote whole of Government objectives and policies through the State's purchasing power.More recently, the National Public Procurement Operations Unit (NPPOU) was established within the Office of Public Works. The Unit is working closely with all areas of the public sector to promote efficiencies and economies in public procurement expenditure. It is acutely aware of the issues for SMEs and has commenced the process of:encouraging organisations to advertise low value contracts on etenders in order to promote SME participationin association with the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO), standardising contract and tender documentseducating SMEs through up-skilling by means of seminars/workshops/websitein association with the Department of Finance, reviewing appropriate levels of financial capacity required for public contractsworking with the CSSO and the State Claims Agency in examining the levels of public liability insurance requiredworking with Enterprise Ireland to encourage SMEs to tender for as many contracts as possibleencouraging SMEs in the use of electronic tendering on  etenders which requires no more than a personal computer and Internet access and does not involve the expense of specialist softwareencouraging early advertising upcoming procurement opportunities.Finally, my Department, in consultation with the NPPOU, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other stakeholders in the public procurement market, has developed guidance for contracting authorities on measures to facilitate SME participation in the public procurement market. This should be circulated and published shortly.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1214	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department received a redundancy lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 1 December 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from August 2009.In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.I should point out that given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for 2009 of 77,001. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for 2008 (40,607) by 90% and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;the provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and we are currently looking at ways in which additional resources can be allocated to the area in the first quarter of 2010.

The Restructuring Plan considers all options for the future of the bank, in order to ensure that the evaluation of the plan is based on comprehensive information.  As I have noted previously, the submission of the plan by Anglo to the European Commission marked the beginning of a detailed and comprehensive evaluation process in advance of any final decision by the Commission on the plan. This process is ongoing and involves extensive consultation and dialogue between the Commission, the Irish authorities and the bank.As part of the process, Anglo is now undertaking further detailed work in relation to the plan. The Deputy will understand that in view of the commercial sensitivities involved it would not be appropriate for me to make public or comment on any detailed elements of the plan.  As I have stated previously, I am committed to working closely with the Commission and the bank to achieve the best possible outcome for the State from the restructuring process for Anglo Irish Bank.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1217	Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has informed the Financial Regulator of its commercial intention to close the Halifax retail banking business and the Bank of Scotland (Ireland) intermediary business in the Republic of Ireland, commencing at the end of May 2010. The Financial Regulator is working with Bank of Scotland (Ireland) to ensure that customers' interests are protected in accordance with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code. As required by the Code all customers will be given three months notice of branch closures.I am advised by the Financial Regulator that mortgages, personal loans and fixed rate savings with the Bank will operate to maturity. Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has advised that customers do not need to do anything at this stage. The Bank's Commercial Banking and Corporate Banking operations are unaffected by this development.  Bank of Scotland (Ireland) began writing to all customers by the end of February 2010 to set out how the changes will affect them and to explain the next steps that they may need to take. The implications will vary depending on the type of account or product consumers may hold and the Financial Regulator would recommend that consumers read the details very carefully.As regards customers wishing to switch bank accounts, the Irish Bankers Federation has in place a "Personal Account Switching Code". The purpose of the Code is to make the process of switching personal accounts from one institution to another easier for consumers.  The Code is monitored for compliance by the Financial Regulator. Where consumers are switching their current account, they should contact the bank they wish to switch to (the new bank), and that bank will have all the documentation required and will make the switch on behalf of the consumer.In relation to credit card bills and bank loans, customers may switch to alternative providers where such options are available.  I understand that if a customer is not in a position to clear or switch a credit card balance by the closure date, the customer can call into their local branch or phone the Customer Service Centre to discuss and agree alternative repayment options. Bank loans will continue in accordance with the agreed term of the loan except in cases where the customer decides to repay such facilities early.

For 2009, the average rate so supplied for converting Sterling to Euro was 0.8909.  As an alternative to using this average rate, a taxpayer may, when declaring UK income on his or her tax return, use the actual rate of exchange obtained by him or her.In the case of Lloyds accounts, the rate of exchange used is that which applies at mid-market on the closing of the account at 31 December each year.  This rate is also supplied by the Central Bank and was 0.88810 at 31 December 2009. This results in £1 Sterling being equivalent to €1.1260.  The average exchange rates to be used in relation to Sterling and a number of other currencies for 2009 were issued by the Revenue Commissioners on 9 February 2010 in Revenue e-Brief No. 06/10 which is available on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act, 2009 makes provision for the reduction in the pay rates of all persons employed by public service bodies with effect from 1 January 2010.  As universities come within the definition in the Act of public service bodies, contract researchers employed by such universities are subject to the pay reductions provided for under the legislation, regardless of the source of funding for that employment.  I have no proposals to exempt persons in that position from the pay reductions.

Figures of the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services are required to be returned in income tax and corporation tax returns for the 2009 year.  The bulk of these returns are not due until late in 2010.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1227	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since the previous tax exemption scheme for stallion stud fee income ended in July 2008, stallions are treated as stock-in-trade.  This means that where the owner (including a part owner) of a stallion is carrying on the trade of farming, any profits or gains arising in respect of stallion stud services are treated as if they arise in the course of the farming trade and are charged to tax as part of the profits of that trade.  Otherwise, profits or gains arising in respect of stallion stud services are charged to tax under Case IV of Schedule D.For Irish tax purposes "farming" means farming farm land, that is, land in the State which is wholly or mainly occupied for husbandry, other than market garden land.  Subject to the provisions of the double taxation agreements in force between the State and other countries and of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, companies or individuals who are resident for tax purposes in the State are chargeable to tax here on worldwide profits or gains while companies or individuals who are non-resident in the State are chargeable to tax here only on profits or gains arising in the State.  If the Deputy has more specific information on this issue, he might forward details to the Revenue Commissioners so that they can investigate the matter.

Tax relief is also available on expenses incurred in relation to orthoptic or vision training.  Revenue has no record of having received a contact in respect of this issue in the case referred to by the Deputy.  Details of the specific treatment should be sent to the Revenue Commissioners, Galway County District, Geata na Cathrach, Galway whereupon a determination of the eligibility of the claim will be made.

The Group have met and have decided to concentrate initially on a number of specific locations, including Ballinasloe.  Arising from the Group's decisions, the County Council has recently applied for funding for a study and works that the Council proposes to undertake in 2010 to alleviate flood risk to the town.  The applications are currently being considered, and a decision is expected to be made shortly in this regard.  Where further works to reduce flood risk are identified, including works to sluices, lock gates or bridges, these will also be considered by the Working Group.

The application was formally acknowledged by the Commission on 24 February 2010.  The EU Solidarity Fund does not fund full reconstruction nor does it fund prevention works.  It funds emergency operations to allow a rapid return to normal living conditions.A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund's threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster.  There are specific criteria which must be met to ensure a successful regional application to the EU Solidarity Fund.  These criteria include the majority of the population of the region being affected by the disaster and serious and long lasting effects on the region's economic stability and living conditions.  My Department continues to work with the Commission on finalising the costs underpinning the application.

Consumer prices are falling in Ireland while they are rising in many of our trading partners.  In January, for instance, harmonised consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in Ireland compared with an increase of 1.0 per cent in the euro area.  In addition, after adjusting for productivity developments, wages in Ireland are falling compared with increases in most other countries.  These developments confirm that the necessary adjustments in competitiveness are taking place, which will help position the economy to take advantage of the emerging global recovery.

The following table sets out the trend in tax receipts over the last five years and the 2010 forecast for tax revenue:200520062007200820092010 Budget forecastTotal Exchequer Tax Receipts €m39,25445,53947,24940,77733,04331,050Year-on-Year change10%16%4%-14%-19%-6%The above totals include receipts from Excise Duty — details of which are set out in the following table:200520062007200820092010 Budget forecastExcise Duty €m5,2335,5895,8385,4434,7034,514Year-on-Year change6%7%4%-7%-14%-4%

These include (but are not limited to) charges arising on products such as mineral oils, alcoholic beverages and manufactured tobacco.  In addition, Excise Duty includes receipts from the air travel tax, the carbon tax and from betting and licenses for retailing of liquor.  Receipts from Vehicles Registration Tax (VRT) are also a component of Excise Duty.The Revenue Commissioners have provided details of VRT receipts for the period 2005 to 2009 and these figures are also set out in the above table.  The figures provided are on a Revenue Net Receipts basis, which differ from Exchequer receipts due to timing and accounting issues.  The forecast for 2010 is also included.  VRT represented 22% of overall Excise Duty receipts in 2005 and this had fallen to 8% of total Excise Duties by 2009.  The decline in VRT receipts is due to both a reduction in activity and price as well as changes in the tax policy regarding vehicle emission levels.At end-February 2010, €4,736 million in total tax receipts were collected against a target of €4,800 million.  This included Excise Duty receipts of €566 million, against a target of €604 million.  VRT receipts to end-February amounted to €93 million.  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have provided the following data on motor tax receipts from 2005-2009 and their estimate for 2010.200520062007200820092010 forecastMotor Tax Receipts €m8008789571,0591,0571,025Year-on-Year7%10%9%11%-0.2%-3%

The spreads on Irish Government securities have narrowed in recent months on the back of the policies pursued by the Government in tackling the economic crisis.  NAMA is one of these policy initiatives.  I have been advised by NAMA that the transfer of the first tranche of loans will commence before the end of the month.  Once the loans transfer the banks will be placed on a sounder footing and will be better placed to support economic recovery.I have made it clear that I expect the banks which participate in NAMA to play their part in the economic recovery of the State by providing credit to viable businesses to protect and create jobs.  The NAMA Act further provides that I may issue guidelines regarding lending to the participating institutions to ensure that they play their part in the economic recovery of the country.  In this regard, I will shortly be issuing guidelines to ensure that SMEs, sole traders and farm enterprises will have recourse to an independent, external review of decisions of credit refusal by the NAMA participating banks.

The NAMA legislation provides for an annual statement to be produced by NAMA and for NAMA to submit quarterly reports, which I will make available to the Oireachtas.  The first of these quarterly reports is in respect of the quarter ended 31 March 2010 and is due to be submitted to me on or before 30 June 2010.The draft Business Plan, published by the interim NAMA in October 2009, sets out certain targets and projections for NAMA.  The publication of a business plan is a matter for the Board of NAMA which was appointed in December 2009.  I am aware that the Board proposes to review the Business Plan in the light of the extensive due diligence process currently under way and that any update to the Plan will be informed by information gleaned during that process and by the valuation of loans being transferred over the coming months.  I am advised by NAMA that the NAMA Board proposes to publish a revised Business Plan by the 30th June 2010.

To date the five participating institutions have advised NAMA that approximately €80 billion of loans are eligible for transfer to NAMA.  The consideration to be paid for these loans will depend on valuations, determined by the application of the valuation methodology approved recently by the EU Commission, of each of the eligible loans.  Moreover, section 84 of the NAMA Act provides that NAMA is not obliged to acquire any eligible asset on any grounds.I should point out that Section 50 of the NAMA legislation places a limit of €54 billion on the consideration to be paid for the loans regardless of the nominal amounts involved.  This limit can only be amended by a positive resolution by the Dáil.  I have no intention of adjusting this figure at this time.

The Financial Regulator also provides weekly liquidity reports.Weekly reports from the NTMA on the liabilities issued under the ELG Scheme.As part of the recapitalisations of AIB and Bank of Ireland last year, both banks agreed to implement a credit package to improve the flow of credit to the real economy.  Compliance with the commitments of the credit package is monitored by the Financial Regulator.

These studies make co-ordinated, integrated assessments of all the significant flood risk factors.  The results of the studies will be used to formulate long-term plans for addressing the key flood risks identified for each catchment area.  The CFRAM study for the Suir Catchment is currently underway and it is expected that the hydraulic modelling and draft predictive flood mapping will be completed this year with assessment of the various potential flood relief options becoming available early in 2011.The River Pill forms part of the Suir Catchment and an assessment of the implementation of a flood relief scheme for the Piltown area will be covered as part of this study.  Under a scheme introduced in 2009, the OPW wrote to all Local Authorities seeking prioritised applications for funding for localised minor flood mitigation works that the Authorities propose to undertake.  If Kilkenny County Council submits an application in relation to works that meet the economic and environmental eligibility criteria of this scheme, it will be considered along with any other applications received from the Council and other Local Authorities having regard to the overall funding available for such works.

The substances concerned include:synthetic cannabinoids (SPICE products)benzylpiperazine (BZP) derivativesmephedrone, methylone and related cathinonesGBL and 1,4 BDThe possession and sale of these substances will become illegal and subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Some of these substances are used in industrial activities and the application of controls under the Misuse of Drugs Act will involve a restriction on trade in their legitimate use.  The legal advice available to me is that, in accordance with EU law, it is necessary to notify the Commission of the proposed Regulations under the "Technical Standards" Directives 98/34/EC and 98/48/EC.  This imposes a 3 month stand-still period on the making of the regulations. Failure to notify would leave the Regulations open to challenge when they are made.

The difficulty relates to his request to be permitted to bring cannabis with him for his personal use.  The legal position in Ireland is that cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  All Schedule 1 drugs are considered to have no medicinal use and their manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession is unlawful except for the purposes of research.  The importation of cannabis and substances and products containing cannabis to Ireland, even if legally obtained in another EU Member State, is prohibited.  It is not possible for cannabis, products containing cannabis or derivatives thereof to be authorised in the State for medicinal use or for prescription by a medical practitioner.  The Misuse of Drugs legislation makes no provision for derogations in respect of the importation or possession of cannabis-containing substances or products.

Despite this high level of funding and fare increases over the years, the CIE companies are facing a very difficult financial outlook in 2009 due to declining passenger numbers in an increasing cost environment.  Decisions in relation to bus and rail services are a matter for CIE and its subsidiaries in conjunction, in the case of PSO services, with the National Transport Authority (NTA).  I understand that the companies in conjunction with the NTA are seeking to minimise the impact of their cost recovery measures on the quantity and quality of services and are seeking to maintain services at the highest level possible for all service users including those seeking employment and access to education and health services by, for example, focusing service changes on low patronage services.

I note however that while the Report draws on previous research material produced both within and outside Ireland, it does not take into account the rural transport measures in my Department's Smarter Travel Plan or in the Renewed Programme for Government, nor does it refer to the recent establishment of the National Transport Authority.

With regard to the Legal Aid Board, I can inform the Deputy that under section 7(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which the Legal Aid Board is or may be concerned.  Furthermore, in respect of any queries regarding the provision of legal services to any person, please note that the solicitor/client relationship is protected by privilege in accordance with the terms of Section 32 of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. The Legal Aid Board does not provide information to third parties regarding a person who may or may not be a client of the Board.It should be noted that the Legal Aid Board is required to consider and make decisions on all applications received in its Law Centres for legal aid.  When deciding to grant legal aid, the Board issues a Legal Aid Certificate to the applicant setting out the services to be rendered on that particular matter. In the event that the Board decides not to grant a Legal Aid Certificate, the applicant would be directly informed of the decision and the reasons supporting the decision. In addition, applicants would be advised as to their rights to have the decision reviewed and, if required, heard by the Appeals Committee of the Board. In that context, a decision arrived at by the Appeals Committee would be final.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is the statutory body charged with the independent oversight of policing in this jurisdiction.  I have been informed by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission that a complaint was received by them in relation to this matter in June 2007 and was deemed inadmissible.  I am afraid that it is not open to me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene with the Commission on any case.

The Act provides that the programme be managed by a member of an Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, who is assigned by the Commissioner to the role of Director of the Programme. A child may be considered for admission to the programme if s/he (a) accepts responsibility for his or her criminal or anti-social behaviour, having had an opportunity to consult his or her parents or guardian, (b) consents to be cautioned and, where appropriate, supervised  by a Garda juvenile liaison officer and (c) is between 10 -17 years of age. The Act does not provide a mechanism to appeal a decision to deem a child unsuitable for the programme.

The Attorney General advised that Mr Hartnett's report could not be published in full for legal reasons so an abridged summary was prepared and published in April 2008.  The abridged version contains all the findings and conclusions of the full report and is available in the Oireachtas Library.

In that regard the strategy sets out a number of actions related to training including the provision of training on international conventions relating to children in custody.  Amongst the courses delivered by the Crime Training Faculty in the Garda Síochána College at Templemore is a specialist child interviewer course.

The strategy sets out seventy actions and related performance indicators by which the effective implementation of the strategy can be measured.  One of the initiatives in this regard is an action in the strategy to establish youth fora to allow for direct dialogue with young people on policing issues, which has the potential to enable a qualitative assessment of the treatment of minors.

Those discussions are attended by representatives of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), the Director of the Centre, both Unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, along with a number of staff representatives from the Centre.The discussions have been focussed on proposals presented by the IYJS on all aspects of the closure, the arrangements to be made, and the transfer of staff and services to positions in Oberstown.  I am informed that the parties met again yesterday when it was agreed to refer certain matters to the Labour Court for determination and, in the meantime, to continue with further discussions on transitional rostering arrangements.  The Board of Management is being kept informed of progress and the National Director of the IYJS recently wrote to each individual staff member in the Centre to update them on developments.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1292	I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 to 219, inclusive, together.These questions relate to a publication issued recently by the Free Legal Advice Centre (FLAC) on the Government's direct provision system, the means by which the State discharges its obligations to provide accommodation and sustenance to asylum seekers while their applications are considered.  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers. The State, through RIA, assumes responsibility for providing suitable accommodation and certain other services on a full board basis. All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which has been assessed on the basis of normal social welfare allowance, reduced to take account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system.At end February, 2010, RIA's accommodation portfolio comprised 53 accommodation units across 21 counties accommodating 6,358 persons representing 94 different nationalities.  I do not propose to outline here the historical background to the setting up of the direct provision system in 1999, other than to reiterate that it is one of the central features of the Government's response to persons who choose to seek asylum here.  I am satisfied that the treatment of asylum seekers in this country is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer in this context anywhere in the EU, and that the direct provision system delivers a high standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer through coordinated service delivery to asylum seekers.One of the recommendations put forward by FLAC is that an audit of the direct provision and dispersal system should be carried out to ensure that the State meets the human rights obligations placed on it by domestic and international law.  I am satisfied that the system is in compliance with all such obligations. Nothing in the report would lead me to conclude that such an audit is warranted.Forty seven specific recommendations are made by FLAC.  Many of these recommendations are fundamentally contrary to long standing Government policy.  In relation to other recommendations, I should say that a review has recently been completed of the House Rules and Procedures for asylum seekers in direct provision, incorporating a complaints procedure, which govern the day to day operation of asylum accommodation centres and which clearly outline the obligations placed both upon residents and centre management.  This review involved, inter alia, RIA, representatives of centre managers, the Refugee Information Service and the Irish Refugee Council.  I believe that the Rules have to be given time to operate before considering any further changes.One of the criticisms made by FLAC is to the effect that families can have their living and education arrangements abruptly disturbed by transfers between centres.  Generally, this does not happen.  Transfers are never made for arbitrary or capricious reasons.  Indeed, where possible, residents in asylum centres are not transferred to other centres against their wishes but, on occasion, this simply has to happen. This may arise from, for example, the closing down of centres, medical emergencies or, as in certain cases, instances of personal conflict where there is a danger that keeping one or more of the involved parties in the centre could lead to serious trouble.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1314	Atlantic Corridor was founded in 1999 to facilitate, through its network of transatlantic and cross border activities and international linkages, the development of projects that will assist in supporting sustainable economic development and enhanced educational attainment.  Atlantic Corridor has successfully built and maintained relationships with key partners in the US, Canada and Northern Ireland. Its activities with these partners support the economic development of the midlands region through international linkages in business and education.Atlantic Corridor, through a range of projects, aims to support Irish companies to grow their exports and engage in technology transfer with international partners. It also focuses on promoting the teaching of science, technology and maths and stimulating an interest in these subjects in young students. Both these aims are in line with current Government policy which is focused on creating the smart economy.  Examples of worthwhile activities organised by Atlantic Corridor include:In 2008, Atlantic Corridor held an international conference on Science and Education. This has led to the development of a science education initiative for a rural school in Co. Offaly. The initiative will allow students in the school, through the use of high speed broadband and internet TV technology, to take part in cutting-edge science classes in the Georgia Institute of Technology, one of the top research universities in the USA. Georgia Institute of Technology, and their applied research arm, the Georgia Tech Research Institute have supported the project financially as well as through the provision of proprietary technology and expertise.In May of this year, the Mesa Biotech Academy will bring 5 teachers, 30 students and a number of Arizona State Government representatives to Ireland for two weeks to provide teacher training and classes for primary school students doing science. The Mesa Biotech Academy is an initiative based in Mesa, Arizona which aims to encourage participation in Biotechnology in school students through hands-on and high-tech learning. This visit follows their successful participation in the 2008 Atlantic Corridor Science and Education conference.Last year, Atlantic Corridor led a trade mission to Georgia and Arizona which resulted in new contracts and opportunities for 3 Irish companies. Furthermore, as a result of this visit, a reciprocal arrangement to provide short term office facilities has been agreed between Atlantic Corridor and the Enterprise Innovation Institute, Georgia Tech, Atlanta. This will allow Irish companies wishing to explore the US market to have desk-space at the Enterprise Innovation Institute in Georgia and avail of the services of this award-winning enterprise group and access to a fast-growing region in the USA.Following a 2008 trade and study visit to Toronto and Waterloo in Canada, a Midlands-based IT company has developed two technology transfer agreements with Canadian companies and the Athlone Institute of Technology has developed links for its Masters in Entrepreneurship with the Innovations Group in the University of Toronto.On an annual basis, Atlantic Corridor engages in a strategic planning exercise which involves a review of its activities against key metrics. These include, among others, the number of new International Business/Education Partnerships established, new exports facilitated (or part facilitated) through Atlantic Corridor initiatives, and technology transfer/licensing etc facilitated (or part facilitated) through Atlantic Corridor initiatives. This review informs its following year's work plan and is carried out with input from staff, board members and representatives from local business, industry and education.Atlantic Corridor provides reports and audited accounts to the Department of Foreign Affairs on a regular basis, in respect of the funding provided. The funding for the Atlantic Corridor project is kept under review.  I am not aware of any proposals at present to establish other similar projects around Ireland.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1315	The particular difficulties faced by Kurdish people in Syria, and throughout the region, is an issue of continuing concern to Ireland and its EU partners. This is one of a number of instances where minority populations are not being afforded the full rights and protections which should be due to all citizens.  We continue to avail, both bilaterally and at EU level, of all appropriate opportunities to engage with the Syrian authorities in relation to our concerns about the general human rights situation in Syria, including specific issues such as those concerning the Kurdish population. The Syrian authorities are well aware of the EU's concerns in relation to the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and the rights of minorities.Against this backdrop, I very much welcome the recent progress towards signature of the EU-Syria Association Agreement. I confirmed Ireland's strong support for the signing of the agreement when I met with the Syrian Ambassador to Ireland in October last. The text of the Association Agreement has been agreed at EU level, and provides a detailed framework for relations between the two sides. The EU is hopeful that the entry into force of the Association Agreement in the near future, following signature by both sides and the implementation of its provisions — including human rights clauses — will allow a more direct dialogue on human rights issues, including those pertaining to minority groups.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1316	The situation of the Coptic community in Egypt is closely monitored by my Department, as is generally the case in respect of religious minorities in the Middle East. The Government condemns acts of discrimination or persecution against persons on grounds of their religious beliefs.  There have been various instances and reports of apparently sectarian violence directed against members of the Coptic community, the most recent of which occurred on 6 January 2010, the Coptic Christmas Eve, in Naga Hammadi, a town in Upper Egypt approximately 600 km south of Cairo when six Coptic Christians were killed. It is reported that three men opened fire on a crowd standing outside a church, and then proceeded through the town shooting at passers-by. A Muslim man working as a security guard at the church was also killed, and a number of people were injured.I understand that three local Muslim men were arrested in the area on 8 January and subsequently charged with murder. The trial of the three accused began on 14 February, but, after a short hearing, proceedings were postponed until 20 March. The accused are being prosecuted in a Security Court under Egyptian emergency laws, and the prosecutor has stated that he is seeking the death penalty. Our Embassy in Cairo is continuing to follow the case closely. The Embassy is also involved in providing financial support to NGOs in Egypt working in the area of freedom of religion.The overall human rights situation in Egypt is kept closely under review within the EU and our concerns are raised under the structures of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement and the Egypt Action Plan agreed in 2007. The most recent meeting of the specific EU-Egypt sub-committee dealing with human rights takes place in Brussels this week (10-11 March) and is due to cover developments in relation to freedom of religion and belief in Egypt. EU Missions in Egypt also prepare an annual report assessing the overall human rights situation in Egypt.The human rights situation in Egypt has also recently been under review at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, within the context of Egypt's participation in the Universal Peer Review procedure. Ireland was one of a number of EU Member States which posed questions to the Egyptian government as part of this process, specifically raising the issues of press freedoms and freedom of expression, the use of torture, discrimination against women, and the position of NGOs in Egyptian society.  Human rights issues were among the issues which I discussed when I met recently with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, in Cairo on 24 February 2010.

Of the total current allocation, an amount of €1.612m will meet the day-to-day funding requirements of the NSCDA, including staffing cash, and the provision of an operational subsidy to the National Aquatic Centre of up to €1.03m.  The balance of the published current allocation was provided to NSCDA in the Revised Estimates to meet the costs of the settlement of a legal action taken.Most of the 2010 capital allocation (€3m) to NSCDA is intended to meet the costs associated with the refurbishment of the former Marine Institute building at Abbotstown as new office accommodation for the National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of sport in Ireland. Of the remainder, €600k is to meet the costs of a planned maintenance programme at the National Aquatic Centre, while the balance of the allocation (€42k) is to meet the final retention payment for the Irish Institute of Sport HQ and other minor associated works.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1318	I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 to 247, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department was established in 2002 against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes were delivered. It inherited a number of local and community programmes with diverse structures, which had been operated under the aegis of several different Departments. Clearly, there was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and the diffusion of resources.The cohesion process initiated by my Department a number of years ago to address these issues resulted in a significant reduction of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes. Until last year, there were almost 100 partnerships/local development companies and LEADER companies operating. The cohesion process has resulted in that number being reduced to a total of 53 entities providing full county-wide coverage across the country.Allocations to the local development companies under the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) — which replaced the Local Development Social Inclusion and Community Development Programmes from the beginning of 2010 — are made by Pobal, which manages it on behalf of my Department. Allocations are based on a number of factors, including the size/population of the catchment areas of the companies, the proposed annual programme of activity of each company, the deprivation index for the catchment areas and the available funding for the year. In addition, the indicative allocations for 2010 took account of concentrated levels of urban disadvantage in the catchment areas of urban partnership companies. The allocation for Co Mayo in 2009 was €1,136,953 and is set at €980,176 for 2010, a reduction of the order of 13.8%.I am aware that the delivery of front-line services and supports on a full-county basis is posing a challenge for some companies but I am strongly of the view that, in the context of reduced overall funding, priority must continue to be given to the most disadvantaged individuals and communities, be they living in rural or urban areas.I wish to remind the Deputy that my Department has no role in the internal operations of local development/partnership companies and therefore does not have a role in relation to staff employment and remuneration, which are matters for the boards of the companies as the employer. It is a matter for the boards to decide how best to operate with reduced budgets and to address any staffing issues, such as redundancy, which may arise. I would, however, anticipate that, within existing resources, individual companies will approach the issue of staff retention with a view to continued prioritisation of front-line services and will, consequently, examine all options for achieving necessary savings in administration and overheads.As I have previously indicated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected.

The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.Fuel allowance is payable for 32 weeks a year. The standard allowance is €20 a week while the rate in smokeless zones is €23.90 a week.   The scheme benefits almost 318,000 people a year at an estimated cost of €217 million in 2009.  Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated cost of €200m in 2009.  The electricity allowance covers standing charges plus VAT and up to 2,400 units of electricity in each billing period.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, administered by community welfare officers, can be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  Heating needs can also be met under the exceptional needs payments provisions of the scheme where a person is unable to meet such needs out of his/her resources. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.Since January 2010, community welfare officers have made a total of 3,840 payments at a cost of €908,000 under the exceptional needs payment scheme to assist people with increased gas, ESB and other fuel costs arising from the recent adverse weather conditions.  Assistance will continue to be provided towards the payment of heating bills for those in need.  The exceptional needs payments scheme is considered to be the appropriate response to heating needs arising from the recent cold weather.  Community welfare officers are best placed to deal with the situation having local knowledge and taking individual circumstances into account.

These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.Fuel allowance is now payable for 32 weeks and benefits over 318,000 people at an aggregate cost of €217m million in 2009.  The payment rate is now €20 per week or €23.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas.  Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of €200m in 2009.

Community welfare officers are best placed to deal with the situation having local knowledge and taking individual circumstances into account.  Improvements to the fuel allowance scheme, such as an increase in the rate of payment or an extension of the duration of the fuel season, would have considerable cost implications.  Paying fuel allowance for an extra four weeks in 2010 at current payment rates would cost an additional €28m, bringing total annual expenditure on the scheme to some €245m. Any changes to the scheme will be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.

In accordance with the Directive, Ireland has nominated certain raised bog sites, which contain priority natural habitats under the Directive, as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs).   In addition, Ireland has also designated other raised bogs as natural heritage areas (NHAs) under the 2000 Wildlife Act.By 1999, 32 raised bog site had been designated as Special Areas of Conservation. Commercial cutting was stopped and a 10-year grace period was granted to those cutting turf for their own domestic use.  This was intended to allow those involved sufficient time to find an alternative source of fuel. A similar 10-year period applies to bogs designated after 1999.  Approval was not sought from the EU in relation to this matter.  Arising from the ten-year grace period, cutting for domestic purposes may continue on the remaining 23 raised bog SACs until the end of 2011 and the 75 NHA raised bog sites until the end of 2013.  I am providing a list, with counties of location and extent of raised bog habitat within each site, of the 32 raised bog sites nominated for designation as SACs by 1999 and the 23 nominated in 2002. I am also providing information on the 75 which were classified as NHAs in 2004.Management plans for these sites will comprise measures to maintain them in, or restore them to, favourable conservation status as required by the Habitats Directive.  This will involve a complete cessation of all turf-cutting on the sites and restorative work including in relation to artificial drainage channels which were dug to facilitate turf extraction. Detailed management plans have yet to be drawn up for most sites, and these will be established after detailed surveys.  My Department has allocated some €5.4 million for measures to compensate turbary owners in 2010. This is intended to cater for existing arrangements, including the need to make provision for any commercial turf cutters who have established rights to compensation for mandatory cessation of their activities.The work of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Cessation of Turf Cutting in Designated Raised Bogs is nearing completion and I expect to receive its report very shortly. I will conclude my consideration of the report and any recommendations it contains, including in relation to cost and timeframe for implementation, as rapidly as possible, and will then be in touch with affected individuals and representative groups in regard to the position.No#YearSite CodeSite NameCountyHectares  of SAC% of Raised Bog HabitatHectares of Raised Bog Habitat%11997000006Killyconny

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1351	Approximately €5.4 million has been made available in 2010 for the Bog Purchase Scheme for domestic cutters and for the compensation of commercial turf cutters.  Having regard to available resources, priority in the domestic scheme is being given to those wishing to sell their interest in the 32 raised bog sites which were nominated for designation as Special Areas of Conservation in 1999. To date, over 220 applications have been received from owners of lands/rights within the 32 Raised Bog SACs.  The Bog Purchase Scheme is a voluntary scheme advertised by my Department. It is up to interested parties to apply to sell qualifying land under this scheme.  I have arranged for details of the voluntary bog purchase scheme to be forwarded to the Deputy for his information.

This approach is enabling the Government to deal proactively with the new circumstances in the residential property market, seeking to make economic necessity and social need work in tandem.I and my Department have met with representatives of NAMA to discuss how we might seek to ensure that a social dividend is secured through the long-term leasing of suitable residential units for social housing purposes, while providing a return in line with NAMA's mandate.  With NAMA now operational, I anticipate that this engagement will continue and intensify in the period ahead.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1359	The person named was allocated 36.39 Single Payment entitlements to the value of €158.29 each in 2005.  The EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that a farmer must use his/her entitlements at least once over a three consecutive year period by submitting an application under the Scheme and declaring an eligible hectare in respect of each entitlement held. If the entitlements are not used in this manner, the Regulations provide that they revert to the National Reserve.The person named did not declare any land on a Single Payment application form in the years 2007, 2008 or 2009. Therefore, in line with the governing provisions all his entitlements were surrendered to the National Reserve at the end of 2009. A letter of notification regarding the expired entitlements was issued to the person named on 25 January 2010. In that letter, the person named was informed of the right to appeal the decision to revert the entitlements to the Reserve.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1360	The use or disposal of animal by-products (ABP) is controlled under Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002. The Regulation, which came into effect in Ireland in 2003, classifies animal by-products into three risk categories, ranging from Category 1 (high risk) material to Category 3 (which poses little or no risk) and requires each category to be subject to an appropriate level of regulatory control.  Implementation of the Regulation in Ireland focused initially on the sectors where there was a higher risk to public or animal health. Wool is classified as a Category 3 ABP and generally seen as being at the lower end of the risk spectrum.Under the EU Regulation wool sheds require approval from my Department. Within the wool sector the initial focus was on the largest operators, who are engaged in the export trade, and at this stage 27 have been approved under the Regulation. Details of approved plants are available on my Department's website.  Smaller operators, who are not engaged in exporting, are only being contacted at this point in recognition of the reduced risk involved. They are being given until 1st May 2010 to submit applications and if they fail initially to meet the required standard will be allowed until 1st January 2011 to rectify any shortcomings. It is the intention that the Regulation will be implemented in a pragmatic and sympathetic manner; and it is certainly not intended to drive buyers out of the business.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1361	Live exports continue to be an important outlet for Irish cattle, providing an essential element of competition with the beef trade. Following the abolition of export refunds on live animals, other than for breeding, this trade is now almost exclusively with other EU Member States. Live cattle exports surged to over 286,000 head in 2009, almost double the level recorded in 2008.  In the period up to 21 February 2010 live exports are already over 200% ahead of the levels achieved during the same period in 2009. Within this, trade has been especially strong in cattle to the United Kingdom, calves to the Netherlands and weanlings to Italy and Spain. Over the full year it is anticipated that overall live exports should reach the highest level for many years.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1362	The person named applied for 24 animals in 2009 under the Suckler Welfare Scheme.   It is a condition of this Scheme that for herds of more than 10 cows the calves must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of five days. The applicant did not comply with this condition and, therefore, is not eligible for payment under the provisions of the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.
