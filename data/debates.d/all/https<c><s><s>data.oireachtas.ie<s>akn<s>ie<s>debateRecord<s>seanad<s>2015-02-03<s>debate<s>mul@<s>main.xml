          <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Senator Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter and I welcome the Minister of State. I am sorry the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is not present but I am conscious that he is meeting colleagues from Sligo County Council and its chief executive officer as I speak. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that it is important that central government does not take an attitude to smaller counties without the robust funding mechanisms of larger counties, which run a surplus, and mistreat them as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Since November last year, central government through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has prescribed cuts, which have affected the people of Sligo, in particular to library and tax office services and 50 additional lay offs. This is unacceptable. More than 180 people have lost their jobs with the council over the past three years. To treat them in this way is to do little more to the people of Sligo than what many of us believe Brussels and Frankfurt have done to the people of Ireland. Sligo County Council and other small local authorities cannot be treated like independent republics somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean dependent of the goodwill and charity of other countries. The citizens of County Sligo and Sligo town are the same as those in Fingal County Council, which happens to have the good luck to have Dublin Airport contributing to its commercial rates base. That local authority has €100 million on deposit while, at the same time, the lack of a robust funding mechanism for councils such as Sligo County Council has led to significant debt which I will break down.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> It is often reported in the media that the debt is in the region of €100 million. This includes €30 million spent on land acquisitions. The Department at the time insisted that the national spatial strategy be developed. Every party bought into the strategy, which was subject to public consultation throughout the country and which was overseen by the best spatial planners the Department could procure from Denmark. The strategy stated that Sligo should prepare for a population of 100,000 by 2020. However ridiculous or misguided that policy turned out to be, the Department told the council to think bigger, be more ambitious, prepare public private partnerships and not to be subservient to the developers of the future in the context of having sufficient land for social housing, community facilities and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Another €30 million of debt relates to mortgages, which have been lent to people. As is normal, there is collateral associated with them. A further €15 million relates to the contribution locally to the €120 million spent on upgrading water and waste treatment plants in Sligo. The remaining €25 million is the current deficit,which relates to servicing the debts and covering the cost of running the water services infrastructure, which increased from €5 million to €10 million per annum between 2008 and 2013. Sligo County Council is a small local authority dependent on central government support but Exchequer funding reduced during this period from €18 million to €9 million. It was, therefore, halved.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> In this scenario, we are being pushed out into the Atlantic Ocean and we are being told we can sing for the money because the Department is treating the local authority in isolation and blaming it for implementing Government and Department policy. I acknowledge there were issues relating to the collection of outstanding rates, arrears and so on but these have been addressed by the new chief executive officer and the council. Local authorities such as Sligo County Council, which do not have a Dublin Airport or hundreds of millions of euro on deposit, cannot be discriminated against for failing to have sufficient resources. Central government must come up with them. We expect that central government will provide additional resources for Sligo because the people of the county deserve no less.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">They are as entitled to their libraries, tax office and community services as anybody in Dublin South or Fingal, which have the larger rates bases. I appeal to the Minister and his Oireachtas colleagues from the area. There are three Senators from Government parties and two TDs. They will be held exclusively responsible for failure in this regard, as will the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, by me and my colleagues if this is not done.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_23">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist tábhachtach seo atá á freagairt agam ar son an Aire, an Teachta Ó Ceallaigh.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> As the Senator is aware, local authorities have three main sources of funding, namely, grants from central government, commercial rates and other locally raised charges. In recognition of the fact that certain local authorities have less opportunity to raise income locally, central government has provided much higher levels of funding to support the efforts of these authorities to provide an adequate level of public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> In 2014, approximately 54% of Sligo's budgeted income was expected to be provided by central government, almost double the national average of 28%. This clearly shows that the Government is committed to supporting the smaller authorities, a fact further underpinned by the Government's decision to redistribute 20% of local property tax allocated nationally from 2015 to support authorities that have lower valued property bases. </p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The issue of cash flow in local authorities is important and certain local authorities, with very large annual expenditure, generally as a result of population levels, can hold seemingly large levels of cash at particular times. All local authorities are required to ensure they can meet the public sector payment deadline by paying agreed invoices within 15 days. For a local authority with €98 million in creditors at the end of 2013, such as Fingal County Council, having cash on hand is prudent and appropriate financial practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> As the Senator will be aware, Sligo County Council has been incurring revenue deficits for the past number of years to the effect that the cumulative deficit now stands at over €24 million. Long-term debt is in excess of €120 million. </p>
            <p eId="para_28"> When this matter was raised in this House last November, Senator MacSharry suggested that Sligo County Council is in this situation in part because it has implemented Government policy, particularly in respect of water services and land purchases. The Minister wishes to be clear that the obligations placed on Sligo County Council in terms of implementing Government policy were no more onerous than in any other local authority in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> As the Senator knows, the implementation of the social housing strategy is a key priority for Government and will provide an opportunity for all authorities to develop lands they purchase for housing, thus providing additional housing and alleviating associated debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> In respect of water services, the Department's analysis shows that combined water and wastewater charges in Sligo increased by just 17% in the period 2008 to 2012 despite an increase in operating costs of 39%, suggesting that the water pricing methodology used was insufficient. The level of income collection in the water charges area was also unacceptably low at only 48% on average from 2008 to 2013. Both of these exacerbated Sligo County Council's financial and cash flow situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_31"> Other factors such as poor income collection and an inadequate bad debt provision policy have significantly contributed to the financial situation. The commercial rates collection level was just 59% in 2013. Collection levels for housing loans are also poor at 47%.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> It is a matter for individual local authorities, including Sligo County Council, to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner. The Department has not been prescriptive in respect of the steps Sligo County Council should take but is in regular consultation with the council in regard to its financial position.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The Minister set aside an allocation of €1 million in additional funding to 2014, and for 2015, for Sligo County Council to assist it to take the steps necessary to move to a more sustainable financial position. The payment of this funding remains fully conditional on a realistic and achievable financial plan which charts a path for long-term financial sustainability being agreed between the Department and the council. This process is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">The Minister, following a request from the council, is today meeting a delegation of elected members and senior officials regarding the council's historical and current financial position.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Senator Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T14:45:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_35">Why has the Minister been sent to the House to deliver such bad news? This is clearly an abdication of responsibility to the people. Are the people of Fingal more entitled to a library than the people of Ballymote? That is the question. It is no more onerous than for any local authority. Fingal has the airport in its area but the people of Sligo or in the Minister's native County Donegal will have to sing for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The attack on the people of Sligo has been relentless. It will come to bear specifically on the parties in the Government and it is wrong. It is apartheid by any definition to tell the people of Sligo that they are less entitled to a library or critical local services than the people of Fingal, and to dress it up in some way as independent recklessness. I have explained that the collection methodologies for commercial rates have been improved by the new executive and council. That is improving. However, to say, in a way, that central government and departmental policy had no part in driving an agenda which forced the council to buy additional lands and to spend in other areas is fundamentally wrong. It is an abdication of the Government's responsibility. Is it any wonder that the Germans walk all over us when we are prepared to do this to our own people in this country?</p>

            <p eId="para_43"> It is important to point out that with a complete sea change in the culture and the way of doing business, we must seek to do things differently. That is the reason the Minister and the Government are taking this issue very seriously, and right now the Deputies and Senators in the constituency are looking at potential solutions. If the Senator has not been invited to that meeting, I will convey that message. No doubt there will be an opportunity for the Senator to raise that in public.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> It is important to make the point that there is a problem here and we can be proactive in dealing with it. The proactive way of doing it is to meet with the Minister and the officials from Sligo County Council-----</p>

            <from>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T14:45:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_47">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. This matter relates to the current state of play with the entrenchment regarding the junior certificate and the fact that 350,000 children and 27,000 teachers have already had two days at home. It is a desperate situation. It is not just the students doing junior certificate this year who are suffering, but students in every year. The mock junior and leaving certificate examinations start in my local school next week and I understand another day of industrial action is threatened for March.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> Will the Minister outline the appeals process and safeguards for students under the new proposed teacher assessment model for junior certificate in the event of a grade dispute? Parents and students have a genuine fear that if a child's teacher for a subject does not like the child, the child could get a poor grade.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">What can be done to reassure parents and students in the event of a grade dispute?</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> I am conscious of the fact that this is a huge sea change for teachers culturally. All assessment for State exams has been done externally up until now, so this is a massive sea change. I recently spoke to a design and computer graphics, DCG, teacher about portfolio work accounting for 40% of that subject at leaving certificate level. With 50 students, it would take him 100 hours to correct those and to do them justice. There are genuine questions about where this time would come from. It would probably take about three working weeks at a minimum. Has the Minister considered a stipend towards that work? I believe it is such a good reform that it is worth introducing it and finding a middle ground on this, although many teachers disagree with me. Some parents are on the side of teachers while others would agree with what I am saying.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Will the Minister clarify a number of issues? Is it correct to say that the new model of assessment proposes 60% external assessment and 40% teacher assessment, with a State audit of 15% of the scripts assessed by the teachers? If correct, that represents considerable State oversight. It is just the tip of the iceberg for teacher assessment when compared with the 100% assessment carried out in other countries. I understand that there will also be a moderation process whereby teachers will be shown how to assess scripts so that objectivity is built in. Can the Minister verify that, please?</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> I understand that some parents, teachers and students are deeply concerned about the subjective element of the teacher-pupil relationship and how it might impact, positively or negatively, on the grade allocated by the teacher. I met a teacher with 15 to 20 years experience recently who told me that she sits in fear at parent-teacher meetings of parents challenging her about why their child did not get a higher grade or did not make it on to a team and so forth. That is a concern because teachers, as professionals, must be able to stand on their professionalism and point to assessment criteria - through which marking is done - that can stand up to scrutiny. In the event of a grade dispute, what appeals process will be in place?</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> I spoke to Pasi Sahlberg when he was in Ireland recently. In Finland there is 100% teacher assessment and the teachers there fought to have that. It is not unusual, however, as such a system also operates in many other countries. In the event of a grade dispute in Finland, a third party is brought in and if there is a difference of 2% between the initial grade and the second opinion, another opinion is sought. That type of assurance needs to be put out there but has not been spoken about here at all. I have read a good deal on this subject but have not heard anything about the concerns of people in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> There was a conference in Galway recently on reforming learning. I was struck by the views expressed by students, educators, health practitioners, parents, entrepreneurs and policy-makers present on the need to reform learning to help students to become more independent learners. One of the prongs of that would be the maturity that would emerge from teachers and students having a conversation about work and grades. Students could ask what the teachers are looking for and what they have to do to achieve the teachers' objectives. It would be nice to see that level of maturity come into second level education. I corrected scripts from 17 to 20 year old students at Mary Immaculate College. Those students were not much older than second level students-----</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Jan O'Sullivan)<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_57">I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this issue. She has a strong interest in this area and is strongly supportive of reform. In terms of an update, the talks are adjourned but are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> In November 2014 I announced compromise proposals for junior cycle reform, with 60% of the final exams in third year to be set and marked by the State Examination Commission and a State certificate to be issued to every student on completion of the junior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">A total of 40% of junior cycle marks will be awarded for project or portfolio work during second and third year. This 40% will be assessed by classroom teachers. The State Examinations Commission, SEC, will check 10% to 15% of these marks to ensure consistency and fairness. The current appeals process will remain in place for the final examinations, which represent 60% of the marks. Under this process, at junior certificate, appeal applications must be made by the school authority on the candidate's behalf, as the school authority must confirm to the SEC that the grade achieved is at variance with the grade expected. Under appeal, an appeal examiner, who was not involved in marking the work initially, will completely re-mark the candidate's work, question by question, in accordance with the original marking scheme. Quality assurance measures are in place at each stage of the appeal process to ensure the marking scheme is applied fairly to the work of each candidate. If a candidate is still dissatisfied after the appeals marking has concluded, he or she has recourse to a review by the Ombudsman for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> School-based assessment for certification will normally be worth 40%, and teachers will initially grade their students' work. There will then be internal moderation in schools between teachers of the same subject. The assessment and moderation toolkit of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, will provide clear guidance in this respect. Following internal moderation, there will also be external moderation of all schools for all subjects by the SEC. Every school will have moderation in all subjects. This will entail rigorous checking by the SEC of a portion of the marks to ensure consistency and fairness. The internal moderation and external processes will be clearly set out in the NCCA's assessment and moderation toolkit, and in the continuing professional development, CPD, programme of Junior Cycle for Teachers, JCT. The internal and external moderation, along with resources in the assessment and moderation toolkit, will provide checks and balances for transparency and fairness.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> For the school-based component, the appeals process has been and will continue to be part of discussions with the education partners, including teacher unions. The JCT will address this as part of its CPD programme. It is expected that the JCT will provide CPD on moderation, to include appeals on school-based assessment. It plans to begin with CPD on assessment, followed by a CPD programme on moderation, to include appeals. It is so important that teachers are able to attend their CPD as soon as possible. We have no plans to pay a stipend to teachers to carry out the assessment role. I am aware that the Senator also put forward a case for this.</p>

Will the Minister explain how this will happen? How much of this detail is understood by the teachers and the unions? I mean this respectfully.

            <p eId="para_65">It will be part of the 15%. We will ensure it goes into all schools in all subjects. This is to assure people that it will not be a system under which five papers will be checked in one school and none in another in a particular subject. It is to ensure people know there will be moderation and checking to ensure processes are fair. Continuous professional development is a very important part of this because it is about giving teachers the knowledge, resources and tools to ensure they are being fair to their students.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I welcome the Minister to the House. I have raised this issue with her previously. The last time we discussed it was a couple of months before the Christmas recess in the aftermath of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT's withdrawal from the process of developing a technological university for the south east via the planned merger with Carlow Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Waterford is the only major city across the island that does not have a university. The south east is the only region without a university. It is important for the people and economy of the region that this problem be solved once and for all. The Government gave a commitment to deliver on this issue, but the process is stalled and in trouble. The Department and the Minister do not understand the seriousness of the impasse following WIT's withdrawal. The institute seems stubborn in its analysis of the merger as not being realistic or workable. The Minister has appointed Mr. Michael Kelly to resolve the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> My question has three elements. I hope that Mr. Kelly considers all of the options, the first of which is to continue with the merger, the second of which is to consider a new configuration of the two institutes - new possibilities may have opened up in that regard - and the third is for WIT to go it alone. Is Mr. Kelly considering all of these options or is he simply sticking with the Government's plan, namely, the merger of Carlow IT and WIT? If this plan is not a runner for all of the players involved, what is plan B?</p>

            <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_73">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Before I discuss the technological university, I compliment the Minister and thank her for her ongoing engagement with the junior certificate issue. I am sure these are difficult times for everyone involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> I have serious concerns about the way in which the Waterford-Carlow technological university project is being handled, for example, the lack of consultation with staff in both institutions and the uncertainty about the vision and mission of a south-eastern university. Like Senator Cullinane, I have a difficulty with forcing a merger between the two institutes before they can seek registration as a technological university. It is my understanding that, whereas WIT has long been preparing to establish itself as a university and, for all intents and purposes, is ready to go now or will be within a short time, Carlow IT is playing catch-up. Taking the latter on board could set the project back as much as five years, which would not be a good idea.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> I have concerns about the financing required in such a merger. We have been told that the institutes must finance it from within their current budgets by seeking deeper efficiencies. The institutes of technology are struggling, having had their backs broken by serious budget cuts in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> In the event of a merger, what guarantees are there that there will not be a rationalisation that will impact negatively on the programmes on offer in both regions, but particularly Carlow? Programmes may move to Waterford, thereby disadvantaging people in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I have concerns but would like to see Senator Cullinane's third option of WIT going it alone, with Carlow to join later.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I thank the Senators for the opportunity to address this issue and I appreciate that Senator Cullinane has raised the matter before.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> As Members will be aware, we are rolling out a higher education reform programme that will significantly enhance the quality of higher education for the country and its regions. A high priority is the consolidation of the technological sector, helping to create new multi-campus technological universities of significant scale and strength where merging groups of institutes reach a high performance bar before attaining this new status. Three consortiums have formally entered that process. Two of them in Dublin and Munster are significantly advanced and submitted detailed plans for merger to the Higher Education Authority earlier this summer. The independent expert panel appointed by the HEA to assess the plans has given the green light to the two consortiums to proceed towards merger and application for technological university status.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> As Members will be aware, before Christmas Waterford IT announced it was suspending activities relating to a merger with IT Carlow, which could lead to the creation of a technological university in the south east. This Government is committed to the creation of a multi-campus technological university for the south east, as outlined in the programme for Government. The process and criteria to attain this new status were published in early 2012. One of the criteria was to merge, an aspect which was clearly understood at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> I announced before Christmas a new process to reinvigorate the technological university of the south east project. Senator Craughwell mentioned staff in his contribution and I can assure him that staff will be included in the consultation. I will check to ensure that has happened as intended. I appointed Mr. Michael Kelly to lead a process of consultation with the governing bodies, staff and students in Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology, as well as regional stakeholders, in order to develop a shared vision for a technological university in the south east and to serve the region. As former chairman of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. Kelly is well known within the sector. He has also played a leading role in chairing the consortium that has sought to establish a technological university in the Dublin region. Therefore, he has an in-depth knowledge of what is needed to create such an institution. He will be asked to report in the coming weeks on the outcome of the process in which he is currently engaged. We firmly believe that multi-campus technological universities will make a positive contribution to third level education in Ireland and to their regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> I reiterate that the concept of a merger is one of the criteria that was set out and agreed back in 2012. When I met the representatives of the two institutions, Carlow and Waterford, they gave me to understand that they accepted that a merger was one of the criteria. Subsequently, the Waterford institute withdrew.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> Mr. Kelly will report to me soon. I appreciate that the Senators have expressed to me concerns that have been brought to their attention. Both institutes know that merger is part of the criteria that were laid down from the very early stages. I hope that we will see progress in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_87"> I specifically wrote to the Minister, as an Oireachtas Member, seeking a meeting to discuss this issue. I got a reply to say that, due to earlier commitments, she was unable to meet me. I cannot understand her reply because this is such an important issue. She was able to come in here today to take this Commencement matter. Why is she not in a position to meet an Oireachtas Member who lives in the south east, who is passionate about this issue, who wants to move it on, who wants to be supportive, and who wants to talk to her about my real concerns and those of the people who have come to me with these issues? I ask her to reconsider a meeting. It is important that she listens to all the voices in the region and to work constructively with the Opposition on this issue. Without independent validation on where the collective is at, we will stumble from one crisis to the next and will leave this issue unresolved. I ask the Minister to take my comments on board.</p>

The HEA examines that and approves it. It has approved the two consortiums for movement to the next stage.

            <p eId="para_109">I welcome the Minister to the House. I raise this matter to seek a date for the commencement of the provision of fibre-optic broadband infrastructure in County Kerry, specifically in Dingle. Public representatives have been heard complaining all the time that the IDA is not inviting potential foreign direct investors to Kerry or having site meetings there to attract foreign direct investment. The reason, which I can understand, is that we do not have the broadband services necessary for them to invest in an area such as County Kerry. There is no question about that. Over recent years, perhaps two or three visits have been organised by the IDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> I was in Dingle recently and the case for broadband provision was made to me very passionately. Following the signing of the memorandum of understanding between Sacred Heart University in the United States, University College Cork, Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tralee on the setting up of a faculty of Sacred Heart University in Dingle, the latter has purchased the Christian Brothers school in the town and intends to develop it with a view to running semesters in marine biology or marine science. The authorities applied for broadband services. Private suppliers are wiping out all the urban areas, leaving the State to take up the slack and provide broadband to the remaining rural areas. In effect, it is similar to the approach to rural electrification 50 or 60 years ago. It is ironic that the Black Valley in County Kerry was the last place in Ireland to get electricity. I would hate to believe it would be the last to get broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> Let me return to my query on the provision of broadband to the university faculty that is to be run from Dingle.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">It was asked by a private provider for €36,000 up front and €16,000 per annum rental after that. The provision of broadband is one matter, but provision of affordable broadband is important as well. While contracts may be signed with private providers, the more subscribers who buy into it and take up broadband, the cheaper it will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> Following inquiries, I also understand that the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, cannot determine the retail price of broadband. It can only decide the wholesale price of the provision of broadband. That is what I stated on local radio recently in trying to enthuse consumers and get them going - the more consumers sign up for this service, the cheaper it will be for them. For this institution to be set up with broadband, however, it would cost €36,000 up front and €16,000 per annum rental. That is not affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> There is another aspect that must be highlighted in this regard. There was a technological company in the Corca Dhuibhne Gaeltacht that could not get broadband and moved to Baile Bhúirne. That technology company - a type of company that is badly needed in such rural areas - moved to Baile Bhúirne, another Gaeltacht area, to set up, extend and develop its business because we did not have broadband.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Alex White)<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T15:15:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_115">The Government's national broadband plan, NBP, will ensure that high-speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> We have created the conditions in which the commercial sector is now investing €2.5 billion. This accelerated pace of investment is hugely encouraging. It is delivering high-speed broadband to homes and businesses where low speeds would have been the norm only two years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> This investment is a huge vote of confidence in our recovering economy. However, despite this substantial progress, the Government is very much aware that large geographical areas of the country - rural areas with widely dispersed populations - will not get reliable high-speed broadband from the private sector. Therefore, the Government has made a commitment to ensure that every home, school and business will have access to high­speed services regardless of where it is located. The national broadband plan will see a State-led intervention provide that access in areas where the commercial sector will not.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> In November last, I initiated a public consultation on a national high-speed coverage map, which was produced in line with EU requirements. At the same time, an information pack was sent to every Senator and TD, together with an invitation to a presentation by my Department's NBP team, which took place in the AV room.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> The map, which provides detailed information on more than 50,000 townlands in every county, is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. It shows blue areas, where commercial operators will supply high-speed broadband, and amber areas, which will benefit from the State intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> The map shows that Dingle in County Kerry will have access to next-generation broadband through commercial investment. Given that the provision of high-speed broadband services to Dingle is to be delivered through private commercial investment, I am not in a position to comment on the precise timing of this programme. However, I understand from recent contacts with the company concerned that it hopes to deliver this during 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> I understand that this particular investment will also require significant improvement to the backhaul network between Dingle and Tralee. Given the diverse range of customers that this will benefit and the town's vibrant tourist sector, and all of the cultural pursuits and business requirements to which the Senator correctly referred, I am sure this investment will be very welcome to local residents and businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_123"> It is great that we will have broadband in the first half of 2015, I believe, in Dingle. The Government's roll-out plan for the other rural areas will take anything up to two years. Can anything be done to expedite that? The rest of the country outside of urban areas will wait an additional two years for the provision of broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">I genuinely commend the Minister, but this broadband must be affordable.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">I understand the Senator's views and agree with them very much. I also agree with his general points on what is often known as the digital divide. This is an equity issue as much as anything else; it is a matter relevant to business, education, families and the efficient administration of public services. In Dingle - as in other locations around the country - broadband is an important and valuable asset for cultural activity and pursuits linked to tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> I have notified Members of the House of the timelines and I will keep them updated. By the middle of this year we will have the full intervention strategy for the State scheme. We will apply for state aid approval in the European Union in the summer and I hope it will go to tender by December 2015 in order to get a bidder or bidders in place so contractor contracts can be offered next year. They will then have to build the infrastructure, which is equivalent to 100,000 km of road. We know how long it takes for roads and other big infrastructure projects to be completed. I am anxious that this be expedited and done as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I want to indicate to the Leader at the outset that we agree with the taking of the earlier signature motion to facilitate the banking inquiry. My colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, took that Bill last week and while we still believe an independent, Leveson-type inquiry would have been a better way forward, we want to ensure that the inquiry can get on with the work it needs to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> There have been many discussions in recent weeks on the potential sale of Aer Lingus. I am pleased to hear the soundings from Government that it appears at this stage that it will reject the IAG offer. I believe it should be clearly rejected. My colleague, Senator Barrett, informed me of the goings on at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications this morning. People from all parties and none are concerned about the future of our airline, and I welcome the fact that some Government Senators and other Members have been more trenchant in their views than others. They have stood up and said they do not want the strategic interests of the country diminished in any way by the sale of Aer Lingus. However, it is important that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, provides certainty as soon as possible and confirms that we will not be selling our stake to British Airways.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> The irony is that this is happening when many of the thousands of deferred members and pensioners who had their pensions cut in Aer Lingus and in the airport superannuation scheme will have received their first pay cheque showing that the retired members have lost six weeks' pay while others have got confirmation now that they are losing 50% or 60% of their salary. Is the Leader aware that the deferred members and the retired members have been issued with a waiver to sign? It states that if they accept the terms of the reduction and the restructuring of their pension, they are waiving all future rights to take any legal action against the company or the trustees of the scheme. That is a further kick in the teeth in that they must decide whether they will accept that and if they do accept it, they are waiving all future rights. That is wrong. What is the Government's view on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> On more than 20 separate occasions since last year I raised the issue with two Ministers for Health of the multiple sclerosis drug fampridine or Fampyra. I spoke to another gentleman last week who now is no longer working and who cannot get out of bed because his mobility is so bad, but the drugs programmes and policy unit, DPU, and the Department of Health have rejected the revised submission from the drug company, Biogen. We are talking about a cost of €270 per month, and there are approximately 1,500 MS sufferers. I do not know what else to do with this because we debated it for half an hour with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who basically said it was nothing to do with him. It is to do with him because the Government is responsible for the health of the citizens of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> It is about a year since I first flagged this issue. There are hundreds of sufferers who cannot get the drug that is helping them improve their lives. Will the Leader raise this issue through his good offices and perhaps through the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party? I ask my Labour Party colleagues to raise it in their parliamentary party meeting. What is happening is wrong. Next week I will be inviting Members here to a briefing by some of the senior neurological consultants to speak on this specific drug and why it should be made available again to MS sufferers in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I refer to the discussions about the potential sale of Aer Lingus. Of course, matters are at a very early stage and there is no offer, but I have already put on the record my opposition to the sale of the Government's 25% stake in Aer Lingus. Indeed, I opposed the sale of the rest of what was the Government's much larger stake in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> I welcome the good news today of the Accenture jobs announcement. Those jobs are a welcome mix of positions for experienced individuals and positions for people straight out of college. It was welcome to see such a big announcement. Many Members last week asked the Leader to arrange a debate on jobs and job creation in light of other good news announcements about jobs, and I understand he will facilitate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I also welcome that there are 100 new recruits to the Garda. There are some good photographs of them in the newspapers today. They have completed their first day of training in Templemore. It is very welcome to see the Garda open to recruitment again. It is another piece of good news.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> There is a debate on overseas development scheduled for tomorrow, but I hope there will be time during that debate or at a future date to debate issues around human rights compliance and overseas development. I note, in particular, the issues regarding human rights protections in Egypt. I am sure all of my colleagues will join me in welcoming the release from prison in Egypt of the al-Jazeera journalist Peter Greste, but will note with concern that two of his journalist colleagues are still in detention in Egypt. Members will join with me in calling for their release.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> There is another very pressing human rights issue for women in Egypt and in a number of other countries. We have debated it previously in the House and, indeed, have led the way on criminalising female genital mutilation, FGM. Last week in Egypt there was the first ever conviction for performing an act of FGM. It was on foot of legislation passed in Egypt seven years ago. It was the first conviction despite the fact that an estimated 91% of women and girls in Egypt have been subjected to FGM. I am glad Ireland has legislation in that regard, but we should note with concern the fact that FGM remains a prevalent abuse of women's rights worldwide.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">It is good to hear all the good news. Unfortunately, there is some bad news. More than 1,000 children became homeless in Dublin last year, according to Focus Ireland. This indicates that the housing crisis has escalated to a homelessness crisis and a child welfare emergency. A total of 90% of these families had never experienced homelessness previously. These are families that have been priced out of the monopolistic market which operates on the landlords' terms and not in market equilibrium. The rental market must be regulated and I call on the Government and many others to move on this sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The current rent supplement allowance is not adequate to protect families from losing their homes or becoming homeless. Many people who avail of it cannot access properties on the private rental market for two documented reasons. First, the vast majority of properties that are rented on the market are significantly above the threshold for rent supplement, as we have often heard. Second, some landlords are refusing to accept rent supplement payments. This is blatant discrimination against those in receipt of rent allowance and is simply unacceptable. Our existing equality legislation includes several grounds for protection against discrimination, such as gender and family status, but it does not provide protection from discrimination based on poverty or socioeconomic status. In light of the ongoing and unconcealed discrimination against people who are in receipt of social welfare payments in the private rental market, I ask the Leader to invite both the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House to debate this matter jointly.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Furthermore, the escalating crisis and its devastating impact on families and children provides yet another reason for guaranteeing economic, social and cultural rights in our Constitution. On 23 February last, the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of amending the Constitution to strengthen these rights, subject to the maximum available resources. Unfortunately, however, the Government has not committed to a referendum based on the convention's recommendations. I am perplexed by that decision. By offering a referendum to the people that would strengthen the enforceability of economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland, the Government could give people a chance to guarantee everybody in Ireland a life of dignity, including access to an adequate standard of living, which includes adequate housing. Will the Leader organise a debate with the Taoiseach or the appropriate Minister on why the question of economic, social and cultural rights is not being put to the people?</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I welcome the record level of applications to the Central Applications Office for third level courses which are to begin this autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I wish all the applicants every good fortune. This will be an exciting period in their lives. We are certainly excitedly looking forward to seeing them all when they enter as freshmen in the autumn. Think of that optimism and beware the prophets of gloom who seem to surround this, describing it as an ordeal. This is an exciting period in any young person's life and we look forward to seeing them. </p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I also welcome the moves by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, to reduce the cost of drugs in this country. Those costs are excessive, particularly by comparison with Spain. In wishing the Minister every success in his endeavours, I also commend Ms Susan Mitchell and Mr. Pat Kenny, the journalist and broadcaster, who have made this an issue for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> On the issue of the British Airways takeover of Aer Lingus, I attended a meeting organised by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, Deputy John O'Mahony, this morning. It emerged at that meeting that the British regions are completely neglected by British Airways. There is one route only - into Heathrow. All of the other routes have had to be developed by other airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair. That also applies in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. There is only one route in each case - George Best Belfast City Airport to Heathrow and Dublin Airport to Heathrow. At Derry Airport, Belfast International Airport, Knock airport and the airports at Cork, Kerry, Shannon and at Dublin for most of the day, one will not see British Airways flights. How British Airways has come to be seen as the saviour of Irish aviation when it has shown so little interest in the market heretofore is quite remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The committee received a note from the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who did not give evidence at the meeting. The note states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_146">The Irish Takeover Panel has ruled that Aer Lingus is now in an offer period and under Irish market abuse law, the relevant officials are deemed to have access to inside information on this issue and are obliged to ensure that such information remains confidential. In these circumstances, it is not considered appropriate for officials to attend the committee at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The application of jurisdiction of the Irish Stock Exchange to this Parliament is unacceptable in my view.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">This is a major policy issue. The Irish Takeover Panel which advised the Department has two nominees from the Central Bank. I support the Leader today with regard to the Governor of the Central Bank, who wants to be in this House more. We are speeding up the legislation to allow him to appear. Also on the board of the Irish Takeover Panel are nominees from the Irish Banking Federation, the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Irish Association of Investment Managers and the Law Society. This issue is bigger than any of those bodies and Parliament should not have to kowtow to the Irish Takeover Panel. We should debate this issue fully because the other side - those who are pro-takeover - have no such compunction. They are leaking information to the media on a daily basis while Parliament is not allowed to discuss the issue fully. I am afraid that I have to say to our friends on the Irish Takeover Panel and the Stock Exchange, "Back off; this is a parliamentary democracy".</p>

          <p eId="para_150">There is grave concern in my part of the world at the shooting down of Heather in the Waterville area prior to the weekend. This female hen harrier, as we know, was tagged with a satellite tracking device shortly after she hatched in 2013 in east Kerry. She quickly became a star as her travels were followed by thousands of people on an online blog. The hen harrier project has been run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a local community group, IRD Duhallow. As we know, the hen harrier is a protected species under the Wildlife Act. Thousands of people have followed the bird's progress from Kerry to the Wicklow mountains through a satellite tracking device.</p>

          <from>Senator Denis O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_157">Senator Coghlan made a very powerful case about the loss of the hen harrier. Not to be flippant, but I agree with him on our nomadic breeds of Kerry birds and Kerry people, as during Seanad election campaigns he can be found in very quare places and is well able to make his way around.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I wish to raise the issue of problems with medical cards and the fact there is no cross-checking between the Department of Social Protection and the HSE. It is ridiculous in this day and age that subsistence farmers in long-term receipt of farm assist are compelled when seeking a medical card to get a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners. It is obvious to anyone that a farmer or any person in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment has gone through the hoops and has been checked every second year to ensure he or she meets the criteria to receive farm assist, but these recipients are compelled to go a step further and get a tax clearance certificate from Revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> I am aware of a farmer who has serious health issues. He is in his early 60s and has severe arthritis, blood pressure and other problems. He has not taken his medication for the past 18 months because he went to a tax adviser accountant who told him if he paid €500, the accountant would prove he did not owe anything to Revenue. This is ridiculous. Why does the HSE not look at the bona fides of this man's application and state that as he has been in receipt of farm assist for the past eight or ten years, it will accept he is a very poor surviving farmer with a family and forget this extra requirement?</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I have written to the Minister about this issue. It is an absolute disgrace. This is one of several instances I can describe. It is an attempt by the Department of Health through the HSE to deprive people in so far as possible of medical cards. I was under the assumption listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that young children with special needs were automatically entitled to medical cards. Alas most of them do not receive one, which is ridiculous. I ask the Leader to check both of these issues. If what I come across in my area is prevalent throughout the country, it is an absolute disgrace the Department of Social Protection does not look over its shoulder to check with the Department of Health on these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I agree totally with Senator O'Donovan. There is far too much red tape involved in the acquisition of medical cards, particularly in very straightforward cases such as that described by Senator O'Donovan.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> We need a broad debate on the future of the ambulance service. We need to know the plan for the ambulance service in rural Ireland. Following the closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon things have got much worse. We were promised we would have an advanced paramedic at almost every crossroads to prove to us a better service would be in place than the accident and emergency department. In rural Ireland the average waiting time for an ambulance is between 40 and 50 minutes. Unfortunately at the weekend we had a tragic situation where a 19-year-old waited 40 minutes for an ambulance and when it arrived it appeared the poor young fellow had passed away. The ambulance arrived with no paramedic on board, giving him no chance of survival.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> We then had the disgraceful scenario whereby someone from WestDoc could not come until an hour and a half later to pronounce the poor young man deceased. I do not blame the ambulance staff or the paramedics. The simple reality is we do not have enough of them. There is a very simple way to improve the situation. We need to train our first responder firemen to emergency medical technician, EMT, level. Every fire station has nine or ten personnel and three or four of them could be trained. We would then have first responders with EMT training who could be at a call in a matter of minutes. If we get cross-party support for this we can convince the Minister of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Health to see the logic in it. I call for a serious debate on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">I agree with Senator O'Donovan that this country is smothering in bureaucracy, for example, the HSE looking for tax clearance certificates from small farmers and so on, but what about us? I am nearly 30 years in this House. For the majority of that time, we did not have to fob in, produce receipts for this, that and the other or keep them for six years and employ public accountants, whatever those are. We are being treated like schoolchildren. I was elected in a constituency of 65,000 voters. They trusted me. I do not give a damn whether the rest of the people trust me. I hope they do and have every reason to. Before my illness, I was in this building every single day of the week. I campaigned to have it opened on Saturdays, so it closed down on Saturdays because I was just about the only person who used it. I find it grossly insulting that we have to fob in. The people are the deciding element in this. They will know when Members are not representing them, are not working or are passengers, and they will get rid of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I will raise a further matter. I have received a communication from Fr. Shay Cullen, who is well known to many Senators and has worked in the Philippines for many years and has been an heroic Christian. He sent an e-mail that I am sure other Senators also received concerning the recent visit of the Pope. The Pope is a remarkable man who wanted to meet the poorest of the poor, the street children and so on, but the authorities in the Philippines took them all off in a bus for a seven-day holiday to get them out of the way. The Pope never actually saw them. Fr. Cullen made the point that street children in the Philippines are routinely jailed, where they are subject to sexual assault by older boys, jailers and so on. There are examples of eight year old children being forced to perform sex acts on older boys. The Philippines Government stated that Fr. Cullen was seeking publicity just to get donations, which was a scandalous claim to make about someone who has spent 30 or 40 years working there. I wish to put on record the fact that the Pope was denied the opportunity to meet these people. We should keep an eye on the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">Even with 25.1% we do not control Aer Lingus, but our chances of retaining that connection will be considerably reduced if the 25.1% is sold. Following the sale of Irish Sugar to Greencore, the country lost its sugar quota and an entire industry disappeared. I hope that the same will not happen in terms of Aer Lingus.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> I wish to raise a further matter of concern to me, namely, the provision of funding for local authorities where children with intellectual or physical disabilities are living in local authority housing. In Cork, 47 families are waiting for houses to be adapted to accommodate their children. Some have been waiting since 2008. No funding has been provided to the local authority. A further 30 families need changes to be made to their houses if their children are to continue living at home. When parents work 24/7 to look after their children, it is wrong that they do not get the support and accommodation they need and is otherwise only available in full-time care centres. The parents are providing the care, so we should be able to fund facilities for them in their own homes. We should debate this matter. The issue should be given priority, particularly in light of how little funding has been provided in the past six years. I request an early debate on the matter with the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Respectfully, I remind the Leader of a few debates that we have requested here in the House over recent weeks. I know he does his utmost to get the relevant Minister to attend. I ask him to reconsider the following matters and put them on the schedule at the earliest juncture. The first matter is what I believe is the abuse of our bail laws and the ongoing issue of reoffending and serious criminality by people out on bail. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. We held a referendum on the matter but its outcome has not been adhered to. The second matter is the future of library services across the country. The third, as other colleagues have mentioned, is the exorbitant cost to the HSE and the taxpayer of medicines and drugs, which in some instances are prohibiting seriously ill people from receiving the medicines they require. Those issues could do with an airing and a robust debate here in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> As a primary issue, I support Senator Sean Barrett in his ongoing concerns regarding what is really an attempt to impose a gagging order or have a chilling effect on public discourse and parliamentary debate with regard to the proposed sale of Aer Lingus to British Airways. It is wrong for officials of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to decline to attend a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. The officials have a lot to offer in the debate. We are not asking them to disclose anything confidential. We are not asking them to show their hand. We are not asking them to show any bias or preference in the matter. We merely want them to make available to the elected members of the committee the factual position, the legalities and the various technical details of the proposed sale.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> This House spoke with one voice on at least two occasions last week. We are unanimously opposed the prospect of selling off Aer Lingus. The fact that British Airways has told us it is now willing to afford the chambers of commerce of Cork, Shannon and Dublin a veto on the Heathrow slots-----</p>

          <p eId="para_214"> Still on defence matters, I read with interest, as I do every Sunday, Eoghan Harris's excellent article. He proposed that the 1916 celebrations should be primarily based on the Defence Forces. I do not necessarily agree with that proposal, I am not a militarist. However, I was shocked when he stated that were we to adopt that policy we would not have enough soldiers to maintain a presence on the particular day at the various locations - the GPO, Ashtown, Wexford and wherever else people mustered on that famous day. I am concerned about that. We are very proud of our Army, both commissioned officers and enlisted men. It is time the Minister for Defence came to the House to explain the reason our Army has been reduced so much. I know the Provisional IRA has gone out of action, hopefully for good, but there are other elements that are not, the Continuity IRA, Real IRA and other IRAs. One only realises the value of the Defence Forces when one needs them. I want the Minister for Defence to give an audit on our Army numbers and also an audit of Army property around the country.</p>

Investment in our road infrastructure is critical for future economic growth and securing job creation projects in the regions. This investment allows a number of key projects to go ahead, a case in point being increasing the vehicle head room at the Lough Atalia railway bridge in Galway city which is an important access for Galway city and Galway Port. Out of the €294 million, a total of €23.5 million is being spent in Galway city and county. The investment also includes the rehabilitation schemes for 175 bridges throughout the country and 211 low cost safety projects as well as significant investment in footpaths in the interests of public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I welcome the reopening of the Garda College at Templemore and the fact that 100 new entrants have commenced their training there. I welcome a comment made by the Taoiseach who said he hopes the college never closes again.</p>

She said officers need the courage to stand up against bad conduct in the force and the courage to cry "Stop" when old practices which have served the force so badly are continued. We must never again have situations such as the penalty points scandal or others highlighted by whistleblowers, which have occupied so much air time in recent times. I also welcome the plans for the new DNA database-----</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I thank the Leader for the swift action he took before Christmas in respect of a debate on homelessness in this House. I promised at that time that I would keep an eye on the homelessness situation, particularly here in Dublin. Today, I received an e-mail from a representative of the Peter McVerry Trust to tell me that the 271 beds supplied by the Minister were not all used initially, but that they are all being used now. Every night of the week, people are being turned away from hostels around the city due to insufficient capacity. We now have an increase in the number of people homeless and on the streets sleeping rough, even though the beds provided by the Minister are all in use and still in place. I thank the Minister for these beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> We have a serious issue with respect to homelessness, leaving aside those sleeping rough. I ask the Leader to look into this for me. However, quite aside from this, over 40,000 houses were sold on the buy-to-let scheme during the Celtic tiger era. Those houses are now in distressed mortgage situations. Banks, as they are repossessing these houses, are evicting the tenants because they have no commitment to them. Today, Fr. McVerry told me of a single mother with a three-year-old child who last night arrived at his place looking for accommodation. She was going to sleep rough with the child last night. This woman will return tonight. She has been told - by the HSE I believe but I may be wrong and I do not want to say necessarily that it was the HSE - that tonight, in order to receive accommodation, she must report to a Garda station by 8 p.m. so they can call a social worker and for her and the child to be taken into care. This is urgent, so I ask the Leader to look into this straight away and see that this person is provided with accommodation. </p>

          <p eId="para_229">I wish to raise an issue regarding Bus Éireann. It has come to my attention that Bus Éireann intends to discontinue the Dublin service to Carrick-on-Suir which operates six times per day. Despite my best endeavours to contact Bus Éireann, by e-mail and by phone, I have got no response from it. However, I am reliably informed by SIPTU, one of the unions representing the workers, that it is proposed to remove this service in the first week of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> Members will be aware that Bus Éireann is subsidised and has a public service obligation. It gets millions of euro per annum from the Government to provide exactly what is being provided to Carrick-on-Suir and other such towns, namely, a public service. This service brings people from the town not alone to Dublin but also to all of the places along the way, including Kilkenny and Carlow. It allows people who do not have their own transport to visit loved ones in hospitals, carry out business in Dublin and attend social events. It is unacceptable that Bus Éireann is doing this without any proper negotiation or any proper information being provided to public representatives in the area. There will also be, as I understand it, job losses as a result of this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">As Members read in the media and are informed that the number of people using transport has increased and is increasing on a daily basis, it is something of a mystery as to why this is happening. I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to intervene on this issue. I also ask the Leader for his support. I understand there are also difficulties in the Leader's own city in respect of Bus Éireann and the changing of routes. Perhaps he and I could combine on this issue and sort out the problem together.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I seek a debate in early course with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on public sector pay and specifically regarding pay for gardaí. I note the Labour Party leader in the House has mentioned the new recruits in Templemore and all Members of course welcome that. However, I wish to quote briefly from an e-mail I received from one of them. It states that each of the 300 new recruits is proud to be doing what most of them always have wanted to do. It notes they battled through a tough recruitment process, which started off with 25,000 people, but goes on to state they deserve better than the pay scale that is being recommended at present. An Garda Síochána stresses the slogan "a fair day's pay for a fair day's work". However, following on from a 10% decrease in 2009 and a further 10% later for new entrants, the rent allowance of €4,000 per year pensionable is also to go. Were the rent allowance to be included, the pay would be approximately €27,000, which is hardly a high salary.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> It is incredible in the extreme to hear the Labour Party congratulating new recruits who are to come in on a salary of €23,171. That is a full 36% below the average industrial wage. This is unthinkable and while Senator Mullins rightly quoted that officers must have the courage to stand up to their colleagues, I hope they are not in particular need of money. At 36% less than the average industrial wage, how dare we tell new recruits - who arguably are the brightest generation of recruits with university degrees and second level education many before them would not have had - that they can operate at €23,171, while, incidentally, they will be expected to be above reproach, better than their predecessors and to have the courage of which Senator Mullins and the Government spoke? Far be it from the industrial relations champions about whom Senator Landy talks in the context of Bus Éireann, but gardaí are expected to operate - Senator Bacik may leave the Chamber - as new recruits for 36% less than the average industrial wage. These are the people we expect to do a good job on our behalf.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">I wish to raise an issue related to one raised earlier by Senator Zappone. I believe renting must become a viable alternative to home ownership and tenants should not be treated as second-class citizens in the housing market. The recent attention on the Central Bank's mortgage regulations obscures the fact that for many young people, home ownership is a long way off and their reality, for the foreseeable future, is renting. Moreover, for some people renting is also a choice and this must be recognised and supported. Members have a responsibility to make renting a viable alternative to ownership, as it is in most comparable cities across the world, and not merely a stop-gap measure to bridge the gap between leaving the family home and buying a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Tenants need more security, including making long-term tenancy attractive for landlords. They need rent certainty and the possibility of increases linked to a specific index or capped at a certain percentage of the original rent agreement over a number of years. Landlords also need incentives to make this happen. Most importantly, being a landlord should be treated and supported as a legitimate business or career and this can only be to the benefit of tenants. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has indicated that the Government is considering ways to increase tenants' rights through incentives for landlords. I believe this is the correct approach but it must take into account that renting can be a long-term choice and an alternative to home ownership. Solutions must take into account this fact and not be merely a short-term solution to the current shortage of housing supply. Therefore, I call for a debate together with Senator Zappone, albeit perhaps a wider debate than that for which she had called, in respect of renting in general in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">-----and as a result, what is happening in Carrick-on-Suir has happened in several places in my own part of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I would like to expand slightly on, and ask the Leader a question about, the remarks of my colleague, Senator O'Sullivan, about the Russian overflight. We face an increasingly serious and potentially dangerous stand-off between Russia, the EU and now the United States with hawkish elements in the Obama Administration in recent days calling for the arming of the Ukrainian army or for the supply of arms to the Ukrainian army on the basis that it is using outdated weaponry, in particular anti-tank weaponry dating back to the Soviet-era. Following on these reports, several European Union leaders, including the German Chancellor, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, whose country refuses to supply arms to Ukraine, and others have said there must be a diplomatic solution to this stand-off. I would like to know exactly where Ireland stands in this regard. I know we are adopting a multilateral approach when it comes to foreign affairs matters but this situation is getting out of control and the militarists in NATO, in the Obama Administration and perhaps in other parts of Europe are beginning to flex their muscles, which could have a potential downside for the future peace and security of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I would like to know precisely what the Irish position is in regard to the continuing sanctions regime, in particular in light of the newly-elected Greek Prime Minister withholding Greek support until the last minute for an extension of the sanctions regime for a further six months. The Greeks obviously raised issues and asked questions. As a small neutral country on the periphery of Europe and in a situation where a common foreign policy position has not been taken on this, I would like to express my serious concerns about Ireland adopting a position which other larger countries with a militarist tradition might wish to pursue. It is a very serious issue for the Irish people and the continuation of sanctions and of the stand-off, without any form of diplomacy being seen to be engaged in - at least on the surface - between President Putin and the European Union, is not in our best interest nationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I join with my colleague, Senator Michael Mullins, in welcoming the allocation of almost €300 million for the maintenance and upkeep of our roads infrastructure, in particular the allocation of €1.5 million for the rehabilitation of the bridge in Lough Atalia, which is in the heart of Galway city. This is critical funding for the future development of Galway Harbour and the surrounding area. The bridge was not built to deal with the modern traffic issues we face today. At the recent oral hearings for the proposed development of the harbour, the issue of traffic came up and was discussed in great detail. Therefore, this allocation of €1.5 million is to be greatly welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I also wish to refer to reported comments of the sponsors of the working abroad expos. These expos were held in the RDS each year. They were hiring fairs, targeting our most skilled, young and highly educated workforce who had to find jobs abroad during the recession. This is the first year there is an expo in Perth where Irish companies are now targeting our young highly skilled workforce who had to emigrate. The Irish global recruitment firm, CPL, has indicated that it has 2,500 full-time positions waiting for our young Irish abroad. This is a great sign of the economic recovery and I commend the Government on the work it has done over the past few years.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">Again, I raise the issue of the very serious motion before this House last week, which Senator Cullinane rightly raised. It was thrown in at the last minute to be taken without debate. I would like the Leader to clarify - I suppose he has already given an answer - whether the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was in touch with him. In light of the precedent set in the Dáil - this is no reflection on the Cathaoirleach and I am not casting aspersions on him - I would like to know if he was in receipt of correspondence or communications from the former Minister, Deputy Shatter. We have to know why the motion for this commission of investigation was, unusually, to be taken without debate. The motion on the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes was taken with debate the day before.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">It is extremely important. It is on the tip of everyone's tongue today in the country. I believe the Cathaoirleach would agree that the idea that we cannot discuss it on the Order of Business is not a runner. We need to know if the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was in touch with the Seanad office on this issue and, if so, what was the reply. I assume that if the Cathaoirleach received a letter, he dealt with it in the same way as the Ceann Comhairle - he had no role in it - but we need to know the pressures that he was put under, if any. We also need to know the pressures the Leader was put under not only by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, but also-----</p>

          <p eId="para_259">It is extremely relevant to democracy and debate in this country. A change was introduced in this House, facilitated by the Leader, to the effect that there would be no more, or very few, guillotines on debates. Unfortunately, one was applied to the debate on water services legislation prior to Christmas but there are far fewer now than there were in the past. This is a House of Parliament and one of debate. There was a serious and wrong attempt to shut down that debate in Dáil and I want to know what pressures were put on this House to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">Like many more, I wish to raise the proposed purchase of Aer Lingus by IAG and the strange offer that is on the table concerning the Heathrow slots involving the chambers of commerce. I have huge regard for the chambers of commerce in the country, particularly the Shannon chamber, which is a long-running chamber that does fantastic work. The Taoiseach addressed a luncheon organised by the Shannon chamber only a few months ago. Is it appropriate that the slots would be entrusted, vetoed or whatever by chambers of commerce? I do not believe it is. This sale is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The best thing that can happen at this stage is for the Government to bring clarity and a finality to what has become a media circus. The Minister needs to get his working group to speed up its discussions. We all know what the inevitable outcome will be. The slots and the company will not be sold. It is as simple as that. There is far more work to be done in government than to continue on with this charade. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has enough on his plate dealing with issues related to deregulation and ensuring that some of our public transport companies could start operating more efficiently as opposed to having to invest so much time in something the outcome which we all know. I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in attendance on this and other issues in the transportation area, the outcome of which we do not know and which require some input, energy, discussion and deliberation. We all know what the outcome of this charade will be. It will not be sold.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I am a little surprised that other Members across the House did not raise the issue of the fear that is mounting around the new proposed special educational needs model. My inbox is full with e-mails since last Wednesday or Thursday. There was a large meeting in Galway prior to Christmas with about 100 teachers and parents in attendance who are very concerned that the new proposed model by the Minister will reduce the amount of resource hours and learning support that their children with special educational needs will get from September 2015. My request is simple. The Minister should slow down this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Much more debate and consultation needs to happen with the schools, who are the guardians of these children with special educational needs, in co-operation with their parents. I ask the Leader to urge the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, not to start this model by September 2015. In the meantime, she must reassure parents, teachers and the children themselves that their learning support and resource hours will not be cut. Let us face it; if any one of us has a child with special learning needs we want to give them a level playing field with their peers. We support a policy of inclusion in this country whereby we include children with special educational needs in mainstream classrooms. The only way to guarantee that, according to the education Act, is to provide learning support or resource teaching hours to bring such children to the required level. When one pulls that away, one disadvantages such children and that is the fear teachers, parents and children have currently. We do not want a minefield in this area. I had a very good debate with the Minister earlier on the junior certificate. She has done everything to allay fears on the matter. The issue has not gone away but we do not need a new problem in special educational needs to emerge without proper consultation.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I assure Senator Cullinane that Waterford will be next. It is worth reminding the House that 1.93 million people are currently at work and there was an overall increase in employment of 1.5% in the past 12 months. The current unemployment rate is 10.6% which is down, thankfully, from 15.1% in February 2012. The long-term unemployment rate is 6.4%, down from 8.1%. A total of 245,500 people are unemployed, which is down from 300,700.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">Senator Darragh O’Brien referred to IAG. No formal bid has been made. The Minister has said he will examine all the details and the Government will make a decision on the matter at that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The Senator also raised the issue of Fampyra, the drug for sufferers of multiple sclerosis. As Senator Darragh O’Brien mentioned, he raised the matter on several occasions. I have raised the matter with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and he came to the House for a debate on 25 November to discuss the matter. I assure the Senator that I will continue to raise the issue with the Minister. As Senator Barrett indicated, the Minister is making tremendous efforts in order to reduce the cost of drugs, which is very important. We all compliment him in that regard and hope he has success. I will again raise Fampyra with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Senator Bacik welcomed the announcement of the 250 jobs in Accenture, and the 100 extra gardaí who have commenced training in Templemore. That is to be welcomed also.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Senator Zappone spoke about homelessness and rent allowance. I understand the Labour Party Private Members’ motion next week will be on housing and the rental sector. We will have ample opportunity to discuss all such issues at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Senator Zappone also raised the issue of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. The Government has taken into consideration everything from the Constitution Convention but, of course, it is not bound by all the recommendations of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Senator Barrett outlined details on Aer Lingus and IAG, the discussions which took place at the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and an effort to gag the committee. He called on the takeover panel to back off. That is something which has been reiterated by other Members of the House also. I am sure that the committee will continue to try to have officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport come before it on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Senator Paul Coghlan raised the plight of the hen harrier. He was raising the issue of birds' nests last week. We heard Senator O'Sullivan again on seagulls.

          <p eId="para_279">Senator O'Donovan raised the issue of farmers on long-term farm assist payments and the red tape involved in securing payment and medical cards. I will certainly take the matter up with the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Senator Kelly raised the issue of the ambulance service and the need for firemen to get the necessary training to respond to accidents as well. We had a discussion on the health service and the ambulance service but we will endeavour to have a further debate on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Senator Norris questioned the necessity for Members to fob in and also outlined the plight of street children in the Philippines. As has been pointed out, the Pope was denied the opportunity to meet these children, which was most regrettable. Luke wrote that Jesus said, "Suffer little children to come unto me". Certainly, as has been pointed out by Fr. Cullen, who did such tremendous work in the Philippines, the children there were denied that.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Senator Colm Burke spoke against any move by the Government to sell its 25.1% share in Aer Lingus, which was mentioned by a number of Senators. His views were supported by Senator Conway in a later comment. Senator Burke also raised the question of the delay in providing housing adaptation grants in local authority houses. I agree with him. The medical officer has to come in and examine it and there are quite a number of delays where local authorities are concerned whereas those in private houses can get it done much more quickly and have their grants allocated to them. It is a problem. It is something that can be raised in the context of the debate on housing which we will have next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Senator Cullinane stated he objected last week to the taking without debate of the motion for the setting up of and for the terms of reference of a commission of inquiry into the findings of the Guerin report into Garda malpractice in the Cavan-Monaghan area. He left the House after that, he was not here for my response, there was no other objection to the matter at that time by any other Member in the House, and the Senator did not propose an amendment to the Order of Business. That was last week's business and I do not propose to go back over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Senator Whelan raised the issue of the bail laws. I agree totally with him. The level of crime committed by those who are out on bail is alarming. I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to have a debate on that matter. I note the Senator's points on the takeover panel and the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which Senator Barrett raised as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Senator O'Sullivan raised the 1916 commemorations and the role of the Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">We have 9,019 people in the Defence Forces, with 7,270 in the Army, 755 in the Air Corps and 994 in the Naval Service. There are ample numbers of people in the Defence Forces to be involved in any celebrations, wherever they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Senators Mullins and Naughton spoke about the €294 million allocation to local and regional roads. This is very important for local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the country. I note the points made by the Galway Senators about the bridge at Lough Atalia and the amount of money allocated for that. Senator Craughwell mentioned the 271 beds for the homeless that have been provided and are now being fully used. He also spoke of the plight of tenants in buy-to-let properties that have been taken over by banks. That issue can be discussed in the context of the Labour Private Members' motion next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Senator Landy raised the issue of Bus Éireann's removal of a service from Carrick-on-Suir to Dublin. I will certainly liaise with the Senator about this but it is a matter for Bus Éireann and I am sure it will respond on it. Senator MacSharry raised the matter of salaries for new Garda recruits and I note his points in that regard. Senator Noone spoke about home ownership and making renting a home more attractive. We will have the housing debate next week. Senator Mooney discussed the stand-off between Russia, the EU and the US, as well as the need for a diplomatic solution to the issue. I note his points on the Greek opposition to sanctions, which puts another spanner in the works. I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House and have a debate on what is a serious issue, as the Senator indicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> Senator Naughton also spoke about the working abroad expo which has run in the RDS for a number of years. It is encouraging that Irish companies are targeting Australia to recruit people and bring them back to this country. It is something to be welcomed by everybody. Senator Byrne mentioned last week's business. I have pointed out the position to Senator Cullinane. I had no correspondence from the Deputy in the other House who was mentioned.</p>

When the Minister and the Government have the necessary details, I am sure the decision will be expedited. Senator Healy Eames spoke about the special educational needs model and the requirement for further consultation between the Minister and all involved. The Senator had a very comprehensive Commencement debate with the Minister only today and perhaps she might put down another issue for discussion on the Commencement. Senator Brennan welcomed the announcement of 590 jobs in the past number of days. He pointed out that the unemployment rate has gone from 15.1% to 10.6%.

          <p eId="para_294">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_295">In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_296">"(3) The Minister shall, not later than 2 years after the date on which the Act is enacted, and again not later than 5 years after that date, carry out a review of the operation of this Act assessing, in particular, its consistency with international best practice in the field of gender recognition and its compliance with national, regional and international equality and human rights standards, and shall make a report to each House of the Oireachtas of his or her findings and conclusions resulting from the review.".</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the Minister of State. The amendment provides that the legislation will be reviewed within two years and again within five years to ensure it is in keeping with international best practice in the field of gender recognition and international human rights and equality standards. The Minister of State said on Second Stage that the Bill would be reviewed relatively soon if the marriage equality referendum was passed and that he would work night and day to table an amendment to reflect that result. I applaud and welcome his commitment to amend the Bill in this way. The amendment relates to the entirety of the legislation but because of the injustices of the past, it needs to maximise the potential of the law to protect the dignity and self-determination of transgender people. There is an ongoing debate as to how progressive the Bill is. The Minister of State has argued that it is, and I accept that this is the case in some respects, but it is not in others. If it adequately protects the right to self-determination and for a person to be recognised as a person before the law, a commitment to review the Bill in this way will demonstrate the Government's intention that our statutes will be human-rights-compliant on an ongoing basis. That is why I have moved the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T16:45:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_298">I strongly support the amendment, because it is important that we monitor the operation of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">This is very new and it would not have been contemplated 15 to 20 years ago, despite the heroic efforts of Dr. Lydia Foy and others. It is a new and fast-developing area and different European countries are developing at different levels and speeds. It is very important that we keep an eye on the way we are developing with regard to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I wish to put on the record of the House the way this is happening and I refer to a series of judgments. In the case of Goodwin <i>v.</i> United Kingdom 2002 - only 13 years ago - the unanimous judgment of the court was that in the 21st century, the right of transsexuals to personal development and to physical and moral security in the full sense enjoyed by others in society, cannot be regarded as a matter of controversy requiring the lapse of time to cast clearer light on the issues involved. That is unambiguous. The court found that the United Kingdom was in breach of its obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights because of its failure to legally recognise Christine Goodwin, a transgender woman, in her preferred female gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I refer to the case of Van Kück <i>v.</i> Germany in 2003, in which the court found in favour of the applicant stating that the case concerned her freedom to define herself as a female person. It described this as one of the most basic essentials of self-determination. That shows an extraordinary development since the war as this would have been absolutely unthinkable. I refer to the case of L <i>v</i>. Lithuania, in which the court found that states are required by their positive obligation under Article 8, to implement the recognition of the gender changes in post-operative transsexuals through, <i>inter alia</i>, amendments to their civil status data with its ensuing consequences. I refer to case of Schlumpf <i>v.</i> Switzerland 2009, which found on the right to personal self-fulfilment.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> I also refer to the Lydia Foy case in this country where the High Court gave its judgment. Mr. Justice McKechnie said, "I must conclude that by reason of the absence of any provision which would enable the acquired identity of Dr. Foy to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction, the respondent State is in breach of its positive obligations under Article 8 of the convention." He made a declaration that the Irish Civil Registration Act was incompatible with the ECHR, the European Convention on Human Rights, because of its failure to provide for recognition of transgender persons in their preferred gender. </p>
          <p eId="para_303"> The EU gender recast directive of 2006 stated that the Court of Justice has held that the scope of the principle of equal treatment for men and women also applies to discrimination arising from the gender reassignment of a person. In its concluding observations, the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 2008 recommended that the state party should also recognise the right of transgender persons to a change of gender by permitting the issuance of new birth certificates. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muiznieks, in his letter to the Minister for Social Protection in November 2012, said that divorce should not be a necessary condition for gender recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> We are moving very rapidly. I will not refer to any further cases because I think I have put sufficient information on the record of the House to show that this is an area which has seen astonishingly rapid growth. Like homosexuality, this subject was regarded as unmentionable and people were afraid of it. I may have said before that I remember as a child being on the Limerick bus and seeing a woman, as I thought, with very hairy legs and heavy tweeds, being taken off by the police because she wore a skirt. That was the attitude in those days and when I was a young person, a young adult. These were people to be taken away and concealed and hidden and treated as mentally deficient, psychologically ill and all the rest. Now we have this tremendous body of legislation showing that these are human beings, citizens and people who are not mentally ill, who have a right and an increasing volume of human rights. This Bill is an improvement and the amendments put down by myself and colleagues will show that there is still a way to go in this legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_305"> I will conclude on this note. We are in a situation which is changing rapidly, where new understandings are coming into play and, in particular, where people have the opportunity to meet with transsexual people. There is nothing like putting a human face on something and hearing the human experience. In light of this rapidly developing situation I believe the amendment is appropriate, and the amounts of time provided for are very reasonable. The amendment states, "... not later than 2 years after the date on which the Act is enacted ...". That gives time to assess. It further states, "... not later than 5 years after that date, carry out a review of the operation ...". Those are eminently sensible suggestions, and I cannot see any good reason the Government should object.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">There would be a view that there are inherent flaws in this legislation and if, as seems likely, the Government will not accept the amendments being put before the House, this amendment would go some way to at least addressing question marks that have arisen about the drafting of the Bill and the substantive nature of some of the proposals contained therein. If the Bill is to pass in its current form, notwithstanding with Government amendments being accepted, which do not address some of the basic issues raised on Second Stage and no doubt will be repeated on Committee Stage, there might be some merit in the Minister considering this particular amendment. It is not without precedent. It happens in other legislation where there is a review period involved. In fact, I am a little surprised it is not included in the Bill as presented. I do not want to labour the point other than to say that I will support the overall concept and substantive nature of this amendment.</p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T16:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_307">I welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome also the groups represented in the Gallery who I know have worked very hard on progressing this legislation. I refer to TENI and LGBT Noise, among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Senators Zappone and Norris, with customary eloquence, have put the case for a review very strongly, and I agree. The idea of a review is a sensible one and would address some of the issues raised with us in briefings by groups. As Senator Norris said, this is an area that is changing very rapidly. Indeed, since the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, which my colleague, Senator Moloney, was on, reported in January of last year there have already been changes. Some of the recommendations it made represented best practice at the time. We now see changes in Denmark, for example, which has brought forward more progressive legislation. It would be sensible to have some sort of review period built in and to enable us all to examine what has developed in terms of international best practice in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> The Senators proposing the amendment spoke in particular of the marriage equality referendum. If passed, and we all hope it will be - I will be working very hard to ensure its passage - I have already said I believe the best place to amend the provisions effectively on forced divorce in this Bill would be in the marriage equality referendum implementing legislation. I put the case on Second Stage, and I have put it both to the Tánaiste and the Minister present, that it would be appropriate to delete the provisions in sections 8 to 10, inclusive. Putting in a review period will enable us to ensure that there were no further problems in terms of the issue of marriage. </p>
          <p eId="para_310"> A review period would also enable us to address the issues around age that have been expressed to us, in particular protections for those under 16 who are currently not catered for directly in the Bill. The Oireachtas committee had recommended that there should be guidelines on how best to support transgender young people in schools. There are real concerns about bullying and discrimination. People have spoken to me about particular difficulties for young transgender people in schools. If schools are not supporting young people in expressing their rights, a review will enable us to ensure that, if necessary, legislation would be put in place to require schools to do that. In the meantime, guidelines for schools are essential, as the Oireachtas committee recommended, but the idea of a review is a sensible one.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I, too, welcome some of the representative groups in the Gallery and thank them for the support they have given to both Government and Opposition Members of the Dáil and the Seanad on this important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I support the amendment, which is being put because a number of us believe there are serious flaws and deficiencies in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">There is no doubt whatsoever that we will have to come back and deal with those issues some time in the future. What we want is to deal with those issues at the start because there are fundamental issues of human rights, civil rights and potential constitutional issues which arise also. I would work on the basis that a large number of constructive amendments have been tabled by the Opposition that will address some of those very real concerns. Why not accept those amendments today? Let us debate them. Many of them are reasonable and necessary if we want a truly rights-based Bill. This Bill is about gender recognition and yet there are a number of exclusions, including some people under the age of 16 and non-binary identity is completely excluded. That is the first problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> The issue of divorce was raised by Senator Bacik and others. There is no guarantee yet, perhaps the Minister of State can clarify today, that these issues will be dealt with to our satisfaction in the marriage equality legislation when that comes before the House. That would be a step in the right direction and would certainly go some way to dealing with that problem but we should deal with it today. </p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Senator Norris dealt with pathology and medical recognition. That is absolutely wrong. It should not be happening. It is a relic of how we dealt with these issues in the past. It is a violation of the human rights of transgender people. Very sensible amendments have been tabled to deal with these issues. Because of those core concerns which are shared by other Senators and certain members of the Government and certainly the transgender community and its representative groups, it is necessary to have an amendment such as this accepted. It is unfortunate because one of the concerns of the groups is that the Bill will be forced through without those sensible amendments being accepted and we will have a flawed Bill rather than a landmark human rights, civil rights Bill which genuinely gives recognition to all citizens in the State rather than the step forward that this is but not going far enough. For those reasons I support the amendment but only reluctantly because we can better deal with those issues by the Government accepting many of the amendments which have been tabled by Members of the Opposition. </p>

          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_316">I thank the Minister of State for meeting us yesterday to discuss amendments to the Bill. He is dealing with this in the best possible way that it can be dealt with. I commend those who have put their names and their personal lives on the line and who are sitting in the Visitors Gallery, in order to see Ireland come into the 21st century dragged kicking and screaming, as it were. I commend him and the Tánaiste for bringing the Bill forward. However, like many before me, Senator Paschal Mooney has pointed out that it is unlikely, experience shows this, that we will get many amendments through during this debate. I know the Minister of State is open to accepting them where possible but life being what it is we may not see them go through.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> This amendment is probably the most important amendment to the entire Bill. It seeks to open the door for a review and to keep it open for constant reviews. In passing Bills we, as legislators, need to be aware of the overarching principles of transparency, fairness and reasonableness. The gender recognition application process has to work for the people using it. It cannot impose excessive delays. We have heard already of one young man who has waited four years for medical certification. That is unacceptable. There must be consistency in decision making and that will create its own problems. There must be public confidence in the system. In short, transgender persons and their families must have confidence in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> As Ireland is one of the last countries to enact gender recognition legislation we must safeguard against complacency. We need to be vigilant in making sure we never breach human rights law again. What Dr. Lydia Foy had to go through to bring us here today is unbelievable. From that point of view the express needs of the transgender person are and must always be centre stage. How the Bill works in reality for the transgender person will have to be the subject of ongoing reviews at the two and five-year periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I support the amendment. If the Minister of State accepts no other amendment it will give comfort to those particularly in the area of enforced divorce, an issue on which, not so long ago, we saw bitter disputes in every street and town in every county when the Government tried to introduce divorce legislation. Now we have part of a Bill where if one member of a married couple decides to trans, we are saying, "Sorry, one has got to get divorced if one wants the recognition." I do not wish to delay the House other than to ask the Minister of State to take this amendment on board. At least that would give me some comfort that we will get a second chance to come back here. </p>

          <p eId="para_320">It is my pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, to the House. It is nearly eight years since the High Court first ruled that the Irish State was in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights because it did not have a mechanism to legally recognise the preferred gender of transgender individuals. I am happy to see the Government moving to rectify an obvious anomaly in the law. As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland remains the last of the 27 EU nations without any legal provision to recognise transgender or intersex people, therefore, this Bill is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I am happy to discuss the rationale for my amendments. In a country where divorce was only made legal in 1996 it is ludicrous that it is about to be made compulsory for some. The single criteria which demands that applicants be single if they are to apply for recognition in their preferred gender, forces married transgender people to choose between their family and their identity. Imagine being told that the State will not legally recognise one's identity unless one first divorces one's husband or wife. The explanation given for this is that otherwise it would allow for the existence of same sex marriages which are currently not allowed by law in Ireland. This requirement fails to acknowledge that transgender families exist and fails to offer their marriage the constitutional protection offered to every other marriage in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> What is the position of the forced divorce requirement under the International Human Rights Convention? In its concluding comments last year on the Irish periodic report under the covenant on civil and political rights, the UN human rights committee said it was concerned that the new heads of a gender recognition Bill, approved by Cabinet in 2014, retains the requirement for married transgender persons to dissolve the existing marriage or civil partnership to have their preferred gender formally recognised. The UN human rights committee urges our Government to ensure the right to legal recognition of gender without the requirement of dissolution of marriage or civil partnership. Under the provisions of the Bill, in line with Irish divorce law, a transgender-----</p>

This particular legislation is one that truly merits a review. I would hope the Minister of State would look favourably on this amendment.</p>

I hope it will be revisited much earlier in line with the Tánaiste's commitment. As soon as the referendum is completed we should revisit it, but, if not, at least with the amendment there is some type of safeguard to ensure it must be looked at again within the next two years.

First, I do not propose to accept the amendment. Section 6 provides for the Minister to produce a report on the operation of the legislation on an annual basis. It is clearly important that the impact and effectiveness of this ground-breaking legislation be carefully assessed over time. Senator Norris referred to the rapid change that is occurring.

It has been a priority for the Tánaiste to ensure that the legislation would be brought to the Houses and given effect this year. It is important that we work in co-operation when dealing with legislation that is extremely complex and new. The amendment is practical and reasonable, and I am delighted to be able to accept it. We had discussions with the Senators earlier but I could not give indications because, as Senator Mooney knows, a long process of negotiations and discussions must take place.

          <p eId="para_354">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_355">In page 5, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_356">“ “child” means a person under the age of 18 years;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I welcome our visitors to the Visitors' Gallery and I congratulate Senator Zappone. I did not speak on that amendment because I intend to say a great deal on this substantive point. I do not plan to speak on other matters, but this is an issue that is very close to my heart. I thank my colleagues Senators Mac Conghail and Zappone for supporting me in the grouping of amendments I tabled. I see that colleagues have similar intentions with the amendments they have put forward. I also thank the Minister for engaging with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I will outline the reason for this amendment. I do not intend to push it to a vote today but I intend to press it, or a similar wording of it, to a vote on Report Stage as I am very passionate about this issue. The rationale behind the amendments I have tabled derives from what will be Article 42A.1 of the Constitution, depending on the Supreme Court judgment, which states: "The State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and shall, as far as practicable, by its laws protect and vindicate those rights." In my <i>Irish Mirror</i> column yesterday I spoke about Ireland's shocking record in respect of the treatment, welfare and well-being of children in Ireland, especially vulnerable children whose vulnerability we appear to compound systematically.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I note the significance of the successful passage of the children's rights referendum on 10 November 2012, which sought to incorporate into Irish constitutional law the principles that children have rights as individual human beings, independent of adults and that their best interests and opinions are vital when important decisions are being made about their lives. The Irish people have spoken out and spoken up for children. To my great frustration, these principles, which Ireland is already bound to respect under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, have not yet taken constitutional effect because we are still awaiting a final decision from the Supreme Court on the legal challenge to the referendum. I am very aware of the pressure and backlog of cases at the Supreme Court but part of me wonders why, after 26 months of delay, we do not have a public outcry. </p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Despite a systemic change of mind set in recent years, we still have a long way to go to fully embrace the urgency of children's rights. It is very clear to me, having actively engaged at all levels of the consultation and debate around the wording of the constitutional amendment, that it was the intention of the Legislature and of the people in passing the referendum to ensure that children's rights are vindicated in the Constitution so that their rights will be safeguarded and vindicated in all future legislation. The aforementioned UN convention, which Ireland ratified in 1992, sets out an integrated and holistic approach to the rights of children and is internationally accepted as a model of implementation at domestic level. As far as I am concerned, in the drafting of any Bill which impacts on children's lives, it is now incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration, the views of the child are heard when key decisions are being made about the child's life and that the evolving capacity of the child is facilitated. I believe that this Bill, specifically section 11 as currently drafted, fails to safeguard and vindicate children's rights in accordance with international law and the constitutional provisions. In fact, the rights of children under the age of 16 are not even open to consideration. </p>
          <p eId="para_361"> I will refer now to amendments Nos. 15 and 17. Gender recognition is an established human right to which children, as individual rights holders, should be entitled. In preparing for this debate today, I have looked for commentary or evidence about the age at which gender identity develops and was struck by the real dearth of research into transgender children. In fact, there is no incidence or prevalence data from Ireland or the UK on the number of transgender young people under 18. Of the research that was available, I noted that some paediatric specialists put the age of gender identity in children, whether transgender or not, at two or three. Other research cites gender identity development as occurring between three and five years of age. Elizabeth Reilly <i>et al</i> published a very interesting piece of qualitative research on the issue which solicited the views of transgender adults about the needs of gender-variant children and their parents in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy - the peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Routledge - in 2013. The researchers found that 94% of transgender adults had identified their gender before the age of 18, some 48% had identified their gender between zero and five years of age, while 44% had identified their gender between the age of six and 14. Only 2% identified their gender between 13 and 18 and only 2% after the age of 18, while 4% of the respondents did not reply. That is a pretty good indication of what period of a child's life is important in terms of gender identification and goes to the essence of what we are talking about here. </p>
          <p eId="para_362"> There was a time in Ireland, during the last century, when it was widely believed that people did not become aware of their sexual orientation until they reached adulthood. It was commonly believed that this was something a person decided or determined but thankfully, we are more enlightened as a society now and more understanding of the reality. When it comes to gender recognition, however, we are still back in the last century and that way of thinking. I would like us to understand that it is actually at an earlier age that one's gender identity is realised and understood. We need to accept that fact. That is why I have an issue with this Bill, which actively excludes children under 16 from its provisions for making an application for a gender recognition certificate. It denies outright any consideration of their best interests in the context of their personal circumstances. I believe that this runs contrary to the best interest of the child principle. </p>
          <p eId="para_363"> A good example of how this outright denial has serious implications for the transgender and intersex child is seen in the S <i>v</i>. Bord Uchtála case of 2009. That case involved an intersex child, born abroad, who had been registered as female at birth, was subject to a foreign adoption order and brought to Ireland to live. Upon examination by medical experts in Ireland and the United States, it was concluded that the child would most likely identify as a male and the decision was taken by the adoptive parents to raise the child as a boy. The parents sought an amendment of the register of foreign adoptions so that the child's paperwork would reflect his gender of rearing and so that he could be registered at the local boy's school. The Adoption Board refused the application on the basis that it did not believe it had the authority to grant this request. On judicial review in the High Court, Mr. Justice Sheehan granted the request but the difficulty is that this was an <i>ex tempore</i> judgment and not a precedent. I am concerned that a different judge, even in similar circumstances, might feel that he or she lacked the authority to grant such an order, given the discourse on this issue. In fact, I am worried that by introducing this legislation and being deliberately silent on children under 16, we are sending a clear message to the courts that they should never grant such an order. I will be seeking advice on this because a judge in a future case, similar to the one to which I referred, may find it extremely difficult to make a similar order. In the aforementioned case, those involved - both the parents and the child - agreed with the order. With this legislation, we are saying, "We know best. Go to a girl's school". We would be telling a young boy to go to a girl's school because we know best what is good for him and what is in his best interests. I believe that the best interests of that child were served by allowing him to be identified with the gender of his wishes, with which his parents concurred. </p>
          <p eId="para_364"> In terms of international precedent, in October 2013 the Argentinian authorities granted a female identification card and amended birth certificate to a transgender six year old Luna, formerly Manuel, under that country's ground-breaking gender identity law which allows people to change their name and sex without approval from either a doctor or a judge. Under Argentinian gender identity law, individuals have the right to the recognition of their gender identity. Individuals are also legally entitled to the free development of their person according to their gender identity and to be treated according to that identity, particularly to be identified in that way in the documents proving their identity, including the first name, image and sex recorded there. According to the law, gender identity is understood as the internal and individual way in which a gender is perceived by persons that can correspond, or not, to the gender assigned at birth including the personal experience of the body. This can involve modifying bodily appearance or functions but it can also include other expressions of gender, such as dress, ways of speaking and gestures. </p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I have heard this legislation described as progressive but as I speak, similar legislation is being debated in Malta which definitely is progressive. That legislation takes into consideration the lived life which is what we should be aspiring to. In Malta, a decision is allowed up to the age of 14. I thought that perhaps Malta would not face the same issues as we do in the context of single sex schools but I discovered that the majority of State-run secondary schools there are also single sex. Malta is able to deal with this issue and ensure that it acts in the best interest of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I am particularly concerned about the mechanisms we need to have in place to minimise the challenges currently faced by transsexual and intersex children in Ireland. Examples of challenges are the segregated nature of our educational system and the requirement that parents must submit birth certificates for registration. Education, on which there is an amendment tabled, is a specific area to be considered but there are other settings in which children experience challenges. We may find a work-around.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> In preparing for this debate, I was looking for examples. In California in January 2014, Assembly Bill 1266, or the School Success and Opportunity Act, came into effect for K-12 students, who are between four and 19, in the public school system. The law inserted the following provision into the existing legislation: "A pupil shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil’s records." There was opposition to this but there was a vote and it was included in the regulations. In response to the new provision, Masen Davis, executive director of the Transgender Law Center in San Francisco, stated: "Now, every transgender student in California will be able to get up in the morning knowing that when they go to school as their authentic self they will have the same fair chance at success as their classmates."</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Transsexual and intersex children are inherently vulnerable because of their age and lack of legal protection. We have an opportunity to lessen this vulnerability but instead we choose to turn a blind eye or put up an artificial barrier, despite the fact that evidence suggests, and adults have said, that it is in children's younger years that they identify what is occurring. I am thinking of the six year old child who has clearly articulated his preferred gender and which has been fully embraced by his parents, friends, extended family and community. Is this young child, a boy, really going to be forced to go through a girls' school wearing a girl's uniform and using the wrong name and pronouns to gain access to the education available in his locality? That is what we are doing to children in these circumstances. Are we really preparing to stand over legislation that in the case of the boy in question would cause unnecessary distress, embarrassment and humiliation, and potentially serious psychological harm, for ten years before he is eligible to apply to have his gender identity recognised? Legislation that fails to listen to the voice of children or consider their best interests is not legislation I want to stand over.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Where a child has clearly articulated views regarding his or her preferred gender, or where the child has an intersex condition that might merit a change in gender and legal recognition, he or she should be facilitated in achieving this end, especially where all parties agree. We do not even have a system where all parties can agree. In the amendments we have tabled, we have sought to find ways in which all parties can agree and, where they do not, where disagreement can be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> According to the Bill as currently drafted, 16 and 17 year olds will need an order from the court allowing them to apply to the Minister for a gender recognition certificate. The amendment I have tabled puts the best interest of the child front and centre in the court's consideration, which is where it should be. I do not believe it should be a matter for any medical practitioner or psychologist. We should allow cases to be dealt with in court to ensure the child's rights are upheld and protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The amendment is to secure the consent of the person referred to in subsection (4)(a) since the current drafting means the court has no authority to override the non-consent of an individual. We need to have the measure I propose because we need to adhere to the principle of the best interest of the child. We do this with other types of legislation, such as adoption legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> For me, the current provisions fly in the face of the requirement to ensure in our laws that the child's best interest should determine the process. Furthermore, the fact that the process for achieving gender recognition is open only to 16 and 17 year olds on consent does not make sense to me. Under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, 16 and 17 year old children can choose, if they wish, to seek medical services as part of a medical transition process in their own right. They have full consent to go through the medical processes, yet the Bill requires parental consent to apply for a gender recognition certificate. The thinking is that children can undergo any medical procedure they wish but, to get the piece of paper, we need to protect them and involve their parents. It just does not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I am genuinely concerned about the absence of a provision ensuring the best interest of the child. When the general scheme of the legislation was available, the Ombudsman for Children advised that, if we had this process, an "illogical situation would arise in which the State would countenance a young person receiving the relevant medical treatment on the strength of his or her own consent, yet that consent would be insufficient to obtain legal recognition of the young person’s preferred gender and the outcome of that treatment".</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I hope the constitutional amendment will come into effect shortly. In any case, we have an obligation, having ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to ensure we have the best interest of the child at the heart of all our legislation. That we are silent about those aged 16 and below would not allow for the court case I instanced or any other court cases in which a judge could use his or her discretion. As legislators, we cannot stand over that. We need to go back to the drawing board and consider the best interest of the child and find a mechanism on which everyone can agree, allowing children to live their lives as they desire. Can one imagine trying to live one's life as another somebody with a different identity? One might regard oneself as a "she" but be called "he" and be expected to conform by wearing certain clothing. We know clothing is a big issue for young people in schools. Are we really to deny their voice, best interests and what we now know about children, that is, that they have an evolving capacity and are able to make these decisions? We can find a structure that safeguards them and regards their best interest as paramount.</p>

          <from>Senator Averil Power<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_375">I have raised this issue at length on Second Stage, so I will not repeat everything I said then. I share the concerns raised. Under the legislation, there is no system whatsoever or arrangement by which somebody under 16 can obtain a general recognition certificate. The process for those over 16 is incredibly cumbersome. It will be next to impossible for many young people to satisfy the criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Senator van Turnhout mentioned Argentina, where there is no age limit. Countries that originally legislated with age limits are now reconsidering them with a view to introducing more progressive legislation. We should be starting from a more progressive position rather than providing in legislation what other countries provided ten or 15 years ago. As has been stated, young transgender people know from the age of three, four or five what their true gender is. It becomes a daily struggle or challenge for them when it is not recognised by the State, schools or State agencies with which they interact. We have the opportunity to change this and help a particularly vulnerable group of young people. Among this group, the suicide rate is frightening and much higher than that for any other group. All we are being asked to do is recognise who they are. It is not much to ask for. It is incredibly unfortunate and unfair that there is no provision whatsoever for anybody under 16. Those over 16 should be able to make a decision in their own right and should not be subjected to the incredibly cumbersome process set out in the Bill. As has been pointed out, they can consent to medical treatment at that point or have surgery, which has a far greater impact on their lives and is much harder to reverse than being given a piece of paper by the State. It seems irrational that somebody would be able to consent to medical treatment at 16 but not get a gender recognition certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Amendment No. 8 will ensure that those over 16 will be treated as adults and use a process set out in the legislation for those aged 18 and older. There should be a process by which young people under 16 can obtain a gender recognition certificate. It is right that this would involve parental consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Consequently, while I think the process the Minister of State has set out for 16 and 17 year olds is overly cumbersome for a young adult who can make autonomous decisions in other more significant areas, it would be fair enough for those under 16. I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for this. I first seek feedback from the Minister of State as to why nothing has been done for anybody under 16. As the process as provided for is so difficult to satisfy, why would the Minister of State not be satisfied with 14 and 15 year olds being able to use that process in cases where the 14 year olds themselves know what are their preferred gender, if their parents consent and if they can satisfy the court it is the appropriate course of action for them? As I stated, there is no age requirement at all in other countries and I seek the Minister of State's feedback because this is a crucial issue for a particularly vulnerable group of young people who, as the Bill stands, are being let down.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">I support both speakers and Senator van Turnhout in particular, who has laid out many reasons and has provided a number of pieces of evidence in order that the Minister of State might consider accepting the different amendments she has tabled, as well as her powerful, elegant and eloquent argument for ensuring that Members are attentive to the best interests of the child. In addition, she has asked the question, as has Senator Power, as to why there is silence. Members must hear from the Minister of State in some way to fill that silence. Amendment No. 8 in particular may approach the issue from a slightly different angle from all those tabled by Senator van Turnhout in particular. In case that bar is too high, this is why it would be particularly useful to have this review and the two-year period the Minister of State has indicated he would be willing to accept. However, as Senator Power has stated, were the Minister of State at least to accept amendment No. 8, it simply suggests that those who were aged 16 and over would be getting recognised on the same grounds as are those who are 18 and over, which already is provided for in the Bill. I support this for all the reasons that have been put forward.</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_380">First, I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to what has been said and, as he did with amendment No. 1, to reflect on the powerful contribution made by Senator van Turnhout and others on this issue. I hope he was moved by the contribution because it pertains to the reason I am not in a position to give the Bill an enthusiastic welcome. Even though the Minister of State has labelled it as being groundbreaking, I perceive it to be a step forward. The reason I am unable to call it groundbreaking or to give it an enthusiastic welcome is because it excludes explicitly children under the age of 16. This is one core concern both I and many others in the Chamber have. This goes right to the heart of Members' concerns because this State has come through a children's referendum that was to establish children's rights. I supported the referendum and Sinn Féin supported the Government position at the time. We did so with reservations because many people were telling our members that this again was merely aspirational and did not go far enough. Again, while Sinn Féin considered that constitutional amendment to be a step forward, this is a Bill about gender recognition that explicitly excludes children. The account given by Senator van Turnhout about the six year old boy brought Members right to the heart of that young child and other young children who will be placed in a similar position, in which they will not have their gender recognised with all the trauma both Members and the Minister of State are aware this will bring to them. On hearing the account given of that child who is a boy but who will be forced to go to a girls' school and to wear girls' uniforms, it is absolutely appalling that this would happen in present-day Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The point being made by Senator van Turnhout was that even if the parent consents or both parents consent, it still would not be enough. As there is no good reason for this, I would be interested to hear what is the Government's defence of this omission. I cannot understand how anyone could stand over not including children under 16. I accept the Minister of State has created a pathway for 16 and 17 year olds, about which I have concerns in respect of parental consent and the pathologising and medicalising of the process. Perhaps this sort of model should have been considered for children under 16, albeit with improvements to deal with some of the issues I have just raised. As did all Members, I have met many of the trans groups and by and large, parents are the chief advocates for their children. They are hugely supportive of their children and want the best for them. Moreover, a child knows his or her own gender. As the Minister of State and I have our gender recognised, why should it be the case that the gender of a young boy or girl is not being recognised? How can any government or state stand over that? This is what these amendments seek to do. Amendment No. 22 proposes the deletion of lines five to 11 on page 12 and their substitution with text I will not read out. Its purpose is to ensure that under circumstances in which there is a child applicant and a parent who will not consent to the process, the court may dispense with his or her consent if he or she refuses to give it, when proceeding with that process would be in the best interests of the child. I also support this amendment, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> A number of amendments have been grouped together. I will leave it at that because other Senators wish to contribute, because Members have heard a lengthy but moving and heartfelt contribution from Senator van Turnhout to which I do not believe any Member could add and because all the amendments seek to do the same thing, namely, to remove the age requirement in respect of those aged 16 to 18 and to ensure that everybody, including children, will have their gender recognised. The point Members made earlier was that they will be obliged to deal with this issue again. Whatever the configuration of the next Government may be, if the Minister of State is not in a position to accept these amendments today or to come back on Report Stage with his own amendments and if the Minister of State proceeds with what is a flawed Bill and a denial of the human and civil rights of many children in the State, Members would then be obliged to return to this issue. My party would be absolutely committed to amending any future legislation or bringing forward amending legislation to vindicate the rights of all of those children who would not be supported, to put it mildly, were the Bill in its current form to be passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">Nothing could illustrate more clearly the rapidly changing nature of this debate than the legislation that currently is in place or being discussed in Argentina, Malta and Denmark. Matters are moving ahead rapidly and our understanding is also developing quickly. It appears to me that the recognition and understanding by individuals of their own gender identity comes before their understanding and identification of sexual orientation. Gender identification comes at a significantly earlier stage and this poses difficulties for young people. For example, let us consider first the question of people aged 16 and 17. The legislation as currently framed presents almost insuperable obstacles to them getting gender recognition legally in respect of their documents. They have four hurdles to pass, the first of which is parental consent. Then there is a certificate from the primary medical treating practitioner to be followed by a second certificate from an endocrinologist. What on earth an endocrinologist has to do with the price of eggs is beyond me but I presume this is some fantasy from the Department. Moreover, the endocrinologist is to have no connection with the child, which is daft. I would have thought that someone providing a certificate for a child would need to have some connection with the child but there is to be none.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">It would have to be a complete stranger and an endocrinologist or a psychiatrist. God preserve us. Finally, the fourth requirement is a court order. One might get one or two of those but one would have a hell of a hard job getting four of them all together. I just do not see it. That presents a really problematic barrier for people and that is likely to make recognition inaccessible for people aged 16 and 17, and children under 16 would be excluded completely from being legally recognised whether or not they have their parents’ consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> I am not going to rehearse what Senator van Turnhout presented magisterially to this House. She provided a wealth of examples, court cases and so on and so forth. I know of some of the cases but there is no point in repeating or rehashing them, except to say I agree with every single word that she said.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> With regard to people under the age of 16, this is where the problem really starts. This is a crucial point. It is a fundamental issue. Children are at the most vulnerable stage. They are as vulnerable to being picked on as white blackbirds, as a bit odd or whatever else, in particular if they are placed in a quandary by the school authorities who refuse to recognise their gender identity. That points them out and puts a spotlight on them. The schools can decide they are not going to negotiate either with the individual or the groups, because they have no legal standing. As Senator van Turnhout said, “we decide for you”.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Then there is the very practical question of gender appropriate facilities such as changing rooms and lavatories. Another issue is wearing the right uniform. Why should a boy be made wear a skirt? Why should a girl be made wear trousers if that is what they are? There is also the question of bullying. People are obviously going to be highlighted by the discrepancy which will make them more susceptible to bullying, which leads to an increased rate of suicide. That is all I have to say because it has been said so well by my colleagues. I endorse every word that has been said and I hope the Minister will take it into consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I would love to be able to use some of the very eloquent words that have been used here today in some of the very moving speeches. All I can really say is that puberty is the most confusing time in one’s life. It is a long time ago since I went through puberty but I still remember it and it will haunt me to the grave. Could one imagine being forced to come to that age in life in a gender that is not one’s recognised gender?</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> There has been much talk today about provisions for people up to the age of 16. Thank God for the media today and the speed at which information comes to us. I can inform the Minister that right now in Sweden it is being planned to split gender recognition into two areas, legal gender recognition and medical treatment. The main points are the separation of the legal and the medical into two different laws. Individuals will be able to get a legal change of gender at 15 or from the age of 12 for children with parental consent. <b>
						</b>The gender reassignment scheme is allowed from the age of 15 and for intersex children from under 12<b>.</b></p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I had huge difficulty with this entire subject when first confronted by it. I remember discussing the matter with my wife who is a children’s nurse. She explained to me that from time to time children are born and it is far from clear what gender they are. A consultant or other doctor steps in and makes a decision and the child is pumped with hormones in order to make the child whatever that person said they were. We must be extremely careful. What we are doing with the Bill is putting barriers and constraints around the type of case Senator van Turnhout adverted to, where everybody, including the dogs in the streets, agree that a child has been misgendered and wants to trans. The parents want it to happen. One could ask why we want to force them to go through puberty to the age of 16 before they can make a decision. I remember puberty and the experience will follow me to the grave. I challenge anyone present to say it did not drive them insane also.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, to the House. I listened to the earlier Stage of the debate. I thank him for agreeing to consider amendment No. 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> Like others who have spoken I will not pretend I am an expert but I have done a lot of reading, looked at submissions and I have listened to people. I wish to refer to research and I ask Members to think about it. I have been dealing with children all my life, in particular small children in Montessori schools and preschool children. Gender identity is usually formed by the age of three and is extremely difficult to change after that. Formation commonly concludes between the ages of four and six. That might be startling but it is referenced. I will not bore the House with all the details but that reference in particular is from<b>
						</b>Zucker. Another article of interest was in <i>The Nurse Practitioner</i> journal. Gender identity is influenced by others, by social interactions and a child’s own personal interest. Understanding gender identity can be broken down into four parts: understanding the concept of gender and learning gender roles, standards and stereotypes; identifying with parents; and forming gender preferences. The final one is particularly important. Barbara Newmann examined development through life from a psychological perspective. I do not pretend to be an expert on the matter but one reads the experts when one wants information. A three-year old can identify himself or herself as a boy or girl but they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender. That could probably apply to every single one of us. We do not fully understand the implications of gender and we leave it to the medical experts in various fields.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I welcome the Bill. It is a major a major step forward for the Minister of State to bring the Bill to the House. We cannot get everything right on day one but we must leave the door open to make changes. I welcome in particular the review. I hope the Minister of State will be able to reduce the age before the review. Could he give a commitment that the matter will be open for consideration given the support provided by studies dating from Freud, Piaget, Kohlberg<b>
						</b>and others? There was denial for so long and it is only now that we are tackling the issue. Other countries are more advanced than we are but I will not get into the details. Two countries that are quite advanced in this regard are Argentina and the Netherlands. I have a review of the situation in various countries. We are playing catch up. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. We can look at what has worked elsewhere, and what has been changed in other countries. I urge the Minister of State to examine the matter in depth.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I thank Members for their contributions. I can feel the passion and how strongly Senator van Turnhout feels. Senator Norris indicated at the outset on the first amendment how quickly the situation is changing, and how different the legislation would be if we were doing it ten years ago or even nine months ago. By constantly redrafting the legislation on each Stage we can examine the situation in various countries. We might not be happy with certain elements of legislation elsewhere and, in turn, they might quote legislation coming through this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> When I tried to inform myself on the issue in advance of the Bill’s publication I noted that an expert panel had recently been proposed. That is an indication of how far we have moved in this regard. I do not see the debate as being combative or the Government being defensive. Each Member of the Seanad is trying to work as best he or she can in the circumstances to produce the best legislation possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Yesterday, I read from a letter that captured the Bill. Senator Norris has submitted many proposals. I know of the bullying that occurs in schools because it happened to members of my family. I have seen the effects that bullying has on children, so I hear the Senator loud and clear, but the Bill cannot cover everything. People referred to education, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> The Bill does not offer a position as to when an issue of transgendering arises during the course of a person's life. Rather, it seeks to provide for recognition of the position of a mature person who has settled and has a solemn intention to live in his or her preferred gender for the remainder of his or her life. That is what we are trying to achieve with this Bill. I was moved by the Senator's contribution, but no matter how moved I am, we must frame legislation in our current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I will address a number of direct remarks. Where an intersex child is reassigned, he or she can be dealt with under the Civil Registration Act's section on corrections of error. We will keep this element under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Regarding amendments Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, the Bill is based on the Attorney General's advice. Senator Norris will disagree with our position, but what we have all been striving to do is to protect children. The validation process requires two hurdles rather than four, so that was probably a slip of the tongue. Can we wait for every judgment that is due in all other jurisdictions?</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I agree with Senator Craughwell about the first amendment being important, but this legislation addresses a vast number of issues. After we have seen how it works in practice in its first few years, we can amend it. Besides that, we must also watch how the situation is changing. People have articulated their opinions strongly, but I am not in a position to agree with them today.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> The decision to seek gender recognition from the State is a significant one that will have important implications for a person throughout his or her life. Therefore, it is important that anyone seeking a gender recognition certificate is doing so in the full knowledge of the consequences and has the necessary maturity to make that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Following the joint committee's report of January 2014, the Tánaiste secured Government approval for a Bill to reduce the minimum age to 16 years while requiring those aged under 18 years to have the consent of their parents or guardians, bar in exceptional circumstances to be approved by court order. Senator Norris went through this matter in detail. I accept his points but I cannot move on them today. I have heard him loud and clear. I have argued and discussed many issues at length with Senators. The Bill's provision on a minimum age goes well beyond the legislative measures in many other EU member states. While I can understand people's arguments for wanting to push it even further, I do not propose to accept these amendments. Nor will I table amendments on this matter on Report Stage. The review mechanism will be of assistance, though. I do not necessarily agree with the Senators' sentiments, but I can see where people are coming from on this issue. I may be proven wrong in time, but I am not in a position to accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I will be reasonably brief, because it is clear that the Minister of State will not accept the amendments. However, he is not quite so clear on whether he will not consider the matter for Report Stage. I urge him to do so. This is a radical series of amendments, but "radical" just means that it goes to the root of the problem. It comes from the Latin radix, meaning "root". We should be going to the root and protecting young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The Minister of State referred to protecting children, but that is not what he is doing. I can speak with some authority on this matter, as I have been grotesquely misrepresented in this regard. What the Minister of State is discussing is the political reality that if one does anything on the issue of children, one will be subjected to intense scrutiny and one's motives will be misinterpreted, particularly where the children are young. People will misinterpret what is stated and talk about parental rights, the family and this, that and the other. The entire area of children is a minefield. For this reason, it is necessary that the House have Independents who are not so subject to the whims of political and public opinion and the kind of nonsense that is stirred up by certain elements in the media. It is not a question of sensitivity to children or of protecting their rights. It is actually a question of protecting the political base. People will not get involved because there may be misinterpretation. This is my view of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> This is an important matter, as the people who are the subject of the Bill are at their most vulnerable. They will not be protected by this legislation. I hope the Minister of State will take a further opportunity to reflect on the matter calmly and to determine whether, in light of the arguments and the substantial volume of legal precedent that has been put on the record by Senator van Turnhout and others, it is possible for the Government to move in a more radical fashion. The Minister of State would generally have the support of the House. I have heard no one on the Government side speak effectively against this proposal. Indeed, Senator Keane has indicated that, in her experience and from her reading of the scientific material, gender identification generally takes place at an extraordinarily early age - from three to five years old. That is obvious. Was it something that the public did not know? We should be in advance of the public, not led by it. In legislation such as this, we should be leading and informing public opinion. I doubt whether the people of middle Ireland are glued to their computers, assuming this is even going out on computer. I very much doubt it. Maybe the people are glued. In some small way, this debate will contribute to their education.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> It would create a good headline if the Minister of State were to give an indication that he would at least consider this matter in future. We in Seanad Éireann understand the political difficulties of anything dealing with the welfare and rights of children, particularly when there is any suggestion of sexual identity, sexuality or so on. The entire Chamber would support the Minister of State were he to give an undertaking to consider this issue ahead of Report Stage. He could then tell us that he had decided against it and we would argue it again. I appeal to him not to close his mind. This is a new and radical area, but the Seanad is a place where it is appropriate to be radical.</p>

I am disappointed, as I was co-operative in how I tried to put forward my position and explain what we are trying to do on an evidence basis as well as a human one. That is part of our job. The Minister of State is right in that we can consider other laws, but some of those were drafted a long time ago. Malta is going much further.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I would love that we were passing the law that is being passed in Malta today, which is centred around the lived lives of transgender people. They were brought into the centre of this matter. I am not asking for that and instead am asking for something more conservative than Malta. I ask that we ensure we have a process, especially where everybody is in agreement or where the best interests of the child are fundamental.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> I understand what the Minister of State said about looking at other jurisdictions and other laws. I ask him to look at what the Irish people voted for in November 2012.

Leading up to the referendum I felt at last we were no longer saying to children to sit and wait in the corner, as it were, because we were going to deal with the adult stuff first, sort our lives out first and make children wait. We were dealing with these problems whether it was looking at adoption law, information and tracing, the mother and baby homes or historical abuse.</p>

Bord Uchtála? We are saying that we as a State are very happy to compound in our law that we will give no opportunity for a child who identifies a gender to go to a school of their choice that their parents agree with and that everybody agrees with. That is not being progressive. It upholds parents' rights and the child's rights but I do not see progression.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Will the Minister of State go back to the drawing board and have a look again to see what we can do?

I do not accept that we are being groundbreaking in any way. I find it regrettable that we cannot even find a way to have a conservative amendment at least to allow a small number of children to live their lives as they wish, and as their families and friends wish them to live.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I find myself in the position where, if forced to, I would support the Bill because there are people sitting here who have waited 20 or more years. This little country of ours inflicted so much pain and suffering on children. Down through the generations we turned a blind eye to everything that went on in this country.

          <p eId="para_427"> The Minister of State indicated, and I believe him, that he will look as hard as he can and as favourably as he can on all of the amendments.

          <p eId="para_428"> This Bill has to pass. Even if it is the flawed version, it has to pass because people have waited 25 years or more for it to pass. If we pass the flawed version and spend years banging through amendment after amendment, what will those children, who will then be 50 years old, say about us? What will they say about our empathy for their situation? What will they say about our understanding of our fellow humans? We have a rare chance to lead the world, to provide legislation that will recognise the needs of our fellow human beings. I ask the Minister of State to take what I have said on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response. I listened very carefully to what he had to say. All of the amendments are designed to put children, their best interests and their rights front and centre. I agree with what Senator Norris said because it is exactly what we are trying to do - deal with the root of this issue. It strikes me as not just odd or bizarre but outrageous and wrong that while moving in the right direction in terms of gender recognition, we will leave out very young children where it is blindingly obvious they are going to have to go through an ordeal, as in the case of the six year old boy Senator van Turnhout spoke about earlier. The Minister of State has not given me any reason he would want to see that child or any child go through that ordeal, even after hearing all of the concerns raised about a negative. It will have an impact on that child's health and well-being. It will have a psychological impact as well as causing bullying and isolation. That child is going to be put through all of these situations because we are not prepared to make the right decision in this Bill, which is appalling. I will continue, as will others, to press this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I appeal to the Minister of State to reflect on what has been said. I hope he will be able to come back on Report Stage. If not, then this is not the groundbreaking Bill and good day that it should be for gender recognition. It is sad that this is one of the more explicit exclusions in the Bill, which I find fundamentally wrong at every single level and goes right to the heart of how we should deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Senator Craughwell is right. Why should a child have to wait until they are 16 years old before having their gender recognised? That is the simple question. That is what is so wrong about this Bill and what is so flawed about it. Why should somebody have to wait until they are 16 years old? Why should a child have to wait and go through all of that trauma?</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> I suggest the Minister of State follows the logic of his position and the logic of what he has done. He rightly looked at the 16 and 17 year olds and put in place a process to create a pathway for them. I have concerns about the pathway but at least a pathway has been put in place. The logic of that position is that the Minister of State would also make that available for people who are under 16 years. It does not make any sense to do it for 16 and 17 year olds but not for the six year old about whom Senator van Turnhout spoke, and all the other children who find themselves in a similar position.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> It is unfortunate, to say the least, that the Minister of State has responded in that way that he has. The legislation deals with vulnerable children. As we have said, it could have a psychological impact on many people. That is why Senators are passionate about it and that is the reason they have made lengthy contributions, because they want to impress upon the Minister of State the importance of the amendment. We have tried to get him, as all of us should, to put himself in the shoes of those children and ask what we would want the State to do. If we were in that position, what would we want the State to do for us? We would want it to do the right thing and provide gender recognition. If I were in their shoes, I would want those children to have their gender recognised in the way that mine is.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">The Minister of State has a responsibility to look at the amendment again. I do not how he can reject it after what he heard from the Government side. I refer to the way Senator Keane spoke and how she expressed her knowledge of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I have discussed this matter. I have been involved with this issue for three or four years and there are people in the Gallery who I have been involved in helping for a number of years. It was Bertie Ahern who asked me to get involved in this issue about three years ago. I discussed this issue with my husband about three weeks ago and he was taken aback. He is up to date on matters but he was quite shocked at what he was hearing and wondered if this was an issue of importance to many people. He was taken aback if the Minister of State knows what I mean by that. I am not taking from him as a person or his intelligence but I had to explain the seriousness of this issue. It is not on the public radar and our duty as legislators is to bring forward issues and legislation that will help to improve the lives of people in our society. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> I wish to speak about this from my personal experience when my sister was training to be a midwife in a maternity hospital in this city some years ago.

          <p eId="para_438">I ask that he would not read through his papers. I will repeat what I said. I am not being rude and the Minister of State knows that I am very fond of him but I want him to listen to this. My sister was part of a team that delivered a baby in the largest maternity hospital in this city and following it she came to my house totally devastated that a baby had been delivered whose sex was not clearly defined. That baby and its parents were sent home to the west without the matter being raised with the parents. I will never forget that night when my sister came to me and told me. She was very upset that the hospital sent them home without raising the matter with them. I do not know what the hospitals do now when a situation like that arises. I will never forget that night and it is indelibly printed on my mind. I often think of that child and how it got on in life. As Senator Craughwell said, it is hard enough in life when one knows who one is and what one is. If it is not clearly defined physically who one is when one is born, I cannot bear to think about how the child's life would be. I plead with the Minister of State on behalf of all the people here to consider this issue. It is interesting that it is mostly women who are speaking on this issue. It is fascinating.</p>

          <p eId="para_445"> I plead with the Minister of State with regard to this issue. It is not a populist one. People are not out on the streets shouting and roaring that they want all this change to happen, but we have to educate the public about this issue in that there are people who have a problem because they are not happy in the gender they were born in. The Minister of State cannot say that he will not come back to this issue on Report Stage. He has a moral responsibility to listen to us. That is all I have to say about it. We need to have a national conversation about this issue as well to inform the people of Ireland because they are not aware of it. There is no doubt about that because my husband was not aware of it and he does not miss much. I ask the Minister of State to withdraw his comment that he would not come back to it on Report Stage. He has a responsibility in this respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I was also very disappointed by the Minister of State's response. I am also disappointed that we get the impression that there is unlikely to be any movement on the key issues we have identified - those of the age criteria, the medical criteria and the forced divorce requirement - where Members have issues with the Bill. That is unfortunate because on this Stage and on Second Stage voices on all sides of the House said that this Bill does not go far enough. That is not only the view of Opposition Senators like myself but the view of Senators on the Government side. That is such a shame. The Minister of State has said he hears us but we are not getting anything from him in this respect. That is a shame.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> I asked the Minister of State to outline why he is not satisfied for somebody under the age of 16 - be that aged ten, 14 or 15 - to use the incredibly onerous process that is set out, where a person under the age of 16 would not only have to be prepared to make a determination on having their preferred gender recognised but would also need parental consent and a court order. He is saying he does not trust the young person. He is also saying that he does not trust the parent or our courts which make sense of decisions in regard to children and their welfare on a daily basis. I am often in situations where there is much more conflict, where the parent is arguing one thing and the court is being asked to take a different point of view. In this case, the parent would be in agreement and the court is being given the opportunity to validate that, to accept the consent of the parent who is the person who is most familiar with the young person apart from the young person themselves. All the Minister of State is saying is that he cannot move on this but that seems to be more down to political unwillingness rather than to any reason as to why we are wrong on this. </p>
          <p eId="para_448"> As has been pointed out, other countries initially started with such a conservative approach but they are rethinking that. We should not be looking at what other countries did ten or 15 years ago; we should be considering what is best practice in 2015 and best practice in terms of genuinely caring about the best interests of children, and Senator van Turnhout referred to our children's rights referendum. Against the backdrop of all the mistakes we made in the past where we did not listen to or believe children and did not accept they were capable of making decisions based on their own age and maturity and simply dismissed them as being incapable, the point of that referendum was to change that and to say that from here on in as a society we want to make sure that the best interests of children are placed front and centre stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The legislation the Minister of State has brought forward means that even where it is manifestly in the best of interests of a young person to be able to get their true gender recognised, where not only they believe but their parents and the courts believe that, he is still not prepared to provide for it. That is incredibly unreasonable and unfair. Unfortunately, I do not get the sense that there will be any movement on this. I have one amendment tabled regarding people aged over 16 and I sense that he is not prepared to move on that. We will push that amendment to a vote today because I do not believe we will get a different answer from the Minister on Report Stage. I will support the amendment regarding the under the age of 16 if it is pushed to a vote today. I would prefer a system for those aged over 16 where they would not need parental consent and a separate system for those aged under 16 where they would need it. We will table a Report Stage amendment to deal with that, namely, that for those aged under 16, the process that applies in the Bill currently for 16 and 17 years old would apply. We will press the amendment today providing that those aged 16 and 17 should be treated as adults.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">Perhaps if I had been more in tune with public opinion, I might have been elected to the House at a much earlier stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Several Senators made the point about listening and reviewing. I would not come into this House if I was not prepared to listen and take into consideration what is being said, but I have a sense of honesty within myself that I should give a clear indication of where my thoughts are on this. With every motion and every contribution made in the House, I take on board the comments, review the matter and go over the advice I have been given. Members have said that they want to press amendments to a vote on Report State and I wanted to be fair to them and state exactly what my thinking is on this. That is why I said very clearly that I did not propose to accept the amendments. Fianna Fáil has taken note of that and that is the reason it will press the amendment to a vote this evening and I can understand that. It is important that a give a clear indication in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">However, I will reflect on it after the debate. I will read the debate in the Official Report because some of the contributions were very detailed and I want to reconsider them. I want to give this House the respect it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I was listening to Senator White. I hope the practice she mentioned does not continue in major maternity hospitals, but sometimes it is difficult to determine the sex of a child. Unfortunately, sometimes parents do leave the hospital, but there is a mechanism in the registration process to correct that. It is deeply upsetting for the parents not to have a clear understanding as they leave the hospital. I would not like to be a parent going through that experience and I can understand why the Senator's sister was so upset when she came back from work. I believe we have moved on from that. I hope such experiences are in the past and that there are procedures and mechanisms in maternity hospitals to deal with parents in a sensitive manner on the rare occasion when this happens, and that they get good advice. The Senator can rest assured that I was listening while looking through the papers.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> A number of points were made on education, but I will deal with that later when responding to a specific amendment on bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The minimum age has been considered in other jurisdictions. Denmark recently revised its procedures and retained the minimum age of 18. I do not want to say that the Government does not want to move on this or that it is not listening. Pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills now takes place and Committee Stage is a long process which allows further consideration. I was not a Minister of State when Committee Stages of Bills were being taken, but it is interesting to read the Official Report of those Stages and see changes and moves in regard to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I am not sure that what the Senator is proposing is the right thing to do, but to be fair to her, I am giving a clear indication that I will reflect on her contribution. However, at this stage I do not propose to accept the amendments. I know Senator Power wants to move her amendment, so I will conclude.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I am sorry I had to leave to attend a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but I listened carefully to the debate before and after I left. Some substantive and eloquent points were made, as the Minister has acknowledged, and moving experiences recounted. This is an area that is moving. I re-read the joint committee report, the pre-legislative stage, which was just in January of last year. It recommended measures to address the concerns of transgender persons under 16 and looked at guidelines supporting inclusion of transgender young people in schools. It did not go beyond that in terms of the age of 16, but I know there had been a movement before that because originally the minimum age was 18, so I very much welcome that we did move below that to 16.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I read the report of the Ombudsman for Children of October 2013, which again recommended going below 18, and I am glad we followed that. It also recommended that 16 or 17 year olds should be able to apply without parental consent, but as far as I am aware it did not go below that. We need to examine the measures in section 11 to see if the procedures for 16 and 17 year olds are unduly cumbersome.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> There are some positive moves. Subsection (6) requires the court to consider the best interests of the child. I agree with Senator van Turnhout that it is important that this be spelled out, and it is in section 11. Nor does section 11 require parental consent as an absolute, because there is a mechanism for a child who is 16 or 17 to go to the court to get an order dispensing with consent, but we need to consider whether it is still unduly cumbersome for the 16 or 17 year old. If we leave 16 as a minimum age, what measures are being put in place for those below the age of 16 if we are not going to allow for an exemption application to court? Are there other ways to support young people, particularly in the sort of examples we have spoken about in schools and so on? Should there be a legislative provision requiring schools to take account of a child's preferred gender even where there is no formal gender recognition? That is the kind of issue the debate has moved forward on, having come a distance already, which should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I am glad the Minister will reflect on these issues. Today's debate, and even the contributions this afternoon, have raised a number of considerations for all of us.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_468">In page 5, line 25, to delete “Circuit” and substitute “District”.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">This is a fairly simple amendment and may be less important than some of the more substantial amendments we will be dealing with. This is to advise the Minister that the Circuit Court should not have to deal with all of these cases and that the District Court, which is a more local court, might be a better forum in which to deal with them. The rationale is that the District Court has responsibility for hearing minor criminal matters, small civil claims, liquor licensing and certain family law applications. We are of the view that the District Court is sufficient for those family law hearings, and if it is, it is also sufficient for the provisions of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Under the current provisions, an applicant would have to appeal any decision of the Circuit Court to the High Court. We would appreciate it if the Minister could revisit this, because there is a cost involved in appealing an issue to the High Court.

          <p eId="para_476"> With regard to the hearing of appeals from applicants for gender recognition certificates and the exemption of processes for 16 and 17 year olds, the level of the Circuit Court is appropriate due to the importance of these issues.

          <from>Senator Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_480">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_481">In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_482">“ “general medical practitioner” means a medical practitioner who is registered in the Specialist Division of the register of medical practitioners under the medical speciality of “General Practice” or in the General Division of the register of medical practitioners;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I will speak to amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, and will leave other Senators to comment on the others. These amendments all relate to the effort to amend the Bill to include a general medical practitioner in the definition of the primary treating medical practitioner. Before I make a few arguments in that regard, because I have spoken about this previously, I want to say that this is not the ideal situation. Under international best practice and some of the best models of law, no form of medical certification is required to accompany a trans person's solemn and statutory declaration that they seek to live in their preferred gender identity. This is not a top-of-the-class type of amendment. It is a conservative amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">If a medical certificate is required to accompany a transperson's statement of intention, at the very least we should include a general medical practitioner as part of the definition of the primary treating practitioner. As the Minister of State knows, the Bill as currently formulated requires an endocrinologist or psychiatrist to certify that an applicant is transitioning or has transitioned to the applicant's preferred gender. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"> In Ireland the range of medical practitioners who may provide such certification is limited to a small number of specialists. This will lead to significant delays in obtaining appropriate certification. It will prove even more difficult for people who have undergone transition several years ago or abroad. Most transpersons I have spoken with do not have a regular treating endocrinologist or psychiatrist. These amendments would allow a person's GP to certify him or her as having met the requirements contained in sections 9 and 11 of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Where an applicant has a regular general practitioner, the GP will likely be more familiar with the applicant's current circumstances and situation, and will be well placed to provide the relevant certification for the applicant. The fact that the definition of the primary treating physician does not include a GP, is at odds with the HSE's view. The HSE has also put forward the view that a GP should be included in this definition, and that the language of the Bill without that is incongruent with current health practice. That is because a person's primary treating medical physician is almost always a GP. </p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The current emphasis on medical evaluation clearly suggests diagnosis, medical evidence and medical proof, and is restricted to the applicant. The HSE has also argued that if this legislation - concerning just the primary treating medical physician - draws solely on endocrinology and psychology, it will place excessive pressure on specialised and limited resources as the number of clinicians and health professionals with the relevant expertise in this jurisdiction is very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The HSE estimates that approximately 1,000 people will at some time, on the introduction of the legislation, seek a gender recognition certificate which will place unmanageable pressures on already scarce resources. That is the view of the HSE, in addition to my own view.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Hopefully, transpersons will be allowed to go to their GP. However, amendment No. 6, which is quite lengthy, is to ensure that the process for recognition is not made dependent on the applicant undergoing surgical, medical or psychiatric treatment, or an evaluation on physical or psychiatric grounds. The measure is simply to emphasise what the Minister of State has already confirmed, namely, that the applicant will not be required to undergo, or have undergone, any surgical or medical treatment, including hormonal or psychiatric treatment, as a precondition to gender recognition. </p>
          <p eId="para_490"> This amendment is simply codifying the ministerial promise. There is no legal guidance for medical professionals in filling out their form. If this kind of amendment, or a version of it, is not accepted I think that room will exist within the law for the medical person possibly to negate the human right to privacy and self-determination of the transperson, which should be at the heart of our legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#AverilPower" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Senator Averil Power<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_491">If indeed there is going to be a requirement for medical evaluation, then I would support the amendments tabled by Senator Zappone that it should include the GP as the person who has the most regular contact with a young person. From a young person's viewpoint, it will also be a much more supportive environment if the GP is somebody with whom he or she has had a professional relationship over an extended period, rather than seeing a stranger who is a specialist.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> However, as I said on Second Stage, I strongly object to including a medical evaluation. In other jurisdictions, the transgender person is simply required to make a self-declaration. That is currently the case in Argentina and Denmark, while Malta is currently going towards self-declaration also. Requiring a medical diagnosis at all is, unfortunately and uncomfortably, similar to how we treated homosexual people in this country for a long time when homosexuality was treated as an illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> We can argue what is, or is not, involved in requiring transgender people to go through a medical process. It is not clear from the words "medical" and "examination" what exactly that will entail and how intrusive the process will be before one can get somebody to sign the appropriate papers. It is unnecessarily stigmatising, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> The process that is already provided for is restrictive and impractical because it only includes a small number of professionals, rather than general practitioners. I also think it is unnecessary. We have therefore tabled an amendment that gets rid of the medical evaluation altogether and ensures that we will trust people's own judgment instead. Transgender people themselves know better than anybody else what their preferred gender is and who they really are. We should listen to them and trust them instead of adopting a patronising approach, asking "Are you sure?", that seems to be consistent throughout this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Self-declaration should be sufficient and, if not, I would agree with at least changing the medical criteria and professionals involved to make the process as supportive as one can within the current framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">I have tabled a simple amendment because I do not see any logical reason for including this provision. I want to delete the term "based on a medical evaluation of the applicant". By including such a provision we are inferring that transgender people are ill. They are not ill, far from it. They know exactly what they want. By including a psychiatrist, are we inferring that they have mental health issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_503">It is instructive that we have such a distinguished Member of the Government side speaking on this issue. I noted in my speech on Second Stage that there was no definition of "medical evaluation", which I thought would have been crucial for the correct operation of this Bill. I did not put one down because I do not approve of it at all. It seems to me that this is part of the "pathologisation" of the transgender situation. No less a person than the chair of TENI - the Transgender Equality Network Ireland - has said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_504">The requirement to provide a medical evaluation is diagnosis by any other name. The individuals who must sign off on the legislation are the very same individuals who provided diagnosis or medical treatment. This is restrictive and unnecessary. Transpersons are best placed to understand and identify their own gender, as they live it every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Everybody has been saying this for the last two hours, so I do not think there is anything really that remarkable or startling about it. Whether or not there is for the Irish public, generally speaking, in this Chamber we have accommodated ourselves to the idea. We are comfortable with it and understand the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The whole idea of pathologisation involves linking gender identity to mental health. That is quite clear in the language contained in the legislation because it is conditional on a finding that somebody suffers from gender dysphoria. The words "dysphoria" and "dysfunction" suggest illness or a gender identity disorder. We are talking about requiring a medical diagnosis of a disorder or a pathology.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">We have spoken a number of times this evening on the increasing pace of developments in this area. Six months ago on 1 September last year, Denmark's amended gender identity recognition procedures came into force. Under the gender recognition procedure, applicants simply complete an administrative process and supporting medical evidence is no longer required. In Malta, the Minister for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties introduced a new gender identity Bill on 29 October 2014. Under section 3(4) of the Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act, applicants for recognition, "shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." That could not possibly be clearer. There is no requirement for medical evaluation either of a psychiatric or of a surgical nature. That is the way we should go.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I do not see any arguments have been raised against this. In addition, as far back as 2006, nine years ago, but in terms of the rapid progress in this area it is a long time ago because time, as Einstein thought, is relative, a group of internationally recognised human rights experts, including our own former President, Mary Robinson, once or perhaps twice a member of the Labour Party, and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commissioner among other produced the Yogyakarta Principles. Under principle 3 it states that countries should fully respect and legally recognise each person's self-defined gender identity, there is no talk of medical procedures, and ensure that procedures exist whereby, "all State-issued identity papers which indicate a person’s gender/sex — including birth certificates, passports, electoral records and other documents — reflect the person’s profound self-defined gender identity". I will just refer to the words of Dr. Philip Crowley, the national director of quality and patient safety in the HSE, which were quoted by a number of Members on Second Stage because he states the same thing, namely, that people should self-define in this area of gender identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> For all those reasons, I urge the Minister of State to take on board the substance of these amendments. There is a large number of amendments from which he can chose and modify before Report Stage. I will deal with the notion of medical diagnosis. As a gay man, I have been through this notion of medical diagnosis. In the beginning homosexuality was not spoken about at all. In the past it was a crime, then an illness and we have gone through the whole shebang but now it is recognised as part of the rich spectrum of human life. I think it is the same with gender identity. To pathologise it and make it dependent on a medical evaluation, clearly suggests it is an illness-----</p>

There was a stage when many people thought these people were, in the immortal words of former councillor Ned Brennan, "funny bunnies". We do not think that any longer. They are part of the spectrum of life and have exactly the same rights as everybody else.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">This group of amendments is all about the undue medicalisation and pathologising of transgender persons, which we were critical of on Second Stage and today. As others have done, I urge the Minister of State to accept the spirit in which these amendments were moved.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I wish to speak on amendment No. 13, tabled by my colleague, Senator Marie Moloney, which I fully support. To delete the words "based on a medical evaluation of the applicant" would tackle one of the most criticised aspects of the requirements of the procedures in section 9. If the Minister of State is minded to accept this amendment, he would also have to similarly amend sections 11 and 14 and delete line 14 on page 11, line 32 on page 11 and a phrase in lines 23 to 24 of page 15. There would be a number of consequent amendments where the phrase "based on a medical evaluation of the applicant" is used in other provisions in respect of sections 9, 11 and 14.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The key point of this amendment is to remove any suggestion that there would be a requirement that somebody would prove any of the points made by Senator Zappone in her amendment No. 6 to section 7. She states that people should not be required to provide evidence or proof of surgical procedures, etc. I think the spectre of that requirement is raised by the use of the phrase "medical evaluation". In my view that is something we should be looking to change.</p>

That was emphasised by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, when she was in this Chamber. The Department of Social Protection will use a standardised form for completion by the primary treatment physician, asking him or her to confirm that the person is transitioning or has transitioned and fully understands that the person will live in his or her preferred gender for the rest of his or her life.</p>

I have been clear that the supporting statement will not require any information about the person's medical history or care pathway. I have discussed this with the Tánaiste who wants to ensure there will be no confusion on this point. She has raised it with her colleagues in Cabinet today. I am happy to say the Government will be tabling amendments on Report Stage along the lines put forward by Senator Moloney and others. My officials will be working with Parliamentary Counsel immediately to delete the phrase from section 9(1)(g)(ii).</p>
          <p eId="para_525">As a consequence, amendments will be required on Report Stage. Several other consequential amendments will also be examined and I will revert to the House on Report Stage. </p>

          <p eId="para_531">I am delighted to move the Second Stage in Seanad Éireann of the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Bill 2014. At the outset I wish to acknowledge the all-party support that this Bill received in the other House, which has concluded its deliberations on the legislation. I look forward to the debate on the Bill in this House and hopefully the speedy enactment of what is important legislation in the context of future investment and jobs in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The funds industry is a significant provider of high-quality jobs in Ireland, not just in Dublin, but across the country in places like Cork, Limerick and Dundalk, to name but three. The Irish funds industry has surpassed €2 trillion in total assets under administration. It is important that we do not stay still because this is an ever-changing industry. We need to build on that success to bring in more jobs and investment. The purpose of this Bill is to meet the commitment in the IFSC strategy to introduce a new framework for a corporate fund structure which is not a company in order to enhance Ireland's competitiveness as a funds jurisdiction. The new structure will not be subject to many of the requirements imposed on trading companies generally and so will be attractive to fund managers. Many of our competitor countries in Europe already have such vehicles and we must ensure that Ireland keeps pace with them. </p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Our intention is to provide a framework which will assist the Irish funds industry in reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. The proposed structure has a number of advantages for both fund managers and investors, including the simplification and streamlining of the requirements that Irish funds are currently subject to under company law while maintaining an appropriate level of regulatory oversight. It is similar to those mechanisms already in place in Luxembourg, France and the United Kingdom. It will be known as the Irish collective asset-management vehicle, or ICAV. The ICAV is a legal structure for the holding of investment schemes. The investment schemes are subject to a separate, unchanged body of rules for their prudential regulation. The main advantage is that the ICAV structure has been specifically designed to be distinguishable from a typical trading company. Most Irish funds are authorised as investment companies and, as such, are required to comply with many of the rules applicable to public companies which may not relevant or appropriate in the funds context. However, the ICAV is a bespoke corporate structure that will avoid the need for unnecessary compliance with certain company law requirements. This will result in reduced administrative obligations and associated costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Among other advantages, the ICAV differs from company structures in several important ways. First, an ICAV may, with the tacit agreement of the members and the auditor, dispense with annual general meetings, AGMs. This will result in administrative savings without a significant lessening in accountability for the board. AGMs simply are not as relevant in the context of an investment undertaking. Regulated collective investment schemes keep the investors far more up to date with the success or otherwise of the enterprise through daily net asset valuations and they are assured that the investment policies and corporate governance of the scheme are subject to the independent control of third party depositaries who are also closely regulated by the Central Bank. A great many investment schemes already operate as investment limited partnerships, unit trusts or common contractual funds without any requirement for general meetings. Of course, should the directors feel that an AGM is warranted for any reason they are free to call one. Second, ICAVs may make changes in their instruments of incorporation without shareholder consent if the depositary confirms that the interests of shareholders are not prejudiced. This reflects the process that already applies in the case of collective investment schemes constituted as unit trusts. Third, the Company Law Directives will not automatically apply to ICAVs and fourth, the ICAV should also be more practical from a US investor point of view in that it may be treated as a transparent entity for US tax purposes. I must stress that this does not have anything to do with tax avoidance; rather it will allow US investors bring forward their liability and avoid penalties and interest which could accrue in the case. Ireland's early agreement with the US to co-operate with its tax authorities on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, is relevant here too.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The creation of an ICAV involves two stages, namely, registration and authorisation. The registration stage involves the Central Bank entering into a register of ICAVs the fledgling entity. At this stage an ICAV can do nothing but that which is necessary to apply for authorisation as a collective investment scheme. The latter stage involves approval for the ICAV under the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, regulations or approval of the ICAV as an alternative investment fund, AIF.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> The Central Bank already has exacting rules in place for the authorisation of a collective investment scheme by way of the UCITS regulations. These regulations are based on European rules which govern the establishment, marketing and operation of UCITS schemes. These schemes are primarily suitable for retail investors. Alternatively, an ICAV may be authorised in accordance with the process set out in chapter 2 of Part 2 as an alternative investment fund. Such funds are indirectly the subject of the alternative investment fund managers directive, AIFMD, which, though a managers directive, nevertheless sets the context for the regulation of professional investor funds. While the transposing UCITS regulations contain a discrete authorisation process, it is necessary to provide a similar mechanism for the authorisation of ICAVs that propose to operate as AIFs.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> AIFs permit investment managers to market a regulated fund which can invest in a much broader range of assets and use investment strategies which would not be appropriate in a retail investor environment. In many ways the introduction of AIFMD, which brings to fund promoters a universally recognised brand to market and to investors the security of enhanced regulation of their funds, has driven the development of the ICAV. Ireland is the principal domicile worldwide for AIFs and the European marketing passport afforded by AIFMD only makes Ireland more attractive to alternative investment fund managers. </p>
          <p eId="para_538">However, as I noted earlier, our competitor jurisdictions in Europe already have vehicles similar to the ICAV, and to maintain our competitiveness, we need to match and exceed their product offerings, hence the ICAV.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Part 4 concerns the appointment, removal and conduct of directors and to a large extent mirrors provisions in companies' legislation. These provisions help ensure the integrity of the ICAV and include a prohibition on the making of directors' loans. Directors will be under both the rules that apply to the directors of companies for which sanctions, including restriction or disqualification, apply as well as the Central Bank's rules on fitness and probity. In addition to various criminal sanctions provided for here and in the fund rules, directors will also be liable to the Central Bank's administrative sanctions regime for breaches of prudential rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Much of the rest of the Bill is concerned with the operation and end of life of an ICAV as well as ensuring that the supervisory rules and tools available to the Central Bank as the primary regulator and to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are up to the job and match those which already apply to funds which are incorporated under the Companies Acts. These parts were largely based on the Companies Act 2014 to ensure that where it is appropriate that the same rules would apply to an ICAV as apply to investment companies under the Companies Acts. This is achieved, for the most part, by the cross-application of the relevant provisions of the new Companies Act. That Act, in its final stages, was passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas simultaneously with this Bill and that gave rise to certain difficulties in drafting elements of this Bill. Until we had a settled text in the Act we could not have absolute certainty when cross-applying the provisions that the policies and even the textual references would hold. That in part explains why the ICAV Bill was the subject of substantial amendment on both Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil. These cross-applications are primarily done by providing the reader with instructions as to how to apply the relevant provisions of company law to the ICAV without directly amending company law. The main cross-applications include receivership and winding up of ICAVs, the restriction and disqualification of directors, and the relevant investigations, compliance and enforcement powers of the Central Bank and the ODCE when applying provisions based in the Companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> This not a simple Bill. It is technical, particularly the drafting of the cross-applied provisions, but that does not detract from what we hope to achieve. Our job here is to ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to allow very large sums of money to be placed securely in the hands of investment managers to allow them to make those investments grow and provide for retirements, college funds and savings. In return, we reap jobs and investment for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> It is important, therefore, to remember that we are applying tried and tested models for the operation of the ICAV; that the prudential rules that apply are European in origin and worldwide in reputation; and that the base on which the ICAV structure itself is built is Irish company law and the ICAV model itself has analogues across Europe and the world. With the passage of the Bill, which we are debating on Second Stage this evening, we in Ireland will not just be talking the talk in relation to competitiveness, we will be ensuring that the structures we have in place for investment funds match those of competitors while also ensuring that the safeguards are in place, that what needs to be regulated is regulated but bureaucracy as it applies to traditional companies, which is not relevant to investment funds, is not applied. Significant effort has been made over recent months and years to get the legislation right. I hope that by the passage of the legislation, this country can continue to maintain a reputation as a very competitive jurisdiction in which to place one's investment funds. That can only lead to more jobs and more investment for this country. I commend the ICAV Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisODonovan" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Senator Denis O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to the House. I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, who is our spokesman on finance. I confess that sometimes I am an expert on lots of things and master of none but I will bow to my superior experts such as Senators Barrett and Michael D'Arcy. I will make a brief contribution on behalf of Senator Darragh O'Brien and my party.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Fianna Fáil supports the Bill. Since the IFSC was established in 1987, Ireland has established itself as a significant player on the international financial stage. The creation of an Irish collective asset management vehicle is a move towards further realising the funds industry potential. In other words, it is another step in the right direction. A dilapidated swathe of the quays that scarred the city has been transformed into a thriving hub of global funds. Every day, approximately 13,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in both the IFSC in Dublin and a number of locations throughout the country. Its success has been a major boost to the entire economy, and following the financial storms of the past six years, it offers fresh opportunities for job creation and growth. The creation of the Irish collective asset management vehicle is a move towards further realising this particular industry’s potential. It is great to see it is being developed further. However, that demands renewed commitment by the Government to a strong regulatory framework and focus on the industry. In a fast-moving sector, financial innovation constantly challenges legislators and regulators to respond in order to keep pace. This Bill is a step towards enabling Irish financial services to catch up with their EU competitors with a new investment vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The legislation comes after a period of decline in the financial industry, overseen by the Government and perhaps the tail end of the previous Government. We have slipped from tenth place in the global financial index in 2008 to 70th in last month’s survey. The dramatic drop underlines the need for Ireland to diversify its offerings in a competitive marketplace and to restore our regulatory reputation. If the Government is serious about achieving the aims of its five-year strategy for the international financial services industry in this country, it must raise its game. I presume the proposed legislation is designed for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> The serious drop in our international ranking does not bode well for job creation in the sector. The scale of the industry, with some €2.7 trillion in funds and 13,000 jobs, highlights the importance of underpinning a sustainable industry. The sweep of the five-year strategy has real potential for further expansion but requires serious and consistent commitment by the Government. Taking its eye off the ball, as it has done to date, would be a missed opportunity. There is too much at stake to risk the future of the industry and the broader role it plays in the economy. I am sure many factors have led to the decline, including the financial upheavals, not alone in this country but internationally. It would be very easy to lay the entire blame at the foot of the Government or the previous Government but there are external factors at play which we must be honest and recognise.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> In discussing the creation of a new financial vehicle model, it is important that we deal with the regulatory framework. The financial crisis which, unfortunately, continues to linger over the eurozone has illustrated the need for a strong regulatory system to keep market excesses in check. The fast pace of innovation is not just a competitive challenge for Ireland but also a regulatory one. The harshness of the past six years cannot be forgotten or we risk being thrown back into the market turbulence that wreaked havoc globally.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> The Central Bank is at the heart of efforts to keep abreast of new fund models. That requires a mixture of legal tools and key personnel equipped to implement them. Solid regulation is vital in building a strong reputation for business to grow and to provide consistent, reliable rules to protect consumers. As the industry grows and expands with greater financial rewards available, the importance of attracting and retaining skilled personnel will become even greater. The provision of adequate resources to keep, oversee and maintain the industry is of paramount importance. The systemic risks of mobile capital to the economy demand greater vigilance than was shown before and during the financial crash. Anything less would be to flirt with future disaster. It is important to remember that a strong financial sector is an integral part of the modern economy. Used well, it targets investment where it is best applied to create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. It empowers people to realise the dream of home ownership and plan their retirement with a sense of security. Enabling new models such as the ICAV outlined in the Bill creates new avenues for investment as well as strengthening Ireland’s global position. Combined with solid regulation it is a step towards sustainable recovery for this country. It is vital that we learn from the past to place financial services on a sound footing for the future. In that light, my part in Fianna Fáil is to support the Bill. I wish the Minister well.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">When we deal with such issues, it is important that all sides of the House wear the green jersey. The recent election results and potential upheaval in Greece are of concern to the eurozone and the stability of the Irish economy. I am no expert, but that the euro has weakened considerably versus the dollar in the space of nine or ten months, while good for exports, has risks. Europe is not out of the woods. Ireland will play an important role, but we are a small component of the eurozone and Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I wish the Minister of State and the legislation well. I hope that we will have a stronger financial sector, more jobs and a stronger economy as a result of this vehicle. Senators on all sides of the House want there to be a reduction in unemployment and a return of our well-educated emigrants. We are singing off the same hymn sheet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Senator Michael D'Arcy<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_551">I welcome the Minister of State. I am not sure that there are many experts on the subject matter of this legislation in this or the Lower House. I am certainly not one. It is a complicated area and significant legislation is required in a fast-moving world.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> It is important that I put the €2.85 trillion in context. We used to talk in millions before moving to billions. Now we are talking in trillions. Some €2.85 trillion is greater than the GDP of France and not much less than Germany's GDP, yet that is the quantity of funds being administered in the IFSC. However, the IFSC is in more places than just the Dublin docklands. As some Members are aware, there has been a rationalisation to other areas in the country. This is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The Minister of State referred to a competitive jurisdiction. It is good and important that we be able to compete for our share of expensive employment, that being, the other end of the spectrum from the minimum wage. The people in question are educated, qualified and-or experienced. This raises a point about spending power, something that the country has been lacking of late. However, the pensions industry in this jurisdiction is not competitive. The charges it levies are much higher than in other jurisdictions. If we need to move this legislation so as to get our share of those funds' business, we must ensure that they remain competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I speak as someone who is a part of the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, setup and has staff. The €2.85 trillion covered by this Bill is staggering. Is there any prospect of this legislation facilitating the State being left on the hook by the actions or inaction of individuals administering these funds or a failure by our regulators to stay on top of their administration nationally or internationally? This is an important point. I must be careful in what I say because I am a member of the banking inquiry, as is Senator Barrett. We cannot say anything that is prejudicial. The State cannot be on the hook for quantities that are greater than France's GDP. On the night in question, the bank guarantee, which did not cover non-Irish banks, was €440 billion whereas the entire sector was valued at approximately €600 billion, yet those are fractions of the industry that we are discussing and that is domiciled in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I support this legislation and welcome Senator O'Donovan's statement that Fianna Fáil will do likewise. Recent opportunities have not been lost, as most political parties have pulled on the green jersey and done the right thing to attract employment prospects, especially in high-end employment. As any first year law student would point out, whenever a case querying legislation ends up in court, the legislation's debate by the Oireachtas is considered by the Judiciary. There can be no prospect of the State being on the hook for any portion of these colossal amounts. Most people do not even know that such amounts are traded in Ireland. The net figure is almost €1.4 trillion. I appreciate that the Minister of State might not have the answer today. The Bill passed all Stages in the Lower House without a vote and I do not anticipate a vote in the Seanad, but I would like an answer. This is my major concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> According to the Minister of State's speech, the funds are administered in Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. It is important that jobs in this field be distributed around the country instead of only being found in Dublin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-02-03T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_557">I welcome the Minister of State and assure the House that Senator Michael D'Arcy is a valued member of the banking committee. There should be no false modesty over there. I thank the Minister of State and his Department for the support they have given to the inquiry. I hope that he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, will get something useful in return. I also thank the officials who offered a briefing on this legislation, but we were busy trying to keep Aer Lingus as an independent airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I echo the comments of Senators O'Donovan and Michael D'Arcy. A drop from tenth to 70th requires analysis. We developed a dreadful reputation in financial services. It was the largest banking bust-up relative to GDP anywhere in the world. Some shadowy banks from the IFSC feature in some of the accounts. For example, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, told us that DEPFA Bank had the Germans hopping mad when we needed to do real things in late September 2008. Germany was short €50 billion because of that operation. Another bank that called itself Ormond Quay Funding when it was in Ireland but was SachsenLB cost €15 billion. We want to be sure that there is no question of the Irish taxpayer once again being involved. We have already been badly damaged. The first sign I would erect at the IFSC would read, "Nothing here will be bailed out by the people of Ireland because they can take no more".</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> In many ways, we need stronger regulation but, according to page 2, AGMs need not be held. There was a great deal of sloppy regulation or non-regulation. People called it "light touch", but it was non-supervision. Let us not let people off the hook of AGMs. The instruments of incorporation can be changed without shareholder consent. All of the evidence that has come to the banking inquiry implies that it was this loose-leafed approach that cost the taxpayer dearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Company law directives will not automatically apply to ICAVs. Before Christmas we passed an immense amount of company law, but here we are already saying that it does not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> The Minister says this has nothing to do with tax avoidance. I really hope so, because we have an appalling reputation. Next month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, will report on the Apple issue. Our first response in that case was to deny it and we annoyed no less than President Obama and the Governor of California. We have a bad reputation in that regard. The Irish tax rate is 12.5%. There should be no deductions or allowances and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> In the earlier documents we received, dated October 2014, from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service there are references to taxation. If those have been resolved since then, and the Minister said there were extensive amendments in the Dáil, we will not proceed with those again. The Minister said the Central Bank already has exacting rules in place for the authorisation of a collective investment scheme by way of the UCITS regulations. According to the Honohan report, the Central Bank was AWOL, absent without leave, for a crucial period with regard to regulating the financial sector. I believe it had approximately 15 people doing it. That got us into trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> I am glad there is a prohibition on the making of directors' loans. That was an unsatisfactory feature previously. Very large amounts of money will be placed securely in the hands of investment managers to allow them to make investments grow and provide for retirements and so forth. The last crisis was a property bubble and I commend the Governor of the Central Bank on attempting to stop it happening again, but the evidence coming to Senator Michael D'Arcy and me is that it is even more necessary for commercial property. It is even more bubbly, if one can use that word. Can we learn from Canada, Australia and Singapore, which did not have bank busts and are compliant with Basel III? Why do banks not have more equity? Financial institutions in general must learn from the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I wish to refer to some of the statements in the research paper from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which might be of concern. It states that the Bill sets up a new type of investment company with reduced, but not non-existent, compliance standards. I hope the reductions will not get us into trouble. The document goes on to state, on page 4, that it has highlighted several areas where the legal, regulatory, tax and operating environment may be improved. I hope that was not leading to fewer controls and more tax avoidance. That is a feature we do not need. It also states on page 7: "The ICAV will not be required to be incorporated as a public limited company ..... and therefore will not be subject to the full rigours of the Companies Acts...". It continues: "..... that the ICAV .... be treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for US federal tax purposes and therefore will facilitate investment by US taxable investors and/or US taxable and tax-exempt investors in a master feeder fund structure." I am worried about that. The next page of the document states that it will "allow US taxable investors to avoid certain adverse tax consequences that would normally apply to 'passive foreign investment companies'" and that it will avoid the need for compliance with certain Irish company law requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> There is a complaint on page 18 of the document that the EU directive was "excessively constraining and prevented fund managers from fully exploiting their development possibilities". We had to be excessively constraining. This was the greatest financial disaster to hit a country. The numbers in the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, report last week show that disposable income per person has dropped by €2,500 since the financial crisis, from €20,000 to €17,500. Page 19 refers to the role of the Central Bank and states that it "may make regulations for the proper and effective regulation of regulated financial service providers". It did not do so in the past and it must do so now, because we cannot go through all of that again. The document states on page 28 that the Central Bank can refuse to register an ICAV and that it is an offence to provide false or misleading information, which epitomised the crisis Senator Michael D'Arcy and I are investigating.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Page 34 of the briefing document refers to stronger control of auditors. Senator Michael D'Arcy and I would certainly agree with that. It must be strengthened. I do not know what they were doing. Either they were involved, like rugby referees who comment on every move in a match, or they just turned up six months later, signed the books and did not know anything. I suspect it is former. We will have to find out why auditing standards in Ireland were so bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> We can have the problem of financial institutions that are too big to fail, in which case the country bears the burden. I hope anything the Minister said this evening does not give them any credibility or greater credence. I look forward to the next Stage. I thank the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for their co-operation with the inquiry. We must get this right this time because we certainly did not get it right on the previous occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">This legislation is the most complex legislation brought to the House since I became a Member. It is vitally important. It is also vital, as Senator Barrett said, that we get this right and that the safeguards put in place are sufficiently robust to withstand any type of abuse, scrutiny or rigour that might test them in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Some time ago we used to say that with a billion euro here and a billion euro there, we are soon talking about serious money. However, the €2.8 trillion in this case is a remarkable and astonishing figure.

          <p eId="para_571">Senator Michael D'Arcy can. His farming and economic background allow him to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> If one omits the economies of Germany, Italy and France, the sum of €2.8 trillion is equal to the value of all the other economies in the EU. The Irish fund industry is managing a frightening amount of money. When dealing with such a sum it is vital that fund managers operating in this country are given the flexibility that is required to compete in the globalised financial market. Decisions that are made at this time in America will have an impact in Tokyo 12 hours hence and 12 hours later will have an impact on the Dublin Stock Exchange. That is the level of flexibility required to be a real operator or player on the international markets. This legislation provides that flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> It is about reducing costs, which is vital. We regularly complain in this country about the level of red tape faced by all industries and companies. Reform of some of the outmoded practices that have traditionally bound companies to operate in a particular way is probably well overdue. However, I am desperately conscious of what Senator Barrett said about the risk involved here. If it were five or ten years ago and it was claimed that registration authorisation by the Central Bank would solve the problem, we might not be too reassured. However, the new structures that have been put in place and the new regulatory powers given to the Central Bank and the other regulators by this Government go a long way towards addressing a number of those fears.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I referred to the complexity of the Bill. It will be teased out in greater detail on Committee Stage, when there will be far more scrutiny. I look forward to doing that. I do not have any more to say at this point but I look forward to going through the Bill in detail with the Minister and my colleagues on that Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">I will be brief. Much of the content has been covered this evening and during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. My party will support this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> In the course of the debate in this House and in the Dáil we heard a great deal of praise for a certain industry, with which many people might not be familiar. It is an industry that has a great deal of influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">In the first instance, I am not aware of any other Bill which has come about as a result of the efforts of a single industry and which has not been mentioned in any real way in the programme for Government and which may be seen to have leapfrogged many other pressing issues. I would muse, "Why this Bill and why now?" Many of the answers lie with the IFSC Clearing House Group. This hugely influential body put the issue on the agenda in this House. In fairness, many community groups would love to hold such influence. However, as the Minister of State stated and as other Senators alluded to this evening, the industry is a major player in Ireland, employing over 10,000 people. We have heard figures in the trillions in terms of how much is being managed by it, making it a significant economic player and one which warrants significant attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> In some ways, there are facets to the Bill which could be seen as a lightening of regulation. Senator Barrett mentioned some concerns he has in terms of the legislation. To be fair to the Minister of State, I know he has listened to my colleague in the other House, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and addressed some of his concerns. The sustainability of an approach which allows American companies to invest on a "check the box" basis has been questioned. The idea that Ireland could compete with Luxembourg is very risky given it is a micro-state built on finance and this is not particularly suitable for the Irish economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I do not intend to labour these points. Many of them have already been dealt with in the other House. I have expressed my concerns and I know the Minister of State has addressed many of them with my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty. I look forward to the rest of the debate in this House. </p>

I wish to acknowledge, as I did at the outset, the cross-party support which has been received for this Bill in both the other House and, it seems, this House. I am very grateful for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I echo Senator O'Donovan's comments. This is an Ireland Inc. issue. No one party, Government or series of Governments can claim credit for the international financial services, IFS, strategy. It is a strategy which has been correctly pursued by many. I also think it is sometimes unfair for IFS to be muddied with some of the domestic banking issues. This is perhaps a debate for another day. However, the Government in the 1980s which thought of the idea of developing Ireland as a hub for IFS and, as alluded to by Senator O'Donovan, creating the IFSC to regenerate an area and create employment at Dublin's docklands, certainly succeeded in this ambition and much more. </p>
          <p eId="para_582"> In 1987, there were three companies operating in international financial services in Ireland employing 55 people. By the end of 2014, there were over 200 companies and 35,000 people employed in international financial services. A crucial point, on which Senator Michael D'Arcy touched with regard to regional development, is that over 10,000 of the 35,000 jobs were outside Dublin. The question we now have as a Government, a country and an Oireachtas is where we go next with international financial services. </p>
          <p eId="para_583"> When the Taoiseach appointed me as Minister of State with responsibility for international banking and the IFSC in July, I set about doing a number of things to co-ordinate Ireland Inc.'s effort in terms of marketing and branding the country as a location for IFS. It is not all about tax. It is about our skilled workforce, the ease at which people can do business and the fact that we are the only English-speaking country in the eurozone. I am currently devising a new strategy for the international financial services sector which will go to Cabinet at the end of February, be launched at the start of March and be promoted as part of the St. Patrick's Day trade missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> For the first time, we now have the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sitting around the table on a fortnightly basis, chaired by me and presumably my successors in future Governments, saying where we are going with IFS. This is really important. </p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I wish to respond to a number of issues raised during the debate. The regulation of funds was mentioned by Senator O'Donovan. This Bill concerns the creation, establishment, operation and possible end-of-life rules for the vehicles which house the funds. The Central Bank will continue to regulate these funds under the UCITS rules or the rules applying to alternative investments funds, AIF, under the AIF rule book or the AIF managers EU regulations. </p>
          <p eId="para_586"> There was a broader point in the debate with which we need to be careful. We are not creating new risk. The risk already exists. There is already the level of funds, about which Senator D'Arcy and Senator Gilroy spoke, in this country being domiciled through this country and which is of great benefit to this country. The issue is how we regulate them. I would contend, very strongly, that it is important in a regulatory system to have credible regulation. Credible, robust regulation needs to ensure appropriate regulation is being thrown at a fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> There is no point pretending an investment fund is the same as a traditional company when it simply is not. Our competitors do not do this. I know Senator Reilly had to leave, but we are not just speaking about Luxembourg. We are speaking about our neighbours in the UK, France and many other European countries. This is not about lessening regulation. This is about how we treat an investment fund. Should we treat it as a company when it clearly is not the same as a traditional company? I am sure we will tease this out on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> A lot of what this Bill is about and a lot of what has taken up my officials' time has been cross-applying the Companies Act and ensuring that every single part of the Companies Act which is relevant to an investment fund is applied and that which is not relevant is not applied, ensuring that where the Companies Registration Office has not got a role that the Central bank has a role and checking, when it comes to sanctions, that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the Central Bank has a role. We have put a lot of time and effort into ensuring this Bill is as robust as possible, including having a very productive debate in the other House. </p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Senator Reilly asked from where did this come. It very clearly came from the IFSC strategy. I feel very strongly when people say they have problems with Bills coming from certain aspects of industry. If I was the Minister for agriculture and had met with a load of farmers and farmers said this is what needs to done to help revitalise agriculture, I am quite sure Members on all sides of the House and I myself would say it is right and proper that the Minister for agriculture would listen to the farming community. I similarly think it is right and proper for me, as Minister of State for the IFSC, to listen to the IFS community, while remembering, as the Minister for agriculture must with regards farming regulations and safety, the responsibility the Government, these Houses and I have with regard to regulations. I will not stand for and will not answer snide comments about business interacting with Government. Some 35,000 people are employed in the international financial services sector. It is pretty important that any Government of any hue would talk to those people. </p>
          <p eId="para_590"> On the issue regarding Senator D'Arcy's point, echoed by a number of Senators including Senators Barrett and Gilroy, on whether this country would be on the hook - I think this was the phrase used by Senator D'Arcy - I am pleased to clarify that the answer is absolutely not. This is different to traditional banking in the sense that investors are aware that the value of the investments they make can go up and down. It is obviously not the same as a bank deposit in that sense. I will come back to the Senator with a detailed note on it because it is an important question. It is important to note that these are investment funds and there is a warning that the investments are at risk. This is different to banking and financial stability matters. The State is not on the hook for loss of investment. The State has obligations under the investments services directive under EU law. It is important to note this difference also. </p>
          <p eId="para_591"> I am checking if I have answered everyone's questions on this matter. If I have not, I ask that the Senators would come back to me. We will have other opportunities to tease this out at a later stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_592"> On Senator's Barrett point on regulation, we have very new regulatory structures in place. We have seen significant reforms within the Central Bank. We have seen the regulator being subsumed, for want of a better word, into a unified structure within the Central Bank. We have seen significant efforts at European level to beef up regulation, rightly and properly. I, in my role as Minister of State for the IFSC, consider it extremely important to have a business-responsive Central Bank which will engage, consult and provide information, but equally that the State would provide the Central Bank with all the resources and support it needs to implement robust regulation. This is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Senator Barrett referenced the issue of tax. I wish to reiterate this point on the US. The ICAV is a more practical form of investment from a US investor's point of view because it can be treated as what is known as a transparent entity for US tax purposes. This does not have anything to do with tax avoidance, but rather it allows the US investor bring forward his or her liability and avoid penalties and interest which could accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">It is making it easier for investors in the United States to pay their tax liability. I wish to clarify that it is not lessening the tax liability but, rather, it is not allowing penalties to accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> On the question of Ireland's reputation and international tax, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, took a decision in the budget, in light of - as the Senator quite rightly says - our reputation and the three Rs relating to foreign direct investment, two of which are reputation and regime. The base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process raised a number of issues. The Minister decided that, rather than waiting for a process to bring us to an endpoint, we should get out ahead of the issue, to clearly and definitively end the double Irish arrangement while at the same time proudly defending Ireland's corporation tax rate. It is important to note that a number of countries that might raise issues with regard to Ireland's corporation tax rate actually have a lower effective rate. At least the Irish rate is very transparent, and we will be vigorously defending some of the cases to which the Senator alluded. We are also co-operating on the OECD BEPS process and we are participating in an advance implementation group in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> This country favours an international tax system that links substance with tax because, unlike some other countries, we have a lot of substance. The investors I meet who want to come to this country are coming here because of our skilled workforce and our access to the eurozone. I agree that they also come because of our corporation tax offering, but that is only one small piece of a much broader and larger package that we have to offer. </p>
          <p eId="para_597"> On the occasion of my first appearance in this House dealing with Second Stage of a Bill, and as a Minister of State with responsibility for the IFSC, I thank Senators on all sides for their constructive contributions. I look forward to the continued passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas. In doing so I am confident in the belief that this legislation will be another important offering in the toolkit of Ireland Inc. in attracting more jobs and investment into Ireland.</p>
