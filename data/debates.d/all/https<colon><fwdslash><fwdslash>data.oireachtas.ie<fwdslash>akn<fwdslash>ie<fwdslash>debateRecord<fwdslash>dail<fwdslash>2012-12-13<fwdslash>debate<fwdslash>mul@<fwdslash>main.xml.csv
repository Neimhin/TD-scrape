There are two minutes for the first question, three minutes for the reply and one minute for supplementaries. I call Deputy Martin.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	As chairman Keaveney tweeted last night, the die has been cast. Labour and Fine Gael Deputies have voted, one and all, for some of the most regressive cuts to child benefit, respite grants and child clothing allowances, and an increase in tax for low paid workers. This is despite the fact the Labour Party made extraordinary commitments before the last general election. It has now broken every single promise it made. To quote the Tánaiste himself on 11 February 2011, before the election date: "The Labour Party will not agree to having child benefit cut anymore and Fine Gael need to drop their plans to cut child benefit". That is the solemn promise he made to the Irish people. Labour then put posters up all over the country, "Protect child benefit, vote Labour", "Families Need Labour in Government" and "A Cut Too Far – Fine Gael – Every Little Hurts".

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	They then go and take €10 per month in child benefit off the first and second child and €18 off the third and fourth child. When pressed on breaking those promises, the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said the other night: "Isn’t this the kind of thing you tend to do during an election campaign?" - in other words, you tend to make these kinds of promises. This basically means Labour never had any intention of keeping these promises in the first place. They knowingly deceived the people of this country. They knowingly betrayed the people of this country. Labour's way was the ultimate deception.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	7	The Tánaiste might not like those words coming from me. To be fair, Senator John Whelan has perhaps put it far more succinctly, when he said he was one of the Labour candidates who put up and delivered those leaflets. He said: "We have broken that promise on child benefit, we misled the public and I have been made a liar of by the budget cuts to child benefit."
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	Thank you, Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	That is what Senator John Whelan wrote in yesterday's The Star newspaper. He continued: "The betrayal of the public's trust just adds salt to wound." He then said in a message to, I think, every Deputy in the House, particularly to his own Deputies: "We know in our hearts and souls it is wrong, morally wrong, inequitable and unfair as these budgetary measures penalise ... low-income families the worst."

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	I want to ask the Tánaiste one very basic question. No one forced him to make those promises and no has forced him to break them. Why is the Fine Gael promise not to increase taxes on people earning over €100,000 more important than the Labour Party promise not to cut child benefit?

He said the Tánaiste had made a liar out of him, and he wrote it in yesterday's The Star newspaper.I asked the Tánaiste a very basic question which he skirted around. I repeat: why was the Fine Gael promise not to increase taxes on people earning more than €100,000 more important than the promises made by the Labour Party? The Tánaiste went out before the election, looked people in the eye and said that his party would not agree to cut child benefit. He then went into government and cynically stood over that cut.

The Tánaiste's party put up those leaflets before the elections deliberately to mislead people, and we know why that was done.

The Tánaiste has accused others of having a hard neck. I suggest that his is a hard neck of the bright, brassy variety. It is clear that "fair" is a four-letter word in the minds of Fine Gael and the Labour Party. I do not know how he can credibly say what he has said to the very people he promised to protect, including children and their parents, carers and people with long-term sickness and disability. I do not know how any Member opposite will look these people in the eye and utter the word "fair". The Government is rushing through social welfare legislation today to introduce cuts which in real terms and in real time will cause real hardship to real families, real children and real women. Here is the real clanger - these are the very sections of society to which the Government promised protection. So much for that. I do not know whether the Tánaiste deliberately set out to make liars of his Ministers, Deputies and Senators and to make a liar of himself, but he has done that comprehensively. So brass iron is his own neck that he will stand up in this Chamber and waffle on about fairness. I do not know how he does it. I suggest to Government Members, especially those in the Labour Party, that perhaps the die is not yet cast. Amendments will be brought forward today to see off the worst excesses of these cuts, particularly in respect of the respite care grant and child benefit. The latter is the matter about which the Tánaiste was so passionate and so right not so long ago. The die may not already be cast. Despite Labour Deputies' brass-necked leader, who has made liars of them, perhaps they will step up to the plate and actually defend those people to whom they made solemn promises.

That is to have brass neck. The budget is a difficult one because it aims to restore the country's finances and get us out of the economic mess we inherited. It protects basic rates of social welfare and children in the classroom - there are no cuts to basic education services. It protects health services and introduces the biggest package of taxes on wealth ever been seen in a budget, certainly in my time in the House, which will raise more than €500 million. The approach the Government is taking to what is a difficult budget is to protect those on low and middle incomes and ask those with the broadest shoulders to bear the most.

Yet again, the Labour Party and Fine Gael will be seen as brazenly targeting children, carers and mothers and making absolutely no apology for it. They had their chance to have a change of heart. Do they know something? They would have had the full backing of the general public if they had had the courage of their convictions. I have said this to the Tánaiste before. It is not merely the case that the people cannot trust the Labour Party in government. The Labour Party cannot trust itself. It jumps at the whim of Fine Gael. Let it address itself to carers, in particular, mothers and children and explain to them why its masterplan for economic recovery relies on causing them hardship.

Everybody in the country understands this and that this is difficult and will not happen overnight. Sinn Féin has a fairy tale that we have to make a €3.5 billion budget adjustment, but it also claims that it can produce fairy tale solutions to the problem. The Deputy mentioned homework. She did not do much on her party's proposals. She did not even have them costed by the Department of Finance.

In view of the fact that the Taoiseach stated yesterday there would be no wave of repossessions, which runs contrary to what was stated in the Financial Times and other global media and about which the Government is so sensitive, why has the decision been made to introduce legislation to allow the banks greater powers of repossession next year?

Why is this? The reason is that people will have the property tax which they are unable to pay deducted at source. I am not talking only about the middle classes and high and middle income earners but also about people on social welfare who will be confronted with a situation where the property tax will be taken from their social welfare payment before they can even put food on the table. Will the Tánaiste tell me why the Revenue Commissioners were selected to do this? Is it because the Government knew and did not care, that people would be unable to pay?

Does the Tánaiste have sympathy with the view that the Revenue Commissioners have been chosen to collect the property tax because this is the only way the money involved can be extracted from people as a result of the fact that they simply cannot afford to pay? Imagine the scene that will obtain when many people on social welfare payments or modest incomes have money deducted from those payments or their salaries. They will be obliged to make sacrifices in respect of necessities such as putting bread on the table, paying fees and heating their homes. I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider what is being done here. There are other ways of collecting this tax. Did the Government collect the household charge through the Revenue Commissioners? The reason it is not collecting the property tax in the same way it collected the household charge is that people cannot pay. The Government's attitude is that it is going to bring in the heavy gang-----

I understand this proposal relates to the Supplementary Estimate for health. We were informed last week that the Government proposes to make, in a full year, over €1 billion in further cuts to the health service. None of what is involved in this regard has been set out in any detail. There is speculation in today's newspapers about cancellation of routine surgeries. We can only read about these matters in the media. It is most unacceptable that a Supplementary Estimate relating to health should be put through on the nod without scrutiny or debate, particularly in circumstances in which the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Government have failed spectacularly to set out exactly how they intend to make the savings that are required.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	180	I agree 100% with Deputy McDonald. We made the point last week that €1 billion worth of Supplementary Estimates have been put through the House with no discussion during plenary session.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	187	The point is that last year's health Estimate contained figures which no one had any intention of ever realising. Those figures related to drug pricing, the income from private health insurance - which has disappeared from this year's budget - and agency nursing, in respect of which a 50% cut was proposed. They were included in last year's health Estimate but nothing was done until August when cuts were made in respect of personal assistant services for people in independent living and savage cuts were introduced in the context of home help hours.Nothing was done until August when there were cuts to the provision for personal assistants, which enables people with disabilities to live independently, and savage cuts to home help hours. These cuts were made because of the fraudulent nature of the health Estimates. That is the reason the Supplementary Estimate is required and there is a need for a debate. I, therefore, ask the Tánaiste to provide the House with an opportunity to have a meaningful debate on the health Estimate, in particular.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	188	I refer to the budget overruns and the extra cuts required as a result a few months ago. They included very significant cuts to home help hours and to the provision for personal assistants for those with disabilities. We do not know the details of further cuts amounting to €780 million due to be made as part of the budget. The Government has put a spin on the fact that extra money is being provided, while covering over the fact that more than €750 million will be taken from the health budget. At the very least, given the great anxiety caused as a result of making the extra cuts amounting to €130 million, we need to scrutinise the Supplementary Estimates in order that we understand the implications they will have in the delivery of health services.

We oppose the proposal as it makes a farce of the House. It is now almost 11.30 a.m., yet the proposal is to ram through and guillotine Committee and Remaining Stages of the Social Welfare Bill by 2.30 p.m. This allows but two and a half hours for meaningful discussion on the cut to the respite care grant, which is having a heavy impact, the cut to child benefit and the removal of the PRSI exemption. With regard to the removal of the PRSI exemption, a person earning €25,000 will be hit by a 36% increase while a person on €175,000 will be hit by a 3% increase. How can that be fair? We will have no chance to discuss that at all. There will be no chance to discuss the cuts to the jobseeker's benefit, lone parent allowance and farm assist payment. The cut to the latter benefit is very serious for many farmers on the farm assist scheme across the country. My point is that all of these measures have not yet been discussed on Committee Stage.

We are looking for a reasonable amount of time to discuss, amendment by amendment, the issues to do with child benefit.

The Tánaiste can play politics and all the games he wants, but the bottom line is that we have until 2 p.m. to debate the Social Welfare Bill. There is no urgency attached to dealing with the Bill. We can deal with it next week. Instead of dealing with the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill, we could use the time allowed to discuss the Social Welfare Bill. It is that simple. The Tánaiste did not respond to that request in his last contribution.There is an opportunity for the Tánaiste to respond in a meaningful and constructive way. Let us move the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill back until next week and deal with the Social Welfare Bill in its place.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	352	The point I was making last night was that while this provision may appear to be technical, it provides the Minister with permission to commence changes to the lone parents regime, including the withdrawal of the lone parent payment when the youngest child reaches a particular age. We were given an assurance last year that this provision would not come into effect until such time as child care arrangements had been put in place. Where a lone parent payment is withdrawn, a parent will have to sign on and make a declaration that he or she is available for full-time employment. The parent will then be asked to take up a place on a Tús or back to education scheme and so on. The difficulty that arises, not for parents but for children, is that in the absence of adequate child care places children will be left to care for themselves. One would expect that where a parent leaves a child on his or her own all day social services would, possibly, take that child into care. Yet, an arm of this State will later this year commence an order which encourages this. I do not disagree with the policy change in terms of providing people with a way back to work. However, I do not believe it is possible to do this without first ensuring there are guaranteed child care places for the children of parents forced to return to work, where those children are below an age at which they can reasonably care for themselves. If the Minister can give that commitment, then it is appropriate to enforce this arrangement. If not, she will be putting parents in impossible situations. Not alone will they lose their lone parent payments but they may lose entitlement to rent assistance. This could become a major issue during the next year. The Minister referred to the ten new offices throughout the country. While I understand these are part of a pilot scheme, ten new offices will not cut it in terms of the number of child care places required. There are almost 450,000 people unemployed. There are not jobs and places on schemes for all of the people at whom this change is aimed. I urge the Minister to postpone this commencement order until after the pilot scheme is up and running, following which a more comprehensive scheme in respect of the provision of child care places for the children of lone parents who are going to be asked to seek full time employment can be put in place.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	353	I would like to put on the record of the House that much of the discussion by the Opposition around the lone parent and carers issues is confusing people. I will explain to Members what a single parent with a special needs child receives from the Department by way of income support, which with a special needs child such parent would, of course, need. A single parent of a special needs child is entitled to €188 per week plus €30 for the child. In addition, he or she receives a half rate carer's allowance. As such, a parent with one child, who is a special needs child, would receive a weekly social welfare payment of €319.80. This is important in the context of the policy debate we are having. The €319.80 payment is made up of a one-parent family payment of €188, a child payment of €29.80 per week and a half rate carer's allowance of €102 per week or €309.50 per month. As I have stated previously, I have protected primary weekly payments. When in government, Fianna Fáil cut the lone parent payment by more than €16 per week. I want to put what is being discussed here in context. A single parent with one child, who is a special needs child, receives-----

A lone parent who is a carer - I know the Deputy is aware of this - is not, as suggested by her, required to seek employment because he or she is, by virtue of being a carer, deemed to be working. In addition to the €319.80 per week payment plus €130 per month by way of child benefit, a lone parent is entitled to the household benefits package and a travel pass. The household benefits package includes a €3 per week television allowance, an estimated €2 per week free travel allowance; a €10 electricity allowance and a telephone allowance of between €5 and €6 per week. In addition, a lone parent who is a carer is entitled to a respite care grant of €1,375 per annum. In international terms - I know the Deputy is aware of this - our lone parent and carer payments are among the highest in Europe. The lone parents with whom I have spoken say that what they would like is more certainty around the availability of respite places and other services for the child for whom they are caring. I want to make it clear that what many of the carers with whom I have spoken want, in terms of reform of the system, is more certainty in relation to respite care places. The package of payments for a carer in receipt exclusively of the carer's allowance is worth €13,350 per annum.If the person being cared for lives with the carer and is an adult, he or she is entitled to disability payments amounting to approximately €11,000 per year. The total package, therefore, for a disabled adult being cared for by a spouse is worth €24,370 per year. Deputy Murphy and I would both like to make that payment higher, but the worst reduction in payments to such people was made by Fianna Fáil when it cut the allowance for a disabled adult being cared for by a spouse by €16 per week over the course of a number of budgets. It also took over €16 per week from carers over the course of a number of budgets. That is the cut that cut the deepest for those families comprising a lone parent caring for a child or an adult caring for a disabled person.

I took a particular category of lone parent - namely, a lone parent looking after a child with a disability - and pointed out, reasonably, that such a person is not, as the Deputy was suggesting, required to go out and find work. The fact that the person is a carer is fully recognised by the staff in every social welfare office of the Department of Social Protection.

The best outlook for such parents and for their children, whom they love and care for so much, will come from our assistance in getting them back into the labour force or into training and education, which will open up a life of opportunity for themselves and their children. We have one of the highest rates of direct payments for parents and children in Europe. These figures are verifiable. Our risk of poverty is reduced by almost 50% more than even the richest of European countries because our level of transfers and payments is so high. I know that Deputy Murphy and many other Deputies would like to increase them.

That is why, for instance, in this budget I am increasing funding for the provision of hot school meals and for the special initiatives for children in disadvantaged areas. Deputy Murphy, to some extent, is not looking at the question of how to ensure we have a strong social welfare system that is not simply strong in terms of income transfers. All of the European statistics show that it is exceptionally strong in that regard and even rich European countries do not, in many cases, have the level of transfers that we have. Instead, what they have is a much more active social welfare system that encourages people back to work. I said already that we have ten offices now operating the new system of social welfare. These are not pilots but are the first wave of the transformation of the Department of Social Protection from being a passive Department that simply pays money to people who unfortunately have lost their jobs or who, for other reasons, are getting a social welfare income, to an active Department that not only pays people an income but also enters into a contract with them - a contract between the individual and the Department on behalf of our citizens and taxpayers - that the Department will give the individual and his or her family their entitlements in the form of income supports but will also oblige the person, particularly as his or her children grow up and attend school, to get back into education and training and back to work. That combination is a win for the family and a win for Irish society and taxpayers. There are approximately 96,000 lone-parent families in Ireland. Think of all of the talent and energy that could be harnessed by my Department by helping those families get back into education and work and back to financial independence. Deputies know that the families and individuals who get back into employment and regain their financial independence are the winners. If one talks to women in their 50s or 60s who have been parenting on their own they will say that getting a good job was the best step they took. If, however, a woman in her twenties or early thirties who is looking after a baby on her own delays taking that step for a long time and delays updating her education, training and qualifications for ten or 20 years, it is quite hard for her to make up the gap in terms of getting a reasonable job and becoming financially independent. I make no apologies for saying that this is a reform-----

The Minister opened the debate this morning by claiming that we are confusing matters. She is confusing matters. This is precisely the issue I addressed last night. Will child care places be made available for all those who are forced onto jobseeker's benefit when their youngest children turn 12 after 3 May 2012? I do not want a response. I merely want to make the point that we discussed this issue last night and this morning. I am not going to continue speaking because I do not want to wind down the clock but if the Minister is serious about this she will not commence it until there is a space for every child who requires one. There is no point in making a space for a parent on a job activation scheme unless there is also a child care place for the child.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	441	I have engaged in intensive work with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs over the past year so that the State could provide additional child care places. This is why I was happy to announce an additional 6,000 after-school places. Ireland is starting from a low base in regard to child care. All of us recognise that our child benefits and lone parent payments are among the highest in Europe. However, in most other countries in Europe, including 90 miles to the north, lone parents do not retain that status exclusively once their children attend school. This is to give the parents the opportunity to get involved in education, training and community work, which will assist them and their families to become financially independent. The best social welfare systems provide income support, particularly when the children have not yet started school full-time, while also giving tremendous support to help people return to education, training and, ultimately, employment and financial independence. That is the purpose of the changes to the lone parent payments. These changes have been welcomed. Last night Deputy Ó Snodaigh, like most of the other Deputies who spoke in the debate, welcomed the extension of time and the additional child care places. I think this is an important initiative and I hope the House will support it as a progressive development which will open new horizons for people who are parenting alone. Even though we have been discussing painful reductions in this budget, our lone parent and childhood supports are among the highest in Europe. Successive Governments have devoted 37% of their budgets to social welfare. That has resulted in a reduction of the at risk of poverty rate of 60%, which is twice the average of almost every other European country, including some particularly wealthy ones. I commend the amendment to the House.

It is a pity, as Deputy O'Dea mentioned last night, that the rules of the House do not allow us to put practical proposals forward because they would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer. This makes our job, as Opposition Members, difficult. The Government continuously harangues us and asks us to come up with solutions or alternatives, but the rules of the House make that very difficult for us. I urge the Minister, through her Whip - I myself will raise the issue in the context of Dáil reform - to try to change the Standing Order that prevents us from being progressive and positive in our duties as legislators. This sums up what was included in my amendments.

It is traditional in Parliament that when Members put forward an amendment that imposes a charge on the Exchequer, that must come from somewhere within the existing Estimate, and that must be qualified. That is the long-standing tradition in this House, as I know from my years on the benches. As the other spokesman will readily acknowledge, there is no provision for making an amendment to a Bill that involves an extra raising of tax and an extension of a charge that goes outside the particular Estimate.

The ruling makes it difficult for us to do our job. While part of our proposals might involve a charge, there is a benefit and saving included.

Despite the fact there may be a benefit further down the track, we are prevented from contributing, unless the Government takes our suggestion on board.

Budget 2012 gave effect to that and the legislation was passed in its wake and it has been sought to apply this to everyone from April of this year. We objected to this move at the time. We were lobbied by a number of individuals who were fast approaching retirement age, only to discover that their pension entitlement would be only a fraction of what they had expected. This measure seems to affect women in particular. It seems the legislation overlooked some small categories of contributions and since April, some 540 people managed to qualify for the pension with only 260 contributions. What the measure does is ensure the exclusion of those categories from qualifying, unless they are able to reach the higher number of contributions. We favour a move towards a more universal basic pension. Therefore, measures that would further restrict eligibility move in the wrong direction. This measure only affects a small number of people. Given our opposition to it and given the effect it has had on people fast approaching retirement, we feel we should oppose this measure at this stage, although it will not matter so much in a number of years.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	457	As in the case of section 3, the changes I propose in this section also follow on from the pension reform measures I announced in the budget in December 2011, which were implemented from September of this year. Two changes in the State pension contributory scheme are contained in this section, one of which aligns the contribution conditions applying to the pension across all categories of claimant. The other abolishes a provision which is no longer required. Under legislation which was enacted in 1997, the number of PRSI contributions a claimant for the contributory State pension is required to have paid in order to be eligible for that pension increased from 156 to 260, with effect from April of 2002. This further increased to 520, with effect from April of this year. That plan was set out in 1997 and was implemented in 2002, with the final part being implemented in April 2012. The 1997 legislation provided for a number of consequential amendments and for "savers" to protect existing pensioners. However, the 1997 legislation inadvertently omitted to provide for the increase from 260 to 520 in the case of a particular category of claimant for the contributory State pension. The 260 contribution requirement still applies in the case of claimants for contributory State pension who have a reduced yearly average of between ten and 20 contributions. This means that this particular category of claimant is treated differently from all other claimants for contributory State pension, including claimants for other reduced rate pensions who are required to have paid a minimum of 520 PRSI contributions. Section 4 aligns this requirement in the case of all claimants for contributory State pension who reach pension age from 1 January 2013 onwards. Existing recipients of the contributory State pension will not be affected by this measure. Section 4 makes a further amendment to abolish a provision which is no longer required. Special pension arrangements were introduced in 1988 to cater for people who had been affected by the operation of the earning limit for insurability purposes that applied in the case of non-manual workers before 1974. In those days, a distinction was made between manual workers and people who worked in offices. Manual workers paid a stamp, but middle management and other office workers who had access to company pension schemes did not. Before the pre-1974 arrangement was changed, certain people who had gaps in their social insurance records relating to periods when they were not covered by social insurance found it difficult to meet the existing reduced yearly average requirements for the purposes of the contributory State pension. In those circumstances, special lower rate pensions were introduced to cater for these groups. The range of reduced rate pensions generally available to claimants of the contributory State pension has been improved since 1988. As a result, there is no longer any difference between the reduced rate payable under these special arrangements and the reduced rate of the contributory State pension generally. As a consequence, section 4 of the Bill proposes to abolish these provisions in the case of those who reach pension age on or after 1 January 2013. Existing beneficiaries of these special pension arrangements will not be affected by this measure.

It proposes a reduction from €1,700 to €1,375 in the annual respite care grant. I had intended to make a longer contribution on this matter, but I am aware that many Deputies want to speak on it. I have received many e-mails on this issue. I hope that by reading from an e-mail I have received from a carer which has been signed "a very tired woman", I can capture everything I had intended to say:I am the mother of 3 children, 2 of whom have special needs. My children need 24/7 care, 365 days, that is every single day since they were born, there are no holidays away with them or from them, I am all they have as their father died last year. This cut in the respite grant plus the children's allowance having a 10 euro cut per child plus the cut in the household [benefits] package plus the increase of medical prescriptions has left me in tears, literally tears. As a one income family, I can't work as my daughter has so many therapies and hospital appointments, there is no job in the land who would employ me if I was to go to Galway Monday for hospital appointments and Dublin for treatments Thursday and the other side of Mayo for dental treatments another day, let alone the rare but needed speech therapy that was hard fought for. I barely am able to pay for the car that takes us to all these places by the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the tax/insurance is paid by the Respite Grant, the petrol is almost covered by the children's allowance but not now. It's a struggle to shop every week, to keep oil in the tank, coal on the fire, and God forbid, a letter comes home from the school looking for money for something or one of them need new shoes or rips a trousers or the car breaks down, my nightmares revolve around that, when I can sleep of course [and] as I said, my special needs child is 24/7 and sleep is a luxury at times. The money I get weekly/monthly/annually is earned, every single cent. 325 euro is small change to most in this government, it's a meal for the buddies and the 20 euro a month I am losing on children's allowance is the equivalent of ONE bottle of wine with that meal. Small change to those who can change our lives while they have never known financial insecurity or what it is to ceiling stare in fright and fear thinking and worrying about how am I going to last another 3 days with no money in my purse or bank. This government has us hard against a wall though, they know we can't protest in the thousands that we are because we can't bring the people we care for out of their homes into the streets in a lot of cases. They know we will never abandon our people like the government has.That is part of a longer e-mail. I urge the Minister to examine her conscience and the Government to examine its collective conscience. They need to reverse this cut. They should delete this section of the Bill. The e-mail from which I have read captures all of the despair and distress it is causing. The consequences of this cut will be felt on the collective conscience of the Government. I have mentioned that I have received e-mails from many distressed parents and carers who have contemplated the worst. I urge the Government to give them some hope by deleting this section. We have set out some of the alternative ways of gathering the small few million euro involved. If the Government does not act, it will have electoral consequences for the Deputies on the other side of the House and the poor carers in our society who are struggling day in, day out. The Minister referred to them as unsung heroes, but I suggest that was an insult to them. One looks up to one's heroes. One praises and supports them in their times of need. By introducing this measure, the Minister is not supporting them.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	467	This is one of the main areas people believe should be protected. The Minister has made the point that this grant was approximately €700 or €900 in 2004 and suggested she is not really eating into it. This measure will have huge repercussions for every single person who is caring for someone and also for the person who needs such care. The Government should reverse this cut because it did not form part of the remit it was given when it was elected to office. It is not good enough. The amount involved is just €26.15 million. Our next amendment outlines how this and all other cuts can be reversed by taxing wealth and incomes of more than €100,000. Deputies have an opportunity to act in line with the words they spoke when they made their promises a number of months ago. Those who look after people who need to be supported every day, week and month of the year are the unsung heroes of our society. There is a great deal of anger and the protest was smaller today. People are saying if the Government implements this cut, they will bring those for whom they are caring into accident and emergency departments and leave them there in order that the State will have to look after them. They do not believe they are being given enough support to care for those who need care. They have also said word is getting out, in the context of The Gathering next year, that one should not come to Ireland if one needs care, etc. I ask the Minister to delete this section of the Bill and support the people in question. She should not claim that the sum of €325 is insignificant in the context of all other benefits and supports they receive.They need this money. The cost of living has gone up, in particular for electricity, gas and bus fares. Many would have travel passes but the fact is people are finding it more difficult to live and they need that protection and support. We are not asking for increases at the moment. We are asking the Minister please to not cut the respite care grant.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	468	I listened with interest to the e-mail read out by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. I have also received numerous messages and it is distressing just to read them, let alone try to imagine the distress those unfortunate people and those they are caring for are enduring. I appeal to the Minister. People outside the House who watch the exchanges, clashes, debates and interaction here would be surprised at how many things we privately agree on. If all of the 166 Deputies were asked privately, off the record, what their opinion of this change was, I suggest they would all be of the one view, whether they were Government or Opposition Deputies. They would simply be of the view that it is a mistake, it is unfortunate, it looks very bad for the Government and it is a pity it happened. I am not attributing any superhuman qualities to the Minister for Social Protection. We are all human and we all make mistakes. I am nobody to lecture anybody on mistakes as I have made more than my fair share. However, I have learned in life that the best thing to do when one makes a mistake is to acknowledge it, correct it if possible and move on. It was George Bernard Shaw who said there was no shame in admitting one has made a mistake; it only means one is wiser today than one was yesterday. To anticipate some of what the Minister might come back with, one of her central defences of the social welfare provisions in the budget is that she has not cut the basic rates. The fact is that everybody in receipt of carer's allowance is entitled to the respite care grant, so their income is not just the €204 per week, it is €204 plus the total of the respite grant which, divided by 52, comes to €32.50. Therefore, it is €204 plus €32.50, which makes €236.50, in effect. As a result of this change, they will come out with €6.50 a week less. There are a minority of people who, for one reason or another, do not qualify for the carer's allowance, perhaps because their spouse's income is too high or over the limit. Nevertheless, they are doing a tremendous job of caring on a full-time basis for somebody who is disabled or ill. In return for that work, they get a measly €32.50 per week from the State, and that is now being cut to €26.50, a 19% cut for that particular category. Incidentally, we should bear in mind that carer's allowance is a means-tested payment so people who qualify for the carer's allowance are certainly not the rich. They must pass a means test, and while this is more generous than the ordinary social welfare means test, it is restrictive enough nonetheless. The Taoiseach told us on the Order of Business in recent days that the Government is spending over €780 million on carers this year. I accept that and I acknowledge it is a fair chunk of money. However, the contribution which carers are making to this State, if the State had to pick up the tab for the work they are doing, is estimated by independent economists at approximately €5 billion per year. This is the only category of social welfare where we are getting back a multiple of what we are giving out. As somebody said recently, carers are the only recipients of social welfare who are actually working for the money they are getting. God knows, even as it stands, it is paltry enough for the amount of work. There is nobody in this House, or nobody I know outside it, who works harder than a full-time carer - that is a fact. My mother died earlier this year. She was in a nursing home and two of my sisters took turns to visit her and stay with her. Even that - taking turns and visiting somebody who was being cared for by somebody else - really exhausted them. I cannot even begin to imagine what it is like caring for somebody on a full-time basis. As I said, the State gets back six or seven times what it puts into carers. The amount of money involved here is €26 million, which is a drop in the ocean in a budget adjustment of €3.5 billion. We are told it cannot be changed but nobody has explained why. Last year, there was a bigger adjustment in regard to disability and it had to be changed and was changed. Ministers came out and said they had got it wrong, and they were respected and admired for that. There were a few journalists who wrote headlines about U-turns and so on, but people appreciated the fact Ministers saw they had made a mistake and were good enough to stand up and change their minds in regard to a much bigger amount. We are also told that if the €26 million has to be found, it has to be found elsewhere in the social welfare budget. Why? What particular rule of accountancy or arithmetic dictates this? In any case, while I am sure the Minister could find it elsewhere within the social welfare budget, she does not have to. Some €26 million is less than €2 million across each of 14 Government Departments. If the 14 Departments are so strapped they cannot find a sum of less than €2 million each to make this up, then the slightest adjustment to the taxation system would provide €26 million without affecting the budgetary arithmetic at all. The commitment to the troika, as I understand it, was to come in this year at a deficit of not more than 8.3% of gross domestic product. The Government has pointed out, as it is entitled to do, that it is coming in at 8.2%, which is under what is required. The sum of €26 million will not change that arithmetic one iota. Like other Deputies, I met carers outside Leinster House last week and many of them have been in contact with me in recent days. The one issue that was really distressing them was the chasm between what they were experiencing and suffering and the stated views of certain Members in here. One Minister of State said they could stay in a top hotel for €700 a week and told them to get on with it. It is very easy for a junior Minister to express sentiments like that because a junior Minister is being paid 13 times per week the basic rate of carer's allowance. A junior Minister could earn the €325 which is being cut from the respite care grant in less than a day - their basic earnings are approximately €380 per day, before expenses and other ancillaries such as drivers, free telephones and so on. What a crass, unfeeling, unsympathetic approach to take from someone who is doing so well. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, when on this side of the House used to throw moral imperatives like lollipops, with several per day and three or four at lunchtime. He said this was a "modest" reduction. It might be a modest reduction for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, because he is earning €169,000 a year or 17 times the basic rate of carer's allowance. He earns €470 per day, seven days a week. By 3 p.m. today, Deputy Rabbitte will have earned the equivalent of the cut in the respite care grant. In general, I find that if one believes one is going to subtract from rather than add to the sum of human knowledge when one speaks, it is better not to speak at all.

These include the extent to which we can activate the domestic economy, the situation in the eurozone, whether a debt resolution agreement is reached with our European partners and so on. Whether or not this particular cut is imposed today will not make the slightest difference to where Ireland stands economically in 12 months. This decision is very bad politically for the Minister's party. I accept that she does not need political advice from me, but the reality is that it will leave an indelible stain on the record of this Government and particularly on that of the Labour Party. There is no need for that to happen. Financially, it will make not an ounce of difference but will impose disproportionate hardship on the people who least deserve it. I urge the Minister - I am doing so in a non-partisan way - to reconsider this decision. From her own point of view, it is not worth the candle.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	471	I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is not accompanied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, today. After all, this is a Fine Gael budget. I have no doubt that if the Labour Party had framed it, the measures that we are discussing would not have been included. It is the Fine Gael Party that is driving economic policy and putting us in a situation where these measures have to be brought forward. I have no interest in what Fianna Fáil has to say. I am not a part of that political tradition, nor am I part of the political tradition of Sinn Féin. I am part of the tradition of the labour movement. I joined a trade union when I was old enough to work and the Labour Party when I was old enough to vote. In fact, I voted for the Minister, Deputy Burton. I was a socialist as soon as I was old enough to reflect on the inequalities that exist in our society. We have been told that there are no alternatives to the measures set out in this Bill. If I could accept that as truth, I would vote for the legislation. The reality, however, is that there are plenty of alternatives. As Susan George, the great American writer, observed, the world is full of alternatives. Proposals in this regard have been made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Claiming Our Future and TASC. My colleagues, Deputy Thomas Broughan and Ms Nessa Childers, MEP, and I have presented options. Alternatives have been offered by virtually every progressive voice in Irish society, pleading with the Government to reverse the cut in the respite care grant and child benefit and instead to impose higher taxes on people earning more than €100,000 per year. In response to a recent parliamentary question by Deputy Michael Conaghan, it was revealed that a tax rate of 48% on incomes above that threshold would bring in €365 million per annum. That cannot be done, however, because Fine Gael will not allow it. The Labour Party has a choice, therefore, either to agree to a compromise which is not sufficient or to stand up to its partner in government. Last year the Minister, Deputy Burton, and others disagreed with my decision to vote against an austerity budget. I respect their position. However, I do not accept that a single voter sent me into this House to cut the respite grant for carers and take €10 from the allowance paid to every mother in this country. These decisions are shameful. It is even more shameful that outstanding members of my party will be forced to vote for this measure out of some blind faith and loyalty to an archaic 19th century Whip system which demands adherence to the party line irrespective of personal convictions. It is my conviction that these cuts are wrong and alternatives could have been chosen. For God's sake, let us stand together to effect their reversal, no matter what the consequences. I urge the Minister to accept the amendments to this end.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	472	Even people who are not affected by the reduction in the respite care grant are deeply concerned by it. In fact, it has become a lightning rod for public dissatisfaction with Government policy. If the Minister listens to the people in her own party and in Fine Gael, she will discover that they all have their antennae up and have realised that this measure is unacceptable. It is purely a case of stubbornness and the desire to save face that is behind the claim of there being no alternatives. As others have stated, there certainly are alternatives to what is proposed in this measure. The Minister argued that the respite care grant has increased substantially in recent years. The reality, however, is that the demands on that payment have also increased. For example, the cost of home heating fuels has increased significantly. People engaged in caring work face a disproportionate cost in this area because they are predominantly doing so in their own home. The cost of health care has increased. Moreover, the reduction in front-line services means that the respite care grant is very often used to plug gaps such as the lack of speech and language or occupational therapy. The notion that it is used in some type of frivolous way, that it is there for the little treats or extras, is completely to misunderstand the purposes for which it is used by the vast majority of recipients. In most cases it is not about paying for a week's holiday. Even if it were used for that purpose, to afford some rest and respite for carers, it would probably make a great deal of sense from a health care perspective. One third of all carers become ill themselves as a result of the stresses and strains of looking after another person 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I will conclude shortly because I know that colleagues are anxious to speak. I referred in this Chamber earlier in the week to a woman - a constituent of the Tánaiste - to whom I had spoken outside Leinster House. She told me that her house is locked down at all times because she is caring for her young adult child who has autism and cannot access adult services. The young person is essentially a flight risk. This woman and others like her have taken grave offence to this cut because they feel they have been singled out. Everybody in society is offended that this vulnerable group is being targeted once again. I appeal to the Minister to show a little bit of sense and reason on this particular measure. Even if it is the only change she agrees to, it would at least demonstrate a degree of humanity. If she does not want to hear what we on the Opposition benches are saying, I urge her to heed what Government backbenchers have said. This decision is simply wrong.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, announced on budget day that subsidies for pension funds which deliver an income of more than €60,000 per year will be capped. This cap, which is projected to bring in €250 million in a year, is not due to come into effect until 1 January 2014. If this measure were brought in sooner, on 1 July, for example - which independent experts have indicated is entirely possible if the political will is there - it would bring in €125 million next year. I realise there would be an off-set for the levy that is currently there, but that could be adhered to for the remaining months of the year. Even if the introduction of the cap were delayed to 1 September 2013, it would potentially bring in €80 million. In the context of the number of cuts that are being proposed in the legislation today, has the possibility of bringing forward the pension subsidy cap been considered seriously at Cabinet and, if not, why not? It is a budget adjustment that has been agreed with our partners in government, so it simply seems to be a question of timing. Given that the respite care grant is not payable until June, there is time to consider whether an earlier implementation of the subsidy cap might obviate the need for a reduction in it and other income supports.In the area of child benefit, for example, €125 million would go a long way towards obviating the need for that cut as well.

The people the Minister is hitting with this measure will also be affected by cuts to the clothing and footwear allowances, child benefit and the property tax. We are talking about many hundreds of euro being taken from the income of people who are doing a service to the State by looking after their loved ones. To take this action is obnoxious and nauseating. One cannot describe it as fair; it is obscene and indecent. The Minister has claimed consistently she had no alternatives in this regard and had to make hard choices. I find the use of the word "hard" extraordinary. What carers do is hard, in fact "hard" does not even come close to describing what they have to do. They must engage intensely at an emotional, physical, economic and every imaginable level in order to care for their loved ones, thereby providing a service at a massive saving to the State. To do this to them is unconscionable. The Minister stated there were no alternatives but when alternatives are put to her and to the Government she merely reiterates that headline allowances are being maintained and sings her own praises. Will she answer us directly and simply? Why did she make the choice to do this rather than to increase, even marginally, the tax on those with incomes of more than €100,000 a year? Will she answer that simple question? This point was made by her Labour Party colleagues, and all the groups in civil society mentioned by Deputy Nulty have asked her to do this, but we still have not had a straight answer. Instead of doing this, why would the Minister not increase the PRSI levels for those earning in excess of €100,000 a year? It is a simple choice and is contained in an amendment we tabled. The Minister could do it, and save all this hardship and suffering for people who do not deserve it, those who are the most decent people and the real heroes of our society. Will the Minister not pull back from this and show them the respect they deserve?

She cared for my mother for seven years and has been taking care of my father for eight years. Unfortunately - or fortunately for us - most of my family work and are unable to help her out, but we know she works 24 hours a day because my father needs that level of care. In light of the work she does and the hours she puts in, I have often thought that if she worked anywhere else in the world her work would be classified as slave labour. There would be uproar and understandable outrage that people should work so hard for so little. That is the salient point in this debate. Whatever small amount of money we are taking away, to do so is unforgivable. I have spoken to many carers in both Waterford and Dublin. Next week there will be a Private Members' Bill on carers, which we hope the Minister will support. What is deeply upsetting for many carers is not that the Minister has taken the money away but that her Department would sit down and contemplate attacking the most vulnerable and hard-working people in Ireland today. If she speaks to carers, as she must do because all of us have done so, she will see they are deeply upset. I say that rather than "annoyed" because we are all annoyed at things now and again. Carers are deeply upset that members of the Minister's Department would sit down with her and even think about making this cut. As one who sees what a carer does, I make an appeal. I am sure other people present also have carers in their families, but I see what my sister does. She is very small, weighs only about seven stone but I know what she has to do 24 hours a day with my father, and what she had to do for my mother before she died. What upset her was not that the Minister took the money away but that she sat down and thought about doing so.  I will leave it at that because other people wish to speak. I appeal to the Minister on this, above all the cuts she has made, because it concerns the people who work hardest in society, some of them 24 hours a day. My sister has to get up five or six times every night. I did the work one weekend to give her a break and did not bother going to bed the second night because I had to turn my father in the bed so often, a consequence of the illness he has. Carers do not deserve to have any kind of cut to their grant. In fact they could do with an increase because of the work they do.

To be honest, I cannot understand how we are having this debate, over €26 million. The Minister is an accountant and I imagine she shares my reaction, to a degree. I can give her 100 better ways to raise €26 million. Next year €170 million will be paid in increments; €700 million has been paid in increments during the past four years. I cannot say better than Deputy Nulty's contribution. To have this type of grief and anguish over €26 million - within the scale of this budget - is beyond me.

It is one of many big ones but it seems to be coming to the top of the pile. On numerous occasions we have heard carers ask what we would do if they were not taking care of their people. One lady pointed out that if she had a breakdown, as she suspects she will if the Minister takes this money away from her, it would cost €300,000 a year to take care of her two beautiful sons. Alternatives have been proposed in the Chamber, even by Government Deputies. Carers have described what would happen if they were not taking care of their charges any more. They have asked what would happen if they left their charges at accident and emergency departments. As Deputy Collins mentioned, some of us have just returned from meeting the carers who were demonstrating outside the House. Four of them made it clear, in consultation with the people they care for, that today they will be leaving four people - human beings - at accident and emergency departments. We talk about respect. What about respecting these people? There does not seem to be any respect from journalists; none of them is present. Neither does there appear to be any respect from Government Deputies - there are only five present. If they had respect for these people they would do something about this. Unfortunately, in this country we have respect for the wrong things. There is a Deputy present in the Chamber who has done a great deal of mouthing off about this topic during the past week but he has not shown much respect today because he has not said anything about the matter. Will he vote against the measure?

I can only presume she has not, given the cuts she proposes to implement. My mother was a carer. I say "was", because she used to care for my father who passed away last August. She never went on a holiday while she was caring for him but used the respite care grant to subsidise my father's medical care so that we could keep him at home and grant him his final wish to die in peace with his family. If we had not used the grant to do that it is possible we would have had no choice other than to put him into a home. We would then have been unable to grant his dying wish. The Minister stated, as did many other speakers in the Chamber, even today, there are alternatives to implementing this measure. A sum of €26 million is in question; every Deputy has provided the Minister with alternatives for sourcing it. For people like my mother and other carers, there is no alternative.These people have no alternative. They either care for their loved ones or they do not do so. That is not a choice they can make. Those to whom I refer do not have the luxury of alternatives or of choosing not to care for their loved ones. The Minister has the opportunity to make a different decision in respect of how to obtain the €26 million at issue here. I appeal to whatever sense of decency and humanity she may possess and I plead with her not to proceed with this proposal. The saving involved is €26 million out of total savings of €3.5 billion. These are just figures. My mother and the other 77,000 carers throughout the country are not interested in figures, they just want to be given the resources and to have the capability to do what is right by their loved ones. If the Minister proceeds with this cut, she may be denying some mother, father, son or daughter the ability to care for a loved one in their own home. In my book, that is just immoral. I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with what is proposed.

When one considers the latter in conjunction with what is happening in the Department of Health, one can see that a combination of things are affecting carers. Sadly, the Minister is caught in the middle of the storm. That statutory two weeks respite to which elderly people are entitled has been removed. Even though there is statutory provision, people cannot avail of this. The cuts to home help hours represent a clawing back of the supports available to people in their own homes. There are those who increasingly rely on the respite care grant to subvent those cuts that are being made by the Department of Health. This highlights the fact that it is not possible to deal in isolation with an issue which has implications across the entire budget. It is extremely frustrating that for one third of those who are in receipt of it, the respite care grant is the only State recognition they get. These people do not receive medical cards or many of the other allowances and entitlements that are available. Those to whom I refer feel really hurt in the context of the proposed cut to the grant. If one considers this cut in tandem with the delay which exists in respect of carer's allowance applications - this currently stands at approximately 11 months - and the impact this has in the context of delays with regard to the processing of the respite care grant, it is obvious that what is happening is placing an additional administrative burden on the Minister's Department and leading to overpayments of supplementary welfare allowance. Efficiencies could be achieved by streamlining the process to which I refer and these, in turn, could give rise to savings. The Bill also contains a proposal in respect of farm assist and I am of the view that this will actually cost money rather than give rise to the saving of €5 million that is envisaged. I have put forward proposals to the Minister regarding how we might save €50 million in respect of the child benefit budget by addressing the issue of fraud and non-resident children. A number of suggestions have also been put forward by other Deputies in respect of the changes to pension relief. If these were brought forward, the savings to which the Minister refers could be made. I accept that the Minister is in an extremely difficult position in the context of the proposed cut to the respite care grant. The saving involved - €26 million - is relatively small in the context of her Department's overall budget. In light of the fact that this proposal will not be implemented until next June - when the respite care grant is due to be paid - I suggest that there is a window of opportunity available to the Minister during which she might reconsider the position. A second social welfare Bill is normally introduced in the spring. In that context, will the Minister postpone what is proposed here and, during the window of opportunity to which I refer, ask the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection to consider the views of and suggestions put forward by those in opposition and come up with an alternative - within the Department's budget - to the €26 million cut to the respite care grant? I am of the view that it would be possible to make savings within the Department of Social Protection's budget by improving efficiencies. The Minister should provide the window of opportunity to which I refer in order that we might take the time to deal with this matter. The provision in this regard will not kick in until the middle or the end of June. Rather than dividing the House on this issue, all the Members should work together to arrive at a workable solution in respect of this matter.

Everyone is aware of the tremendous work done by carers and of the money they save the State by keeping people in their own homes. Like Deputy Nulty and others, I would like to know why the Labour Party dropped a proposal it put forward in the context of the budget to the effect that there be a 3% increase in the universal social charge. Such a move would have brought in €365 million. I gave an interview on my local radio station-----

My figures are wrong in this regard. I gave an interview on my local radio station this morning in which I stated that I would have supported such a proposal if it had come before the House, particularly as it would have removed a number of difficulties for the Minister's Department. I am of the view that the Minister does not believe in what is being done here and that she is going against everything for which she stands by introducing these cuts. Perhaps she will indicate why the proposal to which I refer was dropped and why it was voted down by Fine Gael.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	488	I add my voice to those of others who have objected to this proposal to cut the respite care grant, which is probably one of the most mean-spirited aspects of the budget. We are all fed up listening to representatives of the Government speak about the budget. Those to whom I refer stated - prior to its introduction - that the budget would be tough but fair and they continue to say this. As the Minister is well aware, the budget is nothing like fair. As previous speakers stated, if it had been the case that the Government had no choice but to make these draconian cuts, people would have faced up to the reality involved. The truth is, however, that the Government had several options open to it. For example, it could have increased the universal social charge or introduced a solidarity levy. God knows we need solidarity now more than ever before and if we had introduced a 5% solidarity levy in respect of people with incomes in excess of €100,000 - in the context of the element of those incomes that is above that amount - we could have raised €320 million. I put it to the Minister that a majority of the Members of this House would favour a solidarity levy. Such a levy was first mooted by a number of Fine Gael backbenchers last year - I believe they still support it - and I am of the view there is widespread support within the Labour Party and across the Opposition benches for such a measure. A levy of this nature is necessary because we need those who are wealthy and who have been fairly well protected from the cold winds of the recession to show solidarity with people who are desperately badly off and really struggling. If a solidarity levy had been introduced, it would have negated the need to bring forward any welfare cuts in the budget. Unfortunately, the Government has chosen to hammer people on low and middle incomes. That was a very definite choice that was made within Government. As already stated, it had options. The Government could also have tackled the inequalities relating to the pensions regime. Last year it stated that it would do so this year and now this year it is saying that it will perhaps take action next year. That is just not good enough. There is an obvious target in this regard, namely, making the pensions regime much fairer and thereby saving a considerable amount of money. If the Government had done that this year - as should have been the case - it could have raised €250 million and there would not have been a need for any of these awful cuts which are going to place enormous pressure on the poorest people in our country. The Government had options. In such circumstances, its members should stop saying that the budget is fair. Will the Minister, the Tánaiste and their ministerial colleagues please stop saying that they have protected the vulnerable? They have not done so. They had the option to do it. They could have given effect to that aspiration but they did not do so. They chose instead to leave those in the protected sectors - namely, those who are much better off - alone. Again, these people will not be expected to contribute anything this year. I am already on record as stating that this has something to do with the fact that the 12 or 15 people who drew up the budget behind closed doors are all in receipt of a minimum of €160,000 per year.They are very much removed from the reality of life for so many families who are struggling. Too often, the respite care grant is regarded as an optional extra for families. For those caring for elderly people or people with disabilities, it enables them to meet the additional costs of providing care such as higher heating bills and the cost of special foods needed. In many cases, it enables them to access the critical therapies required such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, all of which have been run down by the Government. This is a hard-hearted cut and reprehensible. I do not see how anybody who promised the public that there would be fairness and owes his or her position here to the making of that promise can support a measure such as this. I urge Members who have any sense of decency to reject this proposal.

If the Deputy has ever cared for someone who is very ill, elderly or in need of care, he will know, as Deputy Denis Naughten rightly described it, it is critical in his or her daily round of work for a carer to know with certainty that a respite place will be available for a definite period of time. This is probably the single most important reform needed in the system.

Every Deputy who has spoken regards it as a very serious issue. Some Deputies or their close family members have personal experience of this work and have described what I know to be the reality. The committee could examine the range of supports supplied. Some Deputies may not wish to hear what I am saying or take it into account, but the level of departmental expenditure this year to pay the weekly carer's payment, the weekly half-rate carer's payment and the respite care grant has increased by €20 million because we are paying more carers. I have provided for an increase in total expenditure next year on carers. In the clamour Members may not have appreciated how much was spent on carers. I concur with Deputy Catherine Murphy that no matter how much money is spent on direct income supports - I refer to the earlier discussion on child care - the services provided are a critical factor. I refer to Deputy Denis Naughten's comment about the job to be undertaken by the committees of this House. Various committees should consider the supports available for children such as those provided in schools and the therapies to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred. They should also consider the important issue of respite care for the person receiving care. Some carers care for more than one adult or one child and they receive a double payment, which is a very important support for them. We should look at all of these factors. However, it must be borne in mind that citizens and taxpayers will be spending more than €20 billion on social welfare payments. Some have suggested there is a lack of solidarity in society, but they are mistaken. I suggest they compare social welfare payments here with those made in very wealthy countries. Our weekly social welfare payments are very high relative to those made in more well-off countries. What distinguishes Ireland from some of these wealthy countries is that our service provision is not as good.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will address the issue raised by Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly of the salaries paid and payments made to workers in the public service as part of a structured discussion. I know many of those who work to provide the services on a professional basis, as opposed to carers who work at home, all my life. They work around the clock and are always available. Deputy Willie O'Dea will remember that the respite care grant was originally introduced to help carers to take a break on the premise that respite care was available for the person being cared for. I accept that the grant is used and spent in a variety of ways, usually for the benefit of the person being cared for. It is to be hoped carers will use it to take a break which would be very good for them. Deputy John Halligan spoke about his sister whose situation is typical and familiar to us all. She is helping to care for her parents at home and her dad is bedridden.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and others referred to other ways to make savings in the social welfare budget.

While the balance and proportions of expenditure and taxes can be varied, the troika has set expenditure ceilings. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly has professional experience, having worked with the World Bank and the IMF, and will know that in countries in which expenditure ceilings are part of the package, they are not as flexible as implied. Some variations are permitted, but total flexibility is not. In fairness to my ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, he has worked with the troika such that the budget reflects the proposed reduction in the pension ceiling - a change I have advocated for a long time.  I refer to Deputy Brendan Ryan's detailed proposal, about which I will speak to the Minister for Finance. It may be a matter for the finance committee and there is a job of work to be done. Given the collapse of the country, the position is difficult. We have to recover to enable us to have the social welfare system we all want.If we do not see the other side of this programme and recover our financial sustainability, the people who will suffer most will be those dependent on the social welfare system. Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh has given as an example a widow with three children, one of whom has special needs. She sent the Deputy an e-mail. A widow who is a carer would receive a weekly widow's pension and half-rate carer's allowance. These benefits, with some others, amount to over €18,000 per year. If the individual has two children in addition to the child who requires care, as the Deputy suggested, this will result in payment of a further €60 per week. Of course, a monthly child benefit payment will also be received. If the Deputy gives me the details of the case in question, we can check the position for him. With regard to respite care, the recipient will be receiving €1,375 next year for the child who requires care. The Irish carer's package is unique by comparison with packages in the rest of Europe. Very few other European countries have a carer's package like ours, but there is a weakness in the provision of services. Deputy Johnathan O'Brien will know this, given the position of his father. If we are to have a discussion on this issue, which I welcome, we should examine holistically how we can have good value services available to those who provide care. This is one of the most important points for a carer. As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, various therapies for children with special needs, particularly therapies associated with speech, language and movement, probably represent the most important services a child can access, in addition to mainstream education.

A couple under 66 years with two children and earning a joint annual income of up to €35,400 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. Such a couple earning up to €60,000 per year can still qualify for the minimum rate of carer's allowance. The Deputy did not mention that carers who work fewer than 15 hours a week have no means test in regard to the respite care grant. That is why the grant is the only payment made to some people. It is because their income is above the level required for the general means test. I refer to the disregards for carers. For the most part, the individuals in question have a significant income. Nonetheless, the State, in recognition of the care work they do, pays a respite care grant to over 6,000 people in respect of whom there is no means test. That, again, is a very positive feature of the system. The payment next year, at €1,375, will still be significantly higher than that in 2006, at the height of the boom. Bearing in mind total social welfare expenditure, several Members mentioned fraud. We have launched very significant anti-fraud campaigns in the Department.

The sum of €20.2 billion provided by taxpayers and those who lend us the funds represents 37% of all Government spending. For those who are concerned about social solidarity in Ireland, €20.2 billion is a very large sum. However, for some Deputies it is not enough. I appreciate this and personally would like if it was more, but in order to protect social welfare payments, we have to return the country to economic sustainability. On the suggestions made by Members, including Deputy Ryan, I will raise them with the Minister for Finance specifically because they have a good deal of merit and merit detailed examination.

It is not all that long ago when the Minister was waxing eloquently and strongly in favour of the poor and the underprivileged. Looking at the budget, there is only one description for it. It is unfair and lacks compassion, particularly in the case of the Minister's Department. It punishes the poor, carers in particular, through the reduction of the carer's grant. Carers believe they are a burden on the State because of the reduction in the fund. They should be looked upon as a very special resource - people who have the skills and the time and who make sacrifices on an individual basis to give love and provide care and attention for their families and others within their communities. Instead of reducing the carer's grant, we should be acknowledging the contribution they make. We should also acknowledge that they are not a burden on the State, but rather that they make a generous contribution to the health and welfare of others. I support the proposal which should be put to the House.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	572	This grouping deals with a change to the Short Title of the Bill and with the inclusion of an area that we now intend to implement. A number of amendments were made to section 1 on Committee Stage in the Seanad. These amendments and the related Schedules are designed to provide for measures which will allow the Central Bank of Ireland greater capacity to co-operate with its counterparts in other countries. Specifically, these amendments, where enacted, permit the Central Bank to sign the International Organization of Securities Commissions', IOSCO's, multilateral memorandum of understanding, MMOU, by the end of this year. In light of the pressing end of year timeline for signing the MMOU, it has been necessary to make these amendments as part of the Bill.  The purpose of the MMOU is to allow the Central Bank to co-operate and share information with other regulators, including other securities commissions around the world, in accordance with international best practice. The provisions being inserted into this Bill are currently part of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011. Colleagues will be aware that Bill is slowly wending its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas. To cut to the chase, we are including the area contained in that Bill in this Bill because of the timeline by which we must sign the MMOU- by the end of the year. If we had to wait until the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, which is due for Committee Stage in January 2013, we would miss the end of year deadline for signing the MMOU. The IOSCO organisation is an international group of regulators, of which the Central Bank is a member on behalf of this country. One of its key functions is to control and provide information to different members on international fraud. The Central Bank of Ireland, as regulator and a member of IOSCO, requested the Government to allow it sign the memorandum and this is the reason we are bringing in section 4. Lest colleagues are concerned this might be some kind of movement two minutes from midnight, that is not the case. The case is we were asked to do this and are bringing it forward from the Bill that is currently only approaching Committee Stage. These amendments were made in the Seanad and the changes envisaged include enacting section 53 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill so that the Central Bank may use its powers on behalf of overseas regulators; enhancing and consolidating authorised officer provisions; and provisions for guarding the Central Bank confidentiality regime. Given that these amendments are not related to credit unions, it was also necessary to amend the Short and Long Titles of the Bill to accommodate them. I would like to emphasise that the expeditious passage of the Credit Union Bill through the House is necessary to allow the €250 million to be contributed to the credit union fund by the end of this year, as there is no scope in the 2013 figures for this to be done after the end of this year. This money is essential for the restructuring process to get under way. These amendments deal with a number of new sections we wish to include to deal with allowing Ireland to extend its membership of IOSCO. I believe the Central Bank would highlight some of the important benefits of membership if it had an opportunity to do so. In the circumstance where there is international fraud or an allegation of fraud through securities, for example, it should be open to member states of the organisation to pass information freely to other member states. Having this memorandum in place will have benefits for Ireland, as a signatory to the agreement, in terms of governance and international regulation. I commend this group of amendments to the House.

I would like to ask an overarching question about the spirit of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.

Is it made clear in the broad thrust of the amendments being introduced that only those elements of the Central Bank legislation that have related to credit unions up to now will apply as we move forward? Will the Minister of State assure the House that the Central Bank legislation will not apply to credit unions in a way that it has not applied to them before now, as an unintended consequence of the amendments?

We are at the final stage of the debate on it. I want to commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, for the way he has engaged with the Opposition on the legislation from the start. I also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, who was involved in part of the discussion on Committee Stage. It is fair to say that at all stages of the legislative process the Minister listened to the concerns of the Opposition about the effect the legislation might have on the credit union movement and all parts of the sector, especially smaller credit unions. I am glad that he introduced amendments in the Seanad after listening to us. Almost 180 amendments are being presented in the House today. It is clear that Sinn Féin would have liked further changes to be made to the Bill and we continue to have concerns about some aspects of it. We will stay in touch with the credit union movement at national and local level and I hope we will not have to return to the issue, but we will do so, if necessary. I am satisfied with the engagement that has happened. It is an example of the true engagement we should have when we are dealing with legislation. I do not want to hark back to what happened earlier other than to say that was not the way to deal with legislation. In fairness to the Minister, he commended me and other Members of the House for introducing practical suggestions. It is clear from the many amendments before the House that our concerns were listened to and I hope we will continue to see that spirit in 2013. I welcome that engagement. I do not have a concern about the group of amendments before the House.

This has been a model exercise in how the Oireachtas should work. Organisations representing the credit union movement made their views known about the Bill initially proposed by the Government. Representatives of various parties listened to those concerns and brought them to the attention of the Government which took action to change the Bill as a result. That is how democracy should work. I would be interested to hear detailed explanations of some of the formulations proposed by the Government, as there may be some issues that we would still like to raise. In general, the Government has engaged genuinely with the Opposition on this matter and listened to the concerns of the credit union movement. The Bill has been improved substantially as a result. Like Deputy Pearse Doherty, I cannot help wishing the Government had engaged with the public and the Opposition on other matters, some of which we discussed earlier today and in the last week, in the same way. If it had done so, it would have enhanced the credibility of the House and politics generally to a great degree. I hope the manner in which the Bill has been approached will be the manner in which the Government will approach other Bills in the future.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	581	This group of amendments will give the Central Bank the authority to sign the memorandum of understanding. When this issue was brought to our attention during the Seanad debate which I attended, the fundamental question I asked related to when this was brought to our attention. I appreciate the constructive remarks the Deputies have made. This is important because a watchlist of countries that have not signed the memorandum of understanding will be circulated by the International Organization of Securities Commissions by the end of the year. We did not want this country to be highlighted for not having signed the memorandum of understanding when other countries had done so. This net issue was part of the original Central Bank Bill which would have been passed. That is why we have brought it forward. I should have sent a note to my colleagues on the other side of the House when this issue was brought to the attention of the Seanad. I should apologise to the House for this, as it was my responsibility. I note the Deputies' comments that they have no difficulty with the signing of the memorandum of understanding. It is important for this country not be on some kind of blacklist of non-signatory countries as we move into next year. I appreciate the Deputies' remarks in that regard. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who ostensibly dealt with the Bill on Second and Committee Stages before I became involved gave a commitment in advance of Report Stage that he would respond in the Seanad to a range of amendments the Members opposite had introduced and teased out at the select committee. He was true to his word in considering these amendments which we have tried to reflect as far as we can in the body of amendments being introduced today. The reason it is imperative for this legislation to get over the line before the end of the year relates to the provision of half of the €250 million required for the restructuring of the credit union movement. The rest of the money will be put up through levies within the organisation. That is why it is important for this work to be done by the end of the year. We had a very fruitful discussion in the Seanad with the Members of that House about many of the ideas championed by my colleagues on the other side of this House. As we go through the amendments, I hope the Deputies in question will see how their ideas are being put into law as a result of the changes made in the Seanad. Deputy Michael McGrath asked a specific question about the definition, with which amendment No. 5 deals. The Minister gave a commitment to amend this legislation to make it clear that only the legislation that already applied to credit unions would be covered by this definition. That will be highlighted when we reach the amendment in question. This will have an effect on what happens in the future. When we reach that amendment, the Deputies will see that the Minister's bona fides are well in tune.

These amendments mirror subsections (6) to (8) of section 14 of the Credit Union Act 1997 and provide for changes to the rules of credit unions consequential on the provisions of the Bill.Amendment No. 4 clarifies that during the first year following the commencement of this section, the rules of the credit union may be amended by a resolution of the board of directors rather than by the members of the credit union where such changes are necessary to comply with the provisions of the Bill. Amendment No. 48 provides for a reduction in the number of board members from 15 to 11 by amendment to the rules of the credit union.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	586	This arises from the proceedings on Committee Stage in the Seanad. I brought forward an amendment on Committee Stage to address concerns relating to the definition of financial services legislation. During Report Stage in Dáil Éireann and Second Stage in this House I indicated that I would bring forward an amendment to clarify that it is only legislation that already applies to credit unions that would be covered by this definition. The amendment made on Committee Stage in the Seanad provides the clarification sought. I know this was an issue raised by colleagues opposite at all stages when the Bill was being discussed here. The amendment provides that the financial services legislation definition only relates to provisions applicable to credit unions acting under any authorisation from the Central Bank as provided for by law. Such authorisation may include acting as an investment intermediary under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995. The amendment clarifies any misunderstanding that the definition somehow applies a corpus of "banking" legislation to credit unions inappropriately. I again clarify that this definition does not apply financial services provisions to credit unions anew, nor could it be used for that purpose. The perception, that this definition turns on to credit unions a range of new legislative provisions from the wider financial sector, is mistaken.

I welcome the Minister of State's amendment.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	593	A number of amendments were made on Committee Stage in the Seanad in order to set out the principles of regulation making power in these sections by clarifying that the Central Bank may only make regulations in respect of these sections where they are necessary to protect members' savings. These sections provide for borrowings, savings, blending and investments. Amendment No. 20 sets out the basis on which credit unions may borrow money and links it to the purposes of the credit union's objects as set out in section 8 of the Credit Union Act 1997. These include the creation of sources of credit for the mutual benefit of members, the use and control of members' savings for their mutual benefit and the improvement of the well-being and spirit of the members community. Amendments Nos. 24 and 26 provide that the bank may only make regulations that are necessary in respect of credit union lending practices, reporting loans to the credit union and the holding of provisions for loans or categories of loans. Amendment No. 30 inserts a test of necessity in respect of the power of the Central Bank to make regulations under this section. This provision states that the Central Bank may make regulations prescribing the investments that a credit union may invest in, including any other matter the bank considers necessary in the circumstances.

These include a condition that the credit union must notify the bank of significant events, a condition to operate a more limited business as agreed with the bank and a condition to undertake a review of the credit union's business within 12 months of registration to ensure it is compliant with all requirements. Conditions such as these must be necessary to protect the savings of credit union members. Conditions may need to be imposed in the formative years of a new credit union, as it may be required to build up the requirement risk management and compliance controls within the credit union. This amendment also provides that only these conditions that are necessary may be imposed as a condition of registration. Any condition imposed may be capable of being appealed by the credit union to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. These conditions may only be imposed on new registrations, and there have been very few of these in recent years. Further amendments are consequential on this amendment. This applies into the future in respect of new credit unions. Clear powers are given to the Central Bank as a means of ensuring that people's savings, shares and deposits are well maintained.

This section gives effect to recommendation 10.3.27 of the report of the Commission on Credit Unions. It repeals section 27 of the principal Act and replaces it with a provision allowing credit unions to raise funds by issuing shares to members or by accepting deposits. The Central Bank may make regulations in regard to setting limits on the amount of savings or category of savings a member can hold, the ratio of deposits to shares the credit union may hold and any other requirement or limit on the bank consistent with that. Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 are minor technical amendments which allow the regulations to set limits in the form of a monetary amount as well as a percentage.

Following further consideration of the Bill, it was felt that the provisions under section 29, which propose to insert a new section 84A into the 1997 Act, would be more suitable under section 9. The latter deals with the policies, procedures and practices a credit union must have in place to ensure it is compliant with requirements imposed on it. For example, the Central Bank may make regulations imposing liquidity requirements on credit unions under section 30 of the Bill. At present, credit unions have a minimum liquidity requirement of 20%. The amendment allows the Central Bank to make regulations prescribing the operational practices, policies and procedures to be adopted by the credit unions more generally. These may include requiring credit unions to adopt monitoring procedures to ensure the 20% liquidity requirement is complied with. Regulations may also require credit unions to ensure people involved in monitoring liquidity have an understanding of the calculation of liquidity and maturity mismatches. These regulations may also deal with reporting requirements, including arrangements for reporting breaches to the board of directors of the Central Bank. A number of consequential amendments following on from amendment No. 18 were also made in the Seanad.

I am not objecting to that, because it is the purpose of the Bill. However, I have made the argument consistently as the legislation progressed through this House that a memorandum of understanding between the credit union movement and the Central Bank would strengthen the Bill and would be helpful in terms of identifying what each should expect of the other. I have lost the debate on that point and do not intend to re-engage in it now. However, I will make a last-ditch appeal to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, to consider, after the Bill has passed, the merits of having a memorandum of understanding between the credit union movement and the Central Bank. The Minister has made positive soundings in this regard.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	603	To echo Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, the credit union representatives to whom I spoke said they would find it very helpful if the requirements and obligations they must meet were set down in a simple and readily understandable way. The Bill has been much improved since its introduction and we have already had this particular discussion. Nevertheless, I urge the Minister to consider what is a reasonable request by the credit union sector.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	604	I understand the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has discussed this issue with the Deputies. A consultation protocol was established two weeks ago. The Minister's view is that were he to include provision in the Bill for what the Deputies are proposing, that might tie the hand of the regulator and be too prescriptive. The Oireachtas gives the regulator powers on the basis that he or she will operate them in accordance with the independence of the office. The Minister has made clear that he has an open mind on the issue. As I said, the consultation process is now established and we will glean something from that. However, the Minister is not proposing at this stage to formalise it in the way the Deputy has suggested. We do not wish to cut across the very important work of the regulator in this matter or to tie his or her hands. I hope common sense and judgment will prevail in dealings between the Central Bank, the regulator and the credit unions, which will ensure there is no need to impose prescriptions on the regulator. A memorandum of understanding is a more formal way of specifying what we all want to see, namely, a proper protocol for dealing with these matters. We will keep a watching brief on the situation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	605	An amendment was made to section 11 on Committee Stage in the Seanad to provide for a transitional arrangement whereby an approval by the Central Bank under the existing section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act 1997 in respect of longer-term lending by a credit union would continue to have effect upon commencement of this section. The amendment simply clarifies the existing position in order to put it beyond doubt.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	606	This amendment was made on Committee Stage in the Seanad. It is a minor amendment to rectify an incorrect cross-reference in the text.

This amendment arose out of discussion with the Office of the Attorney General on the issue, and makes clear that the power of the Central Bank to make regulations relating to investments includes scope for making regulations in respect of investments in public projects. The Minister remains open to credit unions coming forward at an early stage to outline their proposals in respect of such investments. A further amendment to this section was made in the Seanad. What the Minister has done in the amendment we asked the Seanad to agree - as it did - is effectively to include public projects for the purposes of allowing the Central Bank to make regulations. I know that was a key concern of Members opposite.

It is one of the most important moves to acknowledge explicitly in the Bill a very positive suggestion made by the credit unions. In these rather bleak times when we often argue with one another about what not to do, and desperately look around for positive suggestions about what we might do, this is a positive, forward-looking and imaginative proposal by the credit unions that can benefit everybody. Not only is it important to include it in the Bill but I urge the credit unions, as did the Minister of State, to come forward with their proposals so that we can look at them and thereby take this suggestion seriously. It seems as if some of the desperately needed investment funds we would all like to see made available to invest in employment-rich and socially valuable projects are being offered to us by an organisation whose members have the best interests of this country at heart. It is a very positive move and I hope we not only include it in the Bill but also that we take up this suggestion and seek to develop it.

I would have preferred a more explicit statement on State-guaranteed public projects but I recognise the wording presented by the Minister of State does not prohibit this, so I find it acceptable. As the Bill passes into law, I acknowledge the Minister of State's comment that he is open to meeting the credit union movement. It is now up to the movement to step up to the mark. It has been seeking this amendment and therefore it should come forward with proposals. It is equally important that the Department of Finance should co-ordinate a position that can be proposed to the credit union movement. This would state the kind of investments envisaged, would point out that the credit unions had wanted the measure and note that it has been enshrined into law in terms as clear as day. It can ask them what their proposals are, ranging from small, medium and large packages. These may be the concern of the Department with responsibility for housing or the Department of Education and Skills, which can put them together with the co-ordination of the Department of Finance. It is a two-way street. I welcome this move.

This amendment is to be welcomed. It is satisfactory and gives explicit recognition to the possibility of credit unions investing in projects of a public nature, which is something they will welcome. I share Deputy Doherty's view that this option should now be explored fully by credit unions.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	611	I hear what all the Deputies are saying. There is an opportunity here to do something imaginative. Although this section is all about ensuring that credit unions use their investments with judgment and common sense, there must be a recognition that where public projects arise that could have a mutual benefit for credit union members in communities known to credit unions, it makes sense to invest in them, having regard to any potential risks. The way we approached this in the amendment was to give power to the Central Bank to bring forward the regulations. This seemed to get over the legal hurdle that had been present up to the point when we had our discussions with the Office of the Attorney General. There is nothing to stop the Department of Finance, with other Departments, as Deputy Doherty suggested, bringing forward ideas and proposals or a scheme of ideas, in tandem with the regulations the Central Bank will make. This is positive because it is about delivering for an entire community. Such a community also looks to the future as to where its investments can best lie and how community benefit can best be obtained. They are the people who know best, and that can be tempered by a standard form of regulation which the Central Bank can stand over. I believe we are all in agreement on that.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	612	Amendment No. 33, made in the Seanad, makes provision for the election of the board of directors at the first annual general meeting or special general meeting called after the organisation meeting of a new credit union. This amendment was necessary to ensure consistency between the ways the board oversight and the board of directors are elected. It provides a transitional arrangement for the election of the board of directors at the first agm or sgm, following the commencement of the section. This was necessary given the decrease in the maximum number of directors that may be appointed to the board under this Bill - a reduction from a maximum of 15 to a maximum of 11, which was well debated on all sides. On Committee Stage in the Seanad I noted there were incorrect cross references in these amendments and stated I would bring forward amendments on Report Stage to rectify these inconsistencies. They should refer to section 53(15), not to section 53(16). These amendments were made on Report Stage in the Seanad and the correct cross references have now been included in subsection (6).

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	614	I refer to amendment No. 34. An amendment was made on Committee Stage in the Seanad to remove subsections (12) and (13) of section 15 as these will be provided for in a new fitness and probity regime which will be rolled out for credit unions on a phased basis, as recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions. Further amendments were also made to amend the cross references caused by the deletion of subsections (12) and (13) by amendment No. 37. Amendment No. 51 amended paragraph (f) in section 17(1). This section previously provided that a person performing management functions in a credit union must have particular knowledge, skills, experience, qualifications, competence and probity to carry out these duties effectively. This was deleted by an amendment in the Seanad as it would be covered separately under the fitness and probity regime which will be rolled out for credit unions over time. In effect, we are removing the fitness and probity references because they are surplus to requirements given that they will be rolled out over time. The application of fitness and probity requirements was agreed by the Commission on Credit Unions and will apply, depending on the nature of the scale and the complexity of the credit union concerned. Amendment No. 52 deleted paragraph (p), as it referred to requirements set out in subsections (12) and (13) of section 53. As these subsections were being deleted, paragraph (p) is now invalid. Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 also make the consequential cross references arising from the deletion of paragraph (p).
Amendment No. 73 deleted paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5) of subsection 63A, as inserted by section 21 of the Bill.When appointing a person as manager, it is necessary to ensure that the person appointed complies with all legal requirements. The list of requirements that a manager must fulfil has been deleted as these standards will also be set out under the fitness and probity requirements which will apply to credit unions in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Credit Unions. These measures will be rolled out to credit unions over time and they will take account of the size and scale of credit unions. This amendment ensures that the person appointed as manager will comply with all legal requirements, including those prescribed by the Central Bank. Further amendments were made on Committee Stage in the Seanad in order to correct the cross references arising from the deletion of section 53(12) and (13), as inserted by section 15 of the Bill.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	621	This group contains the amendments about which Deputy Doherty is concerned. A number of amendments were made on Committee Stage in the Seanad which relate to eligibility for membership of boards of directors and which arose as a result of constructive debates with Deputies and Senators in both Houses in recent weeks. The effect of these amendments will be to reduce the exclusions that would apply to members of boards. There was a great deal of discussion in respect of this matter on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, gave a guarantee to the effect that he would introduce amendments. These are the amendments before the House. I accept that not everyone will be satisfied with them but we have gone as far as possible. Amendment No. 35 allows volunteers from a credit union, as well as a member of the board oversight committee of such a credit union, to serve on the board of another credit union. That is the first substantial change and it means that if a person is a volunteer with one credit union, he or she can serve on the board of another. That was the first exclusion we overturned. Amendment No. 36 removes the prohibition under which family members of volunteers on credit unions may not become directors. This was the second exclusion, under which, if a person was a volunteer in a credit union, he or she was excluded from serving on the board. The Minister stated that he would introduce an amendment in this regard and he has done so. This amendment also removes the express exclusion of members who have been in arrears on their repayments for more than 90 days. Instead, it provides that credit union rules should deal with the eligibility of such members. Amendment No. 174 follows on from amendment No. 36 and provides that the rules of a credit union must set out how it will deal with a member of the board of directors or board oversight committee who is in arrears of more than 90 days, up to and including suspension or removal of that member. Amendments Nos. 95 to 111, inclusive, and 113 relate to exclusions from the board oversight committee. There was much constructive debate in the Dáil and Seanad in respect of the eligibility for membership of board oversight committees. A number of amendments were proposed in respect of section 53(10) in the context of changes to the exclusions from boards of directors. These amendments were proposed in order to ensure consistency between boards and board oversight committees. Their effect will be to reduce the number of exclusions that would have applied in respect of membership of board oversight committees. Amendment No. 95 allows volunteers from other credit unions to be on the board oversight committee of a credit union. This matter arose on foot of Committee Stage proceedings in the Dáil. Amendment No. 106 removes the prohibition on family members of the credit union becoming members of the board oversight committee. Amendment No. 96 allows a director of another credit union to become a board oversight committee member. Amendment No. 108 clarifies that a member of the board oversight committee of the credit union cannot also sit on the board of directors of the same credit union. Amendment No. 104 makes a change to the exclusion of auditors from the board oversight committee. This exclusion will now include a person employed or engaged by that auditor and is designed to guard against any conflict of interest in the context of a person having worked in other credit unions or possessing information about what is occurring in another credit union. Amendment No. 109 deletes section 76N(4)(q) in line with the changes for exclusion from board membership. Amendment No. 110 ensures that where a committee member falls under any exclusion provisions, he or she should resign from the committee.

There is no doubt about that. Consequently, many of the concerns that were voiced have been met. However, there is an issue outstanding in respect of the voluntary aspect. I will not rehash the debates in which we have engaged on this matter. We will monitor what occurs and if difficulties arise, we will return to this matter either in the form of a Topical Issue debate or on Private Members' business. I encourage the Minister of State and the Department to monitor this provision in order to gauge its effect. I understand what the Minister and Minister of State have been saying during the debates on the Bill in the context of ensuring that we have the best governance. However, we must also ensure that the latter does not impact in a negative way on the sector and, in particular, on smaller credit unions. The second matter about which I am concerned relates to the exclusion of a staff member of a credit union from serving on the board of another credit union. There was a way to do this in the context of the conflict of interest provisions. Again, I will not revisit the debate on this matter. What I will say is that those who are voluntary assistants within credit unions or who serve on boards of directors may obtain employment in other credit unions as a result of the experience they have gained. The Bill will have the unintended consequence of forcing such people into making a choice between their job and their position on the board of directors. Such individuals or their parents may have been involved in the founding of the credit union in question and they will not be placed in a nice position. Cases of this nature may be few and far between but we should not put anyone in the position to which I refer. I accept, however, that it is too late to tweak the provision but perhaps we can revisit the matter in the future. I strongly support the other amendments that have been put forward in this regard. I refer, in particular, to amendment No. 36, which relates to circumstances in which a person is in arrears and will be excluded from the board of directors as a result. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, such members should be forced to resign with immediate effect. It is very important that this will now be the case. I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this amendment. This is the only part of the Bill to which I am strongly opposed. Amendment No. 35 is actually better then the provision contained in the Bill, but it does not go far enough. That is why I wish to place on record the fact that I remain opposed to the relevant exclusions. I ask the Minister of State to monitor the position with regard to voluntary assistants and to give particular consideration to the provision under which a person will be asked to choose between his or her job and his or her membership of the board of directors. My final point relates to amendment No. 124, which is in a later group. That amendment is relevant to the matter under discussion because it deals with the exemption clause I suggested on Committee Stage and in respect of which I tabled an amendment on Report Stage. The Minister for Finance signalled that he was open to such a clause. Amendment No. 124 deals with that issue to a certain degree.

I will discuss this matter further when we come to that group of amendments. However, it does not deal with the issue of a voluntary worker or a person working for another credit union. The issue of term limits could also apply in this instance. I suggest a waiver if the Minister of State is not willing to remove it altogether. Amendment No. 124 could have been expanded to include dealing with the prohibition on serving as a director in the case of voluntary assistants and staff of another credit union. It would be solely at the discretion of and with the permission of the Central Bank. This might be another way by which we could have addressed the issue. I suggest we return to it at a later stage.

I welcome, in particular, the amendment dealing with directors who find themselves in arrears. An amendment was necessary in this case. The restrictions are unnecessarily onerous, particularly when it comes to volunteers. It is often the case that the members of a board of directors are mature in years with time on their hands. It could be argued that working voluntarily for the credit union every week enhances their role as board members and gives such individuals a greater understanding of the operation of the credit union. This restriction is unnecessary, but it remains to be seen how it will work in practice.

I echo the points made about the removal of the exclusion on persons in arrears. However, the democratic principle of credit unions may be somewhat undermined - the right of members to make these decisions and judgments about the people they wish to serve on the board. I welcome the improvements, but the Minister of State should keep an ear to concerns or problems that may arise as a result of the exclusions which continue to be provided for in the Bill.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	629	I agree with colleagues that the amendments have improved the section substantially by doing away with the more ridiculous exclusions. However, there is a fundamental distinction between a volunteer and an employee or a director. The credit union is a unique organisation which has given so much to the country. We need to arrive at the correct balance. The next group of amendments deals with the term limit - 12 years out of 15. I made the point yesterday on Report Stage in the Seanad that it was only when the Bill was passed by both Houses and became law that all these sections would apply. For example, a person may have served for 30 years, but he or she will only be appointed as a director next year. The Bill will be another transition for the credit union movement and it is certain this issue will be considered again in the next few years. I understand the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty. The next group of amendments provides that the Central Bank is empowered to put to one side the exclusion if a credit union cannot find people because of the term limit. The Deputy has argued that the same should apply to volunteer and employees. I understand the logic of his argument. When this new regime and the transition period begin, we may need to look at any problems with the exclusion of volunteers. Beginning with the report of the commission, there has been an argument that this distinction is needed to ensure potential conflicts of interest are minimised and that the best governance system will be in place for all credit unions.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	631	I tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad to increase the term limits of members of the board of directors. This arose from discussion with colleagues opposite on Committee and Report Stages in this House. On Report Stage the Minister for Finance had stated he intended to bring forward an amendment, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, to change the term limits to 12 years in aggregate in a 15 year period. This commitment is now reflected by the amendments made in the Seanad which strike an appropriate balance between promoting board rotation and protecting the volunteer ethos of credit unions. Seanad amendment No. 66 is consequential on this amendment to increase the term limits from nine to 12 years. Seanad amendment No. 64 increases the maximum consecutive term for the chairman from three years to four. The term of office of the chairman is for a period of one year. Currently, a chairman is not permitted to serve more than three consecutive terms in that post. The Minister agreed on Committee Stage to increase the maximum consecutive term for the chairman from three years to four. This will ensure continuity in the board. However, it will also be one of the responsibilities of the nomination committee to ensure board continuity. Seanad amendment No. 124 permits the Central Bank to appoint a director, even where that person may have exceeded the limit. This is the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty when speaking on the previous group of amendments. The bank can give a credit union the power to appoint someone, even if that person is beyond the term limit. In the course of the debate on Committee Stage and again in the Seanad a discussion ensued on a waiving of the term limits in exceptional circumstances. The Minister undertook to examine this proposal. The issue to be addressed is whether the term limits could result in a credit union being unable to attract enough suitable directors. The Bill already provides that the Central Bank can require a credit union to nominate additional directors where the board is lacking in skills or expertise. The director so nominated must be approved by the Central Bank. The Bill has been amended in order that the time served as an additional director in these circumstances is not reckoned for the purposes of the term limit. This means a director who has already served his or her 12 years in a15 year period could still be appointed to the board, but only in these exceptional circumstances, if there is a deficiency in expertise and agreed to by the Central Bank. This addresses the concern raised without undermining the core principle of the Bill on term limits.

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, made the point a number of times that he wanted to retain the principle of rotation.

Given the Minister of State has provided for exceptional circumstances, I hope that, if everybody is being reasonable, the concerns expressed by the credit unions will be addressed adequately. However, I never really received a satisfactory answer to one question, bearing in mind the importance ascribed to the principle of rotation and the imposition of term limits. If term limits are considered so important for credit unions, why are they not imposed on banks, for example? Why does the Government attach so much importance to term lmits for credit union directors? Why do we not have a problem in this regard and with certain other conditions that applied to staff who served in our banks over the years? Will the Minister of State explain this?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	636	I do not support term limits. The credit union movement is a democratic movement. In the same way that this institution, a democratic one, does not have term limits, credit unions should not have any either. The issue is dealt with and we lost the debate but I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has extended the term limits. I welcome the exclusion, waiver or whatever the Minister of State wants to call it that I suggested on Committee Stage and furnished on Report Stage. It is basically encompassed in amendment No. 124, which deals with the term limits. The provision is not as strong as I would have liked. It refers to an additional director. I am not sure about this because I obviously have not been on the board of directors of a credit union. Consider the circumstances if we add up the exclusions that exist in terms of voluntary assistance, employees of other credit unions and account for the real and necessary requirements we place on directors of credit unions to be fit for purpose and have knowledge and experience. In a small credit union, one could limit the pool; therefore, this is a question of additional directors and not about circumstances where a credit union cannot fill its complement. Scope is provided to allow that to happen. I hope the procedure will not be cumbersome. Under section 90, the review must be carried out by the Central Bank. One must go to the credit union nomination committee to suggest a director one feels would be fit for purpose. The bank must agree that and then the director is appointed for the period up to the next AGM. After an AGM, the procedure could take nine months, after which the director may only be in office for three months before leaving. The provision is really to ensure that the board does not lose experience and will have the necessary experience to carry out its functions properly. I am a little bit concerned but perhaps my concern is ill founded. The Central Bank will obviously have to work out the procedure. I want to ensure the process is not cumbersome. The legislation does address my concerns in regard to the points on directors. We could have given full discretion to the Central Bank in respect of a voluntary member of staff or a member of staff from another credit union. I can understand the conflict that the Minister of State talked about in regard to a staff member of one credit union being a director of another, and the need for one to be fully aware of the books and all the various projects. If the section encompassed this, it would be up to the Central Bank to determine whether the employee of a given credit union would have a conflict of interest if he or she were a director of another. The amendment would be very safe. We cannot do anything about this at this stage but we could and should have examined it. Perhaps we will do so.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	637	We all share the common goal of ensuring that credit unions have the requisite number of staff with suitable qualifications and skills required to do the job they are being asked to do. Deputy Doherty made a fair point in asking whether we are now accepting a pretty cumbersome set of circumstances whereby, if a credit union found it did not have the correct range of skills required on its board, it would make an application to the Central Bank, which would decide on the position, after which a name would come forward that the bank would have to sanction. If this applies, it is because the credit union makes the application to the Central Bank on the basis that it feels it does not have the requisite number of people to serve the purpose in question because of a lack of skills or expertise. This gives the credit union the power to make the first move. However, Deputy Doherty's point is important in that it is a question of what happens next. This issue is one that the Central Bank needs to be mindful of in circumstances where it is trying to expedite an application on behalf of the credit union. Certainly, any help that the Department of Finance can bring to bear on the bank to speed up the process and putting in place a code of practice in this regard would make sense. On the remarks made by Deputy Boyd Barrett, there have been many investigations into banking but we have not had a commission yet. What we have attempted to do is put the legislative requirements in place to deal with the issues concerning credit unions. Without wishing to reopen cans of worms, I am pretty happy that the Government has addressed virtually all the issues concerning the directors who were in place in the various credit institutions, whether we own them or not, and that the institutions have a new governance system in place with new staff who will, I hope, recover the banks on behalf of us all.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	644	The amendment sets out new provisions concerning the suspension and removal of directors of the board oversight committee. Issues arose during the debate in the Dáil about the procedure for the suspension and removal of directors, particularly in relation to the directors concerned being provided with written notification of the board oversight committee's reasons for taking action under this section. The Minister, on both Committee and Report Stages in this House, indicated his willingness to look again at these provisions and the amendment reflects the changes necessary in order to address the concerns raised by colleagues in the House. The amendment brings the procedure for the removal of a director at a special general meeting convened under this section into line with that for the removal of a director from office by members of a credit union which is set out in section 56 of the 1997 Act, thereby ensuring greater procedural consistency from one Act to the next. Under this section, the board oversight committee can suspend a director where it considers that a member has taken an action or decision which is not in accordance with Part IV of the 1997 Act. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett proposed an amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil which was accepted by the Minister and provides that the board oversight committee is required to give written notice to the director setting out the reasons for its decisions before suspending the director or convening a special general meeting of the credit union to consider whether to remove the director. Where a director is suspended by the board oversight committee under this section, the suspension takes effect immediately and if that director does not resign within seven days of being suspended, the committee shall convene a special general meeting to review the suspension and consider whether to remove the director. At a special general meeting convened in accordance with this section the members may ratify the suspension, rescind it or remove the director from office. The amendment provides, in a similar manner to section 56 of the 1997 Act, that a director is entitled to written notice of a special general meeting to be held under this section not less than 21 days in advance of the meeting. The amendment also sets out the procedure for the director in question to make written representations in advance of a special general meeting and that the director has the right to be heard orally at such a meeting. The Minister is confident that the amendment addresses the concerns raised by Deputies in this House.

It is regrettable that the constituent who raised the issue with me is not in the Visitors Gallery, as he has been here to follow some of the proceedings on the Bill. I will not say this has been a labour of love for him, but it has been an issue he has been pursuing for many years. He has specifically sought to have the word "written" inserted in the Bill. The amendment allows for a clear and transparent record to be given of the reasons provided by the board oversight committee for suspending a director of the board. It spells out the steps for proceeding with such a suspension and how the person proposed to be suspended can state his or her case. This is a good amendment and I commend the Government for taking it on board. A person raised a related issue which probably does not come under the Bill. That person believes there is not an adequate procedure in place for individuals to make a case to the regulator where there is a dispute over the rights and wrongs of a suspension and that there is a need for the Central Bank to ensure there will be a fair procedure in place all the way up the line to allow individuals to appeal a decision in a case if they are unhappy at any stage of the process. That there is now a requirement for reasons to be given in writing will at least ensure a level of transparency about decisions that might be made in this regard.I welcome the amendment. I am sorry the individual in question is not here to see a little bit of his idea being enshrined in law. I am sure he will be very pleased, however, and that it will have the desired effect.

Seanad amendment No. 123 ensures the proportion of liquid assets to be kept by a credit union will take account of the nature, scale and complexity of a credit union, ensuring that a one-size-fits-all approach is not taken and that the composition and maturity of a credit union’s assets and liabilities is also taken into consideration.This is line with the commission's recommendations on a tiered regulatory approach. This was in the Bill as published but was mistakenly removed from the Bill as amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil. These amendments clarify the issue and, as I noted in the other House yesterday, make it clear that the tiered approach will not compromise small credit unions or those which have a different range of depositors. That is what these three amendments are for.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	666	Seanad amendment No. 133 provides that employees of auditors engaged by ReBo are subject to the non-disclosure of information provisions in this section. The amendment ensures consistency in the application of the non-disclosure provisions which the Bill currently applies to employees of agents, consultants and advisers appointed by ReBo.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	667	Seanad amendments Nos. 135 and 136 are related and may be discussed together.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	668	Seanad amendment No. 135 made on Committee Stage in the Seanad removes the requirement for the Minister for Finance to obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before approving the appointment of staff by ReBo. The staff of ReBo will be paid out of the credit union fund and, as a result, the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to their appointment is no longer required. ReBo can, therefore, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, appoint such staff and at such grades as it may determine. Amendment No. 136 made in the Seanad makes the provisions relating to the appointment of the staff of ReBo consistent with those of the appointment of the chief executive of ReBo. Section 54 now mirrors the provisions concerning the appointment of the chief executive set out in section 53. Section 54(2)(a) restates section 54(2) as published following Committee Stage in the Dáil and provides that the terms of appointment of the staff of ReBo may be determined by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform subject to the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. Section 54(2)(b) as provided for in the amendment made in the Seanad sets out an alternative means of determining the terms of appointment of ReBo staff. These terms may be determined by the board of ReBo subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance with consent from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	669	This amendment provides that the board of ReBo may direct the chief executive to undertake certain functions relating to the accounts of ReBo. This amendment reflects that the board of ReBo and not the chief executive is responsible for keeping the accounts of ReBo and submitting those accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Therefore, it is appropriate for the chief executive to act under the direction of the board of ReBo rather than with the agreement of the board.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	670	Seanad amendments Nos. 138 and 170 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	671	This amendment splits section 57(1) into two subsections to provide clarity on the effect of disclosure of information by ReBo on any duty of confidentiality or on any obligation under the Data Protection Acts. Section 57(1), as amended in the Seanad, provides that a credit union which discloses information to ReBo does not breach any applicable duty of confidentiality. The new section 57(2), created by that amendment, sets out that a credit union may disclose to ReBo personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Acts. This amendment ensures that there is a legal gateway between credit unions and ReBo for the disclosure of information. Amendment No. 170 inserts a new paragraph (h)
into section 71(2) of the 1997 Act, which will allow officers of a credit union to disclose confidential information to ReBo and facilitates the sharing of information between the credit unions and ReBo. ReBo will protect the confidentiality of the information shared under section 51 of this Bill.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	672	Amendment No. 139 adds a number of purposes of the credit union fund to those already listed in section 50(2). This amendment sets out that discharging the expenses of ReBo, the cost of collecting levies due under the Act and the expenses of the bank in exercising its functions are purposes of the credit union fund.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	673	Seanad amendments Nos. 140, 141 and 143 to 145, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	674	Amendment No. 140 is a technical amendment which improves the consistency of terminology in this Part of the Bill by removing the references to "restructuring purposes" and replacing them with "the purposes of restructuring under this Part". Amendment No. 141 removes the obligation on the Minister to obtain the bank's approval of an amalgamation or transfer of engagement under section 131(6)(a) of the 1997 Act before providing financial support for the purposes of restructuring. This amendment sets out that the provision of such support may be conditional on the bank giving its approval under this section rather than requiring that approval before the support is provided. This will permit the bank to consider the conditions proposed to be attached by the Minister to the provision of support and the bank can decide accordingly whether to grant approval. Amendment No. 143 is a technical amendment which updates the cross references to other sections of the Bill dealing with the provisions of restructuring and stabilisation support. Amendment No. 144 clarifies that the support referred to in section 58(7) is stabilisation support. Amendment No. 145 clarifies that the conditions referred to in section 58(4) are those attached by the Minister under section 58(6) to the provision of stabilisation support.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	675	Seanad amendments Nos. 142 and 161 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	676	This amendment provides that the Minister may provide stabilisation support to a credit union from the credit union fund where requested to do so by the bank. The provision for the Minister to attach terms and conditions to any support provided is retained in this amendment. Those conditions are primarily intended to relate to the recoupment of funds provided as financial support under this Act. Amendment No. 161 clarifies that the bank may request the Minister to provide stabilisation support in accordance with section 58(6).
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	677	On Committee Stage in the Seanad I brought forward an amendment to delete section 58(10). I also brought forward an amendment to section 60 of the Bill which provides the Minister with the power to make regulations prescribing the rate of contribution by credit unions to the credit union fund for the purposes of the provision of stabilisation support under section 58(6). Stabilisation support will be made available out of funds raised through this levy. Therefore, section 58(10) is no longer required and was deleted by this amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	678	Amendment No. 148 makes a minor amendment to the terminology used in section 59(1)(a) and provides for the keeping of "accounts of receipts and payments of the credit union fund" rather than "all proper and usual accounts".
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	679	Seanad amendments Nos. 149 and 153 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	680	Amendment No. 149 corrects a typographical error. Amendment No. 153 deletes unnecessary wording relating to section 61. Section 61 is a discretionary provision and, therefore, it is not appropriate to provide for an obligation to comply with that provision.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	681	Amendment No. 150 sets out the Minister's powers to make regulations prescribing the rate of contributions or method of calculating the rate of contribution to the credit union fund by credit unions in order to provide the credit union fund with sufficient funds for the provision of stabilisation support. Section 60(2) already provided that the Minister may make regulations prescribing the contribution to be made by credit unions to the credit union fund in order to recoup the cost of financial support provided for the purposes of restructuring. This amendment provides a similar power in relation to stabilisation support to be provided from the credit union fund. This gives effect to recommendation 8.5.8 of the commission report, which recommended that the necessary financing of the credit union fund for the purposes of stabilisation should be sourced from the credit union sector.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	682	Amendment No. 154, which is in the definitions section of the Bill, was moved on Committee Stage in the Seanad. It changes the definition of "stabilisation support" to clarify that such support may include funding unrelated to the reserve requirements. Such funding may be used to update the systems and controls of the credit union and may also include the provision of financial and technical advice to the credit union. This was a recommendation of the Commission on Credit Unions as set out in paragraph 8.5.6 of the report.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	683	Seanad amendments Nos. 155 and 156 are related and may be discussed together.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	684	Amendments Nos. 155 and 156 were also made on Committee Stage in the Seanad. Amendment No. 155 amends subsection (2) by deleting the existing paragraph (b) which states that the Bank may only approve stabilisation support caused by a short-term, non-recurring event. Instead, amendment No. 156 sets out when ReBo may recommend to the Bank that a credit union should be stabilised. During the period of restructuring, a credit union may not be assessed for stabilisation support unless ReBo makes a recommendation to the Bank that the credit union should be stabilised. A credit union must not be part of the restructuring proposal or must have reserves greater than 7.5% before ReBo can make that recommendation. This will ensure that the restructuring process and the stabilisation process are aligned.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	685	Amendment No. 157 updates the citation of the Central Bank Acts, which are amended by Part 5 of this Bill.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	686	Amendments Nos. 158 and 159 are related and may be discussed together.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	687	These are two minor technical amendments that were made to this section in the Seanad. Amendment No. 158 clarifies that the support referred to in paragraph (c) is stabilisation support as opposed to restructuring support, while amendment No. 159 changes the reference from "this Part" to "this Act" as stabilisation support is to be provided by the Minister under Part 3 rather than Part 4.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	688	Amendment No. 160 clarifies that the bank must have regard to the terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate to attach to the decision to provide stabilisation support when making a decision on the approval of stabilisation support to a credit union. A previous amendment gave the Minister the right and the power to attach terms and conditions and this is simply ensuring that the Bank will make sure these terms and conditions will apply. These terms and conditions will deal with issues such as recoupment, which may affect the Central Bank's assessment of viability.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	689	I brought forward an amendment in the Seanad to delete section 67, which provided that the cost of stabilisation support and any other support, financial or otherwise, required as a condition of stabilisation support shall be met from the credit union fund. Any moneys recouped from a credit union in respect of support provided would be paid into the fund. This section was removed, as subsection (2) is covered by section 58(6) and 58(2) and is covered also by section 58(9).
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	690	Seanad amendments Nos. 166 and 172 are related and may be discussed together.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	691	Amendment No. 166 is a minor amendment made on Committee Stage in the Seanad which inserts a reference to section 37D of the Credit Union Act of 1997, which sets out the information to be included in the credit agreement notice to the credit union members. This item in the Schedule is required to ensure that there is consistency between the 1997 Act and the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010, which apply to credit unions. Amendment No. 172 clarifies that the supervisory authority referred to in item 100 is the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. Seanad amendment agreed to.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	692	Under the previous wording of item 37, the Central Bank could exempt certain additional services which involved "no undue risk" to the credit union. Amendment No. 167 removes the reference to "undue risk" in respect of additional services that the Bank may exempt from the application requirements under section 47 of the Credit Union Act 1997. It was felt that this wording was too restrictive and could have limited the instances where the Bank could exempt certain services from additional requirements provided in that section. Following the amendment made in the Seanad, the Bank may exempt such services which would be for the mutual benefit of its members.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	693	Amendment 171 made in the Seanad inserts a new paragraph (d) into section 87(2) of the 1997 Act which allows the Central Bank to impose a regulatory direction on a credit union under section 87 where that credit union fails to comply with the terms and conditions of any stabilisation support given to the credit union under this Bill. This is necessary to ensure that conditions imposed in return for financial support to keep the credit union afloat are enforceable. These could be called the troika conditions. This direction will be appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal under section 52 of the 1997 Act.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	694	This amendment removes the ministerial regulation-making powers that existed under section 182 of the 1997 Act, as these powers conflict with the bank's regulation-making powers under the Bill and are more appropriate for the Central Bank. These relate to the registration procedures and operations of credit unions.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	695	Agreement to Seanad amendments will be reported to the House and a message will be sent to Seanad Éireann acquainting it accordingly.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	696	I thank the Deputies opposite for the constructive role they played at all Stages of this legislation. I hope the Bill, which passes this House today and will now go to the President, ensures the great Irish credit union movement, which is a standard-bearer of volunteerism and financial support, will continue to flourish in the years ahead. The Bill is consistent with the report of the commission in setting out new standards and a roadmap for the development of the movement. I also thank the officials of the Department of Finance who have worked day and night to ensure this Bill could be passed by the end of the year.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	697	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Mick Wallace - the decision-making process behind the allocation of national lottery funding to sports clubs; (2) Deputy Thomas P.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	698	I move: "That Second Stage be taken now."
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	699	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to present this Bill, which will give effect in Ireland to the mandatory introduction within the European Union of unisex premiums and benefits in private insurance to which Council Directive 2004/113/EC applies. This directive, known informally as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services. In its decision of 1 March 2011, in case C-236/09 taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of this directive was invalid, with effect from 21 December 2012. This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the European Union. The provision thus struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data. Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover, and private annuities and pensions. The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit by law the selling of private insurance products which differentiate by gender on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012. The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date. It also applies to agreements between parties, as and from 21 December 2012, to extend contracts concluded before that date which would otherwise have expired. The European Commission has issued guidelines on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing directive 2004/113 and on insurance industry practice. I have taken due regard to this guidance and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid sudden readjustment of the insurance market in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to comply with this ruling. As I will explain shortly, these amendments are largely technical in nature. For me and for my colleagues in Government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the intended impact.  The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike resulting from these changes to the private insurance market. For this reason, in October the Department published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice. The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board. I would like to express thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - who contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers. I also thank the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens' Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau. I would now like to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill. Section 2 provides for amendment of section 5 of the Equal Status Act 2000. It limits the existing derogation from the prohibition on gender discrimination in specified insurance products, provided in section 5 of the Equal Status Act, to contracts concluded before 21 December 2012. This is to ensure the prohibition on gender-differentiated insurance, with effect from 21 December 2012, does not affect existing contracts lawfully entered into before that date. The scope of the prohibition is then expanded by providing in a new subsection (4A) that all contracts within the categories of motor or life insurance concluded for the first time as and from 21 December 2012 must comply with the unisex rule. For the avoidance of doubt and because to determine otherwise would result in a sudden readjustment of the motor insurance market, contrary to the intention of the directive, the second paragraph of the new subsection provides that mid-term adjustments to motor insurance contracts concluded before 21 December 2012 are not considered to be new contracts for this purpose. Finally, this section provides that the obligation imposed on the Central Bank of Ireland to compile, maintain and publish data to support the existing derogation ceases to have effect from 21 December 2012, while not affecting its obligation to maintain and publish data compiled before that date. Consequential to the cessation of this obligation, section 5 provides for the amendment of section 41 of the principal Act. It has the effect of terminating the Minister's power, which is no longer required, to make regulations with regard to the data to be compiled, published and maintained by the Central Bank. Section 3 provides for amendment of section 14 of the principal Act to clarify that insurance providers may continue to collect, store and use gender status or gender-related information which is genuinely intended for the purposes of reserving and internal pricing, reinsurance pricing, and life and health underwriting. For example, it is envisaged that insurance providers may continue to gather and use gender data in connection with offering gender-specific insurance products and options within contracts to cover conditions which exclusively or primarily concern males or females, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. I have also taken the opportunity afforded in this Bill to address a minor procedural issue regarding equal status complaints referred to the Equality Tribunal for mediation. Section 4 provides for amendment of section 24 of the Equal Status Acts to extend the time available to persons who have referred such complaints to apply for resumption of the hearing in instances where mediation has not resolved the dispute between the parties. The amendment will extend the period, after the issue of a notice of non-resolution, within which a complainant is allowed to make an application in writing for a resumption of the hearing, from 28 days to 42 days. This amendment applies the same conditions to complaints under the Equal Status Acts on failure of mediation as are already applicable to resumption of complaints under the Employment Equality Acts. The remaining provisions are of a standard or technical nature. Before concluding, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the technical nature of these amendments, while reiterating that the State has no option but to ensure national law complies with the European Court of Justice interpretation of the gender goods and services directive in this instance. I thank the Members of the House for their attention and I look forward to a detailed discussion on the Bill. I commend this Bill to the House.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	702	That is fine. I thank the Minister of State. We accept that we have to amend our legislation because the derogation period is coming to an end. On that basis, we understand where the Minister of State is coming from. We are supporting the Bill. We do not have any particular issue with it. When the Equal Status Act 2000 was introduced, it was a ground-breaking measure. Its effects on people's participation in civil society were felt throughout the country. It was right that so many sections of society, including religious and political organisations, had to ensure they offered a level playing field to both genders. It was important that many clubs and associations in this country experienced a mini-revolution when they had to rewrite their constitutions and go about their business differently. It went a long way towards promoting a greater mix and a greater balance with regard to the participation of women in organisations. Unfortunately, there were one or two high-profile instances of organisations in Dublin not abiding by the new law. One particularly high-profile golf club refused to amend its rules to allow women to become full members. It was regrettable that they did not comply with the spirit of the legislation. Neither I nor my party would subscribe to the notion of having exclusive men-only organisations in a modern society. Perhaps we should review the complete effectiveness of the Equal Status Act 2000 by carrying out an audit, in so far as possible, of how it is being complied with by organisations throughout the country. That could be done in many ways. Our local authorities, for example, have a substantial active database of all community and voluntary organisations, including sports clubs and non-sporting organisations. If we could audit and monitor the level of compliance with the 2000 Act and the impact it has had, it would be a worthwhile exercise as it would be something we could refer to in time. If that is done, I am sure it will find that the legislation in question has had a very positive effect on the promotion of gender balance and a greater mix of participation by both genders. One of the major concerns associated with the Bill before is that it will lead to an increase in the premiums to be paid across a number of insurance policies. I suppose the week after the budget is probably a bad week to discuss another increased bill that households will have to face. Given that the derogation will cease on 21 December next and will not apply to new insurance policies written after that date, it is unfortunate that so many insurance premiums are renewed in early January. The timing of this measure is particularly cruel because it means that many people will face increased insurance premiums late this year and early in the new year. In that context, I would like to know whether any regulatory impact assessment was carried out by the Department. Was that possible? If so, was it published? It might serve to inform the public. The final issue I would like to raise with regard to this Bill relates to the financial services industry. Many of the organisations that underwrite this business are banks. As we know, some banks are involved in insurance as well as banking. Insurance is one of the many aspects of their financial services activity. We will have to keep an eye on how they treat the application of this change in the legislation. We must ensure they do not use it as an excuse to hike up premiums further than the actuarial people tell them they need to do. In other words, they must not use it as an opportunity to try to grow their capital bases further, or engage in another capital-gathering exercise. People are being squeezed by the banks on many fronts. This should not be viewed by the banks as an opportunity to squeeze the consumer a bit more. Consumers are being absolutely squeezed dry. The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank should have a role in ensuring the banks do not engage in opportunism. Unfortunately, we have learned to our detriment from our experience that the banks will take every opportunity possible to add a greater margin to the margins they are already squeezing out of people with the other products they are selling. Did we get the observations of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland as part of the regulatory impact assessment? Did that office make any input during the drafting of the legislation? Has the Department had any particular interaction with the ombudsman in that regard?

This Bill has had to be introduced on foot of the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the derogation in the EU gender directive that allows gender to be used as a risk factor in determining insurance costs is illegal. While we are on the matter of European courts, I would like to mention briefly that it is a shame the Government does not seem to hold the European Court of Human Rights in the same regard. I assume that is why it has not legislated for the X case as required by the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C v. Ireland. There is a point to be made here about the role of statistical evidence about risk factors when the price of insurance is being determined. Insurance premiums are based on risk factors. In general, women pay lower premiums as there is a lower risk attached to them. Geographical location is a further risk assessment factor. Insurance costs are much higher in some parts of the country than in others because a higher proportion of road traffic accidents takes place in such locations. My concern about this Bill is that it will not result in lower insurance premiums for male drivers, but higher premiums for female drivers. While it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender, I am aware of some insurance companies in Britain that have introduced interesting initiatives to ensure women are not unfairly penalised in their insurance claims. Some insurance companies in Britain are offering discounts for young driver schemes, as well as safe driver schemes in which premiums are reduced for both genders where there is a demonstrable record of safety over a period of time. I hope insurance companies here will do the same.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	704	I thank both Deputies. I assure Deputy Niall Collins that there was extensive consultation with the entire insurance industry, as well as with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau of Ireland. The level of consultation was quite significant. People will always say there could have been additional consultation, but in this case I do not think that would have been possible. Anyone who was seen to be a stakeholder in this sector, including the consumer, was consulted. As we all know, this measure has resulted from a case that was successfully taken in the European courts by a consumer group in Belgium. I know people are very conscious of what others pay for their insurance. We tend to know what is being paid. I appreciate what Deputy Collins said about the mortgage protection, income protection and life assurance products offered by banks. This Bill will not affect life assurance unless it is to be taken out after 21 December next and is therefore considered to be an ongoing contract rather than a new contract.Where the major impact will be felt is in regard to new car insurance after 21 December. Equality is a funny thing. As a woman, I see how it will affect women but, on the other hand, as Deputy McLellan rightly said, if we take out the gender issue, insurance companies will surely be able to take account of the fact that someone is a safer driver, as they have done in the past. No matter what gender they were, in the past unsafe drivers would see their insurance costs rise if they were involved in crashes. It is this type of detail that will be necessary. Equality is a funny thing. As a woman, I see how it will affect women but, on the other hand, as Deputy McLellan rightly said, if we take out the gender issue out, insurance companies will surely be able to take account of the fact someone is a safer driver, as they have done in the past. No matter what the gender was, in the past an unsafe driver would see their insurance cost rise if they had a crash. It is this type of detail that will be necessary. While I hate to say the following, it is a fact. People taking out insurance products, whether from a bank, a broker or directly from an insurance company would be wise to get at least three quotes. Just because a person is getting a mortgage from a particular lender does not mean the person must take insurance from that lender. Sometimes people do not realise this or forget it, and while there can be a degree of pressure, customers should resist it. Comprehensive and detailed information leaflets are available both on the Department's website and on the website of the Citizens' Information Bureau. These have been available on the Internet for some time because we knew this was coming, and all the information the average citizen will need is available. This is a brief but significant Bill that will have an impact on people's lives in the future. I hope those in the insurance industry will be sensible and take into account that someone is a safe driver, whether male or female. I thank the two Deputies. It is late on a Thursday evening and I know what it is like to have to stay when the Dáil sits late.

For elderly people, the disabled, the immobile and the disadvantaged, the home help scheme, along with the other care schemes, is invaluable. The benefit of the health budget to the economy as a whole is obvious. Supporting and maintaining people in a home setting for as long as is practical and possible is very desirable. There has been a whole sequence of adjustments and cutbacks to the home help scheme, particularly the number of hours available to particular families. While I will not cite the individual cases that have cropped up in the Louth-Meath East constituency, I am sure they mirror the position across the country. I exhort the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to take a serious and urgent look at the scheme. It is so valuable to people living in a home setting that this bears reiteration time and again. Even at a time when resources are scarce, there is a need to prioritise, and there is certainly a need to prioritise the home help scheme. I encourage and exhort the Minister of State to urgently re-examine the situation to see whether additional resources can be made available to support this scheme.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	709	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which is one that needs to be discussed on an ongoing basis. The aim of Government policy remains to support older people in living in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This objective is realised through various community-based supports such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite provision. Our aim is to develop and improve community-based supports where possible, taking account of wider reforms of the health service, the overall resources available and the need for the HSE to meet its statutory budgetary obligations. The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach nationally to all relevant aspects of its home support services. These include various new guidelines for home care and agreeing a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing such services on a partnership basis on behalf of the executive.While ongoing developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other key aspects of planning and delivering services, for both providers and care recipients alike. The HSE service plan for 2012 originally envisaged some 50,000 recipients of mainstream home help and approximately 11,000 recipients of enhanced home care packages at any one time. Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE home care towards the end of this year, investment in these services remains significant, with expected outturn expenditure of approximately €320 million for home help and home care packages in the course of 2012. The recent measures adopted by the executive were designed to secure a reduction of approximately €8 million in expenditure on home help hours to the end of December, equating to some 400,000 hours, and a reduction of approximately €1.2 million on home care packages. Every effort has been made to ensure the impact of these reductions will be minimised for individual recipients so that services are provided, in the first instance, for direct patient care. Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours continue to be based on a review of individual need and no current recipient of the service who has an assessed need will be without a provision. The latest information available from the HSE indicates that in balancing overall projected financial savings for the home help budget nationally against maintaining adequate service in individual cases, it will probably not meet the savings target envisaged. The Department continues to work closely with the executive to monitor the position between now and year end. I emphasise again that in addressing very difficult financial realities overall, protecting community-based services for vulnerable older people continues to be a priority for the Government. However, the challenge facing the HSE in drawing up its 2013 service plan should not be underestimated. I am pleased, therefore, to reiterate our commitment to restore to 2012 levels of service the core community services of home help, home care packages and personal assistant hours.

I am somewhat disappointed, however, that the underlying message seems to be that the position is as it is and the prospect of enhanced provision for those who are down to three quarters of an hour of care under the home help scheme are poor. I ask the Minister of State again to examine those cases where the curtailment of hours is such that it is unrealistic to expect that the type of care and support required by individuals and families can be met within the assigned allocation. I have no reason to question or doubt the provision contained in the Estimate for this scheme. Moreover, I accept the financial constraints with which the Minister of State is dealing. However, this is an absolutely invaluable scheme. If we get to a position where a person of 82 or 83 years of age can be maintained in a home setting for another 12 months rather than being taken into institutional care, there are benefits not only for the individual but also for the State. The arithmetic dictates that providing more resources in this area is in line with best public policy. I urge the Minister of State to endeavour to secure greater resources for the scheme.

I attended the meeting at which she outlined in great detail what is proposed in this regard and attempted to allay some of the fears that were raised from the floor. The difficulty, however, is that the communication breakdown between the HSE and parents' groups remains a problem. Several of the parents who attended the public meeting and whose children are attending special needs schools had received virtually no information on the proposed reconfiguration before the Minister of State provided some of the details. From speaking to parents in recent days, it seems this communication deficit has not yet been addressed. There are parents who are still not aware of the plans that are being implemented. This is something that needs to be taken on board by the Department. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the meeting that took place last Monday in the HSE offices in Cork at which parents of children with special needs had an opportunity to voice their concerns about the changes that are taking place. I assume she received the minutes of the meeting, as did I, which clearly point to the concerns that remain outstanding and which must be addressed as soon as possible. One of the main concerns relates to the issue of parent representation on the implementation groups. The answer attendees received to queries as to whether there might be increased representation was that the proposed complement of four is larger than that in other geographical areas. In other words, the message was that four parent representatives is more than enough. That position must be clarified. At the same time, there is a genuine concern among parents that the requirements of the parent representative role go above and beyond what they should be asked to do. The Minister of State will recall from the public meeting she attended that many people are concerned that anybody who accepts the role of parent representative on the implementation group will be held responsible for all of the decisions made. I accept that the Minister of State sought to clarify this matter at the meeting, but that fear persists. The other main concern among parents is how the changes can be implemented on a cost neutral basis. In fact, there is a genuine view among parents that it is simply not possible. Nobody has yet been able to provide them with details or a plan for how to improve the services and implement the proposed reconfiguration on a cost neutral basis without impacting on front-line services. If the Minister of State could outline how that is proposed to be achieved, it might ease parents' fears. There was a debate at the public meeting around the need for a mapping of services. An argument is being put forward that such mapping should be in place before the implementation groups are established. To do it the other way around would seem to be putting the cart before the horse. Will the Minister of State comment on that? There is a danger that parents will be pitted against parents. The minutes of last Monday's meeting show there are already differences of opinion, with parents of children attending mainstream schools or units attached to mainstream schools indicating a wish to proceed with nominating representatives to the implementation group as quickly as possible.On the other hand there are parents of children attending special schools who are very wary about nominating representatives and proceeding with the implementation group. We are already seeing a kind of breakdown within the implementation groups, with parents not being able to agree on the best way forward. The other concern that came out of the meeting, which I hope will be addressed, was that parents were being asked to partake in the groups but they did not have all the documentation and did not know what the overall plan was. No policy documents were provided to them for studying before they were asked to join the implementation groups.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	715	Every parent wants the very best for their child. If one has a child with particular needs, or needs that are different from those of other children, there is always a fear the needs of the child will not be met in the future. That is a normal feeling, something one must accept and realise happens. On the implementation groups and whether the mapping should be in place, I reiterate what I said at that meeting, namely, both can run in tandem. There is no need to hold one up while waiting on the other. Mapping is vitally important, as I have always maintained. I refer to the Progressing Disability document, which is part of a suite of measures we are taking in the area of disability. It is a very good document that outlines delivery of a service in the community. I understand that people in specialist schools have a difficulty with that taking place. I realise they are happy with the service they have and do not want to lose it so this reaction is very understandable. The difficulties I heard about on that day were in terms of where children must go in order to receive the service, and the type of environment they will face. It should be possible to sort out all these things - they are not impossible tasks but entirely solvable issues. However, there are swathes of children in the community going to mainstream schools who do not have access to any services. I am not one who says we should run madly ahead with the project or that it is cost-neutral. Nothing is cost-neutral. Even moving something to a new location is not so because one has to look at the location and see what is needed. We must try to ensure that every child has access to a service. The mapping should tell us where the gaps are, which is key to the whole issue. If we find there are gaps in the area of speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychology and all those things, it will then be my job, or that of whoever stands in this position next time around, to ensure the resources are put in place to fill those gaps. That is what we did in mental health and what we are about to do in the area of older people and old age psychiatry. It is what we need to do. Above all else, we must ensure every child has access to a service. This is not an overnight project; it will take at least three years. I heard the parents talking about their fears that day and these are genuine fears. Nobody wants other than the very best for their children. I would say to those people they need to be part of the process, if they want to have any influence. That is not to say everything will be agreed. This will not happen, it never does. However, mapping and finding the gaps in the service is vitally important. That is what we did in the area of mental health and we need to do it here too. We cannot continue to allow the resource that is in place to go unused. It is not enough, but the resource I mean is the allied professionals I just named. I do not say this in a negative or disingenuous way. We cannot allow all those people to remain within institutions and only delivering service in those institutions. We must have a more holistic approach and must ensure that children who have a difficulty about going into particular areas are accommodated. I very clearly heard the woman the Deputy mentioned. This is a solvable problem, however, and we need to look at solutions. This is about delivering a better service to more children, and also to those many young adults who are still receiving the service. That would be the aim but it is not an overnight project and will take time. I urge people to become engaged with the process.

I genuinely mean that, because I know her track record in this area. It is very welcome that she has acknowledged today in the Chamber that this project cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis. That is a big fear people have, as the Minister of State will know from the meeting. I completely agree we must map out the services we need in order to identify the gaps that must be filled. The Minister of State rightly stated there cannot be a situation where people who need services do not receive them. Everybody is entitled to them and should receive them. The mapping process will identify the individuals in question and resources will have to be put in place. The big fear, however, was about doing the work on a cost-neutral basis. If gaps are being identified which will then have to be plugged with resources, and this is being attempted on a cost-neutral basis, it is easy to understand the fear on the part of parents whose children are attending specialist schools. Their big fear is that in moving to the geographical model services will be taken from some individuals in order to plug the gaps in other areas. The Minister of State's acknowledgment today that perhaps this cannot be done on a cost-neutral basis is a positive step and I am sure if parents heard it they would feel there is an understanding of their fears. If we can achieve this, which is not easy in the circumstances we face with the public finances, perhaps we can have a situation where we do not take from one area that is working well in order to try to compensate another area where there are gaps.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	717	I will be brief. I approach everything on the basis that people come to the table with the very best intentions. I have always done that and that is how I will continue. Equally, when I am dealing with any situation I ask myself what I would do in that circumstance. I know if I had a child who was receiving a very good service and there was a possibility that service might move to a different location, I would be very nervous about all of that. I understand this, I really do. What we need to look at is how to improve the service. It is not about taking from Peter to pay Paul, which never works: neither Peter nor Paul is happy. We really need to start improving the service. We have used a model which I am reluctant to mention because I know it could be misinterpreted and I do not mean it in that way. The model we used in the area of mental health, whereby we mapped what was necessary for delivering the service in the community, is a good one and we must consider it. The needs will be different in the area of disability and we understand that. Nevertheless that type of mapping process works. It looks at where gaps exist and what is necessary to ensure they are filled, not by robbing Peter to pay Paul but by taking a look at the kind of enhanced budget we need. This may be a separate budget. In mental health, we used developmental money rather than a centralised budget. That is the direction we need to take and we must look at it. That answer will not satisfy the parents we met in Ballincollig - at this time. However, if we have a view of where we want to get to and if there is an incremental plan of how to get there, we could go on this journey together.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	718	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. According to ASH Ireland, the prevalence of smoking in this country stands somewhere between 26% and 29%. While the position in this regard is better than it was a generation ago, when nearly half of the population smoked, the figure remains high, particularly in comparison to that in places such as California where only 11% of the population smoke, or Norway where the figure is 17%. Smoking must be one of the greatest causes of health problems, with most smokers admitting that they wish they had never begun in the first instance. Smoking is an extremely difficult addiction to overcome and a very expensive habit. We have made great strides in reducing the level of smoking, having banned it in so many public places. It is well known, however, that the cost of nicotine replacement therapies such as gum, patches and the newer artificial cigarettes is a factor in ensuring some people continue to smoke. They are very expensive, particularly in comparison to the prices paid by our friends north of the Border and throughout the United Kingdom. A major factor in the difference in price is that the British Government has introduced a special VAT of just 5% for these therapies. In Ireland, however, we charge a rate of 23%. This is what gives rise to the significant price differential between Ireland and the United Kingdom. If we could follow the example of the United Kingdom and introduce a similar rate here, the knock-on effects for smokers and the Exchequer would be tremendous. Over 5,500 people die each year as a result of smoking-related illnesses. It is estimated that we spend close to €1.5 billion in treating these illnesses. While a reduction in VAT might result in a small shortfall for Revenue, we should consider the savings to be made in the long term if the beleaguered Department of Health were obliged to deal with fewer smoking-related illnesses. We must do everything possible to reduce the startling statistics for smoking. We can only bring about such a reduction if we help people to give up smoking, while also deterring young people from taking up the habit. Having nicotine replacement therapies available at a reasonable price would definitely assist those trying to beat the addiction.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	719	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, to which I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. I welcome the opportunity to outline the position on the question of the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches posed by the Deputy. I wish to explain that, when considering the VAT system and the VAT treatment of any product or service, the VAT rating of goods and services is governed by the requirements of the EU VAT directive with which Irish VAT law must comply. In this regard, it may be useful to remind the House of the structure of Ireland's VAT regime. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland operates a number of VAT rates. The standard VAT rate of 23% applies to the majority of goods and services, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment, CDs and DVDs. There is also a reduced rate of 13.5% which applies mainly to fuel used for heat or light, construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance. A second reduced rate of 9%, introduced as part of the jobs initiative, applies mainly to tourism-related services, including hotel and holiday accommodation, restaurant services and some entertainment services. The zero rate of VAT generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes and oral medicines. As the Deputy correctly pointed out, nicotine replacement patches are subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%. Unlike other nicotine products such as inhalers, tablets and chewing gum which are categorised as oral medicines and which thereby qualify for the zero-rate of VAT, nicotine replacement patches are not considered to be oral medicines and are, therefore, correctly subject to the standard rate of VAT of 23%. However, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that member states have the option, under Annex lll of the EU VAT directive, of applying a reduced rate of VAT to pharmaceutical products of a kind normally used for health care, for the prevention of illnesses and medical treatment purposes. In this regard, since nicotine replacement patches could be considered to meet such criteria, Ireland would have the option of applying a reduced rate to such products. However, constraints imposed by the VAT directive on the number of reduced VAT rates which a member state may operate at any one time would not allow for the possibility of a special reduced VAT rate of 5% to match, as suggested by the Deputy, that which applies in the United Kingdom. Article 98 of the directive provides that member states may apply either one or two reduced rates to the goods and services listed in Annex lll. The introduction of a third reduced VAT rate would, therefore, not be possible under EU VAT rules. Accordingly, any reduction in the VAT rate on nicotine replacement patches would have to be considered in the context of the existing 9% and 13.5% reduced rates. A proposal to reduce the VAT rate applying to any good or service raises a number of issues. The Deputy will not be surprised if I emphasise the need to maintain VAT revenues and also the need to ensure losses to the Exchequer in these difficult economic times are avoided. Notwithstanding the potential health benefits which may accrue from the use of nicotine replacement patches, losses in one area must be balanced by savings or increased taxes in others. The issue of the degree to which the consumer might benefit from a reduction in VAT on nicotine replacement patches also arises. In this regard, there is, unfortunately, no guarantee that moving standard-rated products to a reduced rate of VAT would necessarily be reflected in full in the retail prices charged to consumers. Any dilution of the potential benefit to the consumer would obviously be a major concern and effectively negate the promotion of the use of nicotine patch technology. In the context of the imbalance of price between Ireland and the United Kingdom to which the Deputy refers, cross-Border shopping studies indicate that fluctuations in the exchange rate between sterling and the euro represent the most significant influence on price. In this respect, the current exchange rate between sterling and the euro should provide less incentive for people to shop outside the State. The report of the implications of cross-Border shopping which was undertaken on behalf of the Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Statistics Office notes that the main causes of price differentials between goods in Northern Ireland and the Republic are operating costs, profit margin or mark-up, taxes and the exchange rate between sterling and the euro. While variations in VAT rates widened some price differentials, their impact remained small compared to the significance of the change in the exchange rate. I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I hope I have clarified the position on the VAT treatment of nicotine replacement patches and the situation regarding the possibilities available under the EU VAT directive.

I remain of the view that this is an area in which we should do a great deal more work, particularly as the benefits for Ireland and other member states would be very significant. It is stated one's health is one's wealth. If we can help people to stop smoking, we will have done a great deed. Nicotine replacement therapies are sold from behind the counter in Ireland, whereas in the United Kingdom and most other countries they are sold off the shelf. They are also sold exclusively by chemist shops in this country, but elsewhere one can purchase them from a wide variety of outlets, which makes matters much easier for those who want to quit. I am determined to pursue this significant issue which has major implications for people's health and the Exchequer. We must do everything in our power to help people stop smoking, particularly as the habit is so closely associated with the lower socioeconomic classes. In the case of a person in receipt of a benefit payment of €188 per week and who smokes 20 cigarettes a day - most people smoke more at weekends - one can calculate that he or she spends €60 to €70 a week on tobacco, which is a significant amount of money. If we put in place a task force to assist people on benefits to quit the habit, this would go a long way towards helping such individuals rebalance their budgets rather than watching their money go up in smoke.

It may be possible to have nicotine patches on open display to make them more available to the consumer. The cost of 20 cigarettes is the best part of €70 a week. This is a major expenditure for people on low incomes. More than 5,500 people die in this country every year from smoking related diseases. The consumption of cigarettes is detrimental to people's health. I refer to the issue of the illegal importation of tobacco products. Cigarettes are being sold door to door. This is illicit tobacco and the quality is dubious. Any tobacco is bad but this illicit tobacco is substandard and the quality is even worse. The Minister for Finance referred to the possibility of a VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% on nicotine replacement patches. I suggest the Deputy could pursue this issue with him. I am certain a self-financing mechanism would benefit the State and the health of the population. I agree with the Deputy that these products should be more available.

Dublin City Council figures show that last year, 16,600 families and individuals were on its housing waiting list, with 7,538 on the transfer list. A total of 32% of applicants were waiting more than five years, with 2,544 waiting more than seven years. I describe these figures as deeply damaging to the credibility of Dublin City Council and the Government. In addition, Fingal County Council confirmed to me that 9,082 families and individuals were waiting for housing on its council housing list. When Members of this House are able to retire to our comfortable homes or lodgings after long days in the Dáil, 80 to 90 people will be sleeping on the streets of this city. They will sleep outside on this very night as they have done over recent bitter November nights. It is unacceptable and disgraceful. Like other Members I receive many phone calls and e-mails from constituents. I meet many of them at my weekly information clinics who are in dire straits with regard to housing. They describe very difficult home circumstances. They may be on a housing waiting list for anything from five to 13 years. A typical example is a young woman with three children who has been living for the past five or six years in very cramped conditions with her adult siblings and her parents in a modest two-bedroom house. A few weeks ago I asked the Taoiseach whether a social housing investment programme would be implemented in 2012. I have studied budget 2013 as best I can but I have not found any evidence of any serious intent on the part of this Government to address this issue. I estimate that perhaps only a few dozen individuals and households were rehoused in the past year in my constituency out of the 4,000 on the Dublin North-Central housing list. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to tackling the issue but it is impossible for any progress to be made unless proper funding is allocated to kick-start the social housing programme. This would also have a beneficial effect on the construction industry. I have spoken about the appalling treatment of citizens who have been left on the waiting list, in some cases for up to 15 years. I have long urged Dublin City Council to move away from its historic points-based, priority-based housing list system to a system based on time on the list, as used in Fingal County Council. I am a former Dublin City Council councillor. The council last week decided to move to the system of time on the list, which is a fair and transparent system. It is a case of first come, first served. It now awaits the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to sign the regulation. When will he sign that regulation? Under the Fianna Fáil regime led by Ahern and Cowen, the failure of local authorities to provide social housing meant a massive growth in the private rental sector. In the past five years since 2007, almost €3 billion has been expended on rent supplement allowances. This money has gone into the pockets of private landlords. Ordinary constituents wonder why that money was not used to fund a housing programme. When will the promised housing Bill come before the House? I refer in particular to provisions in respect of the administration of voluntary housing bodies. My constituency has organisations such as NABCO, Iveagh Trust, Respond and Clúid. There is no legislation governing estate management and tenancy and it is urgently needed. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave two deadlines - the first Sunday in September and then a further ten days - to the developers, builders, auctioneers, insurance companies in respect of the pyrite disaster. He keeps issuing deadlines but when will he take action? When will he decide to levy the industry which did those terrible things to households? People are upset that they are expected to pay a housing tax - which the House will discuss tomorrow - on houses which are worthless because they need to be remediated. I ask the Minister of State to bring these points to the attention of the Minister. On a final point, I ask the Minister of State to ask if the Minister will join us next Monday at 7.30 p.m. at Priory Hall for a candlelight vigil. Those families - a total of 250 people - are facing a second Christmas out of their homes at Priory Hall. I am sure they would be delighted to see him at the vigil next Monday night at Priory Hall.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	724	I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue. I may not have the comprehensive reply he wants but I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hogan. The current economic crisis is severely testing the capacity of the State to meet social housing need. Financial considerations mean local authorities are effectively no longer engaged in large-scale housing stock construction programmes at the very time when demand for housing services is at its greatest. The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, sets out a new approach for housing provision that recognises these key unfortunate realities. It is specifically predicated on a tenure-neutral approach that focuses on enabling households to access the housing solution that best suited to their needs at a point in time. While home ownership is still a very valid aspiration for a majority of households, it is no longer the acme of all tenure options. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with the housing authorities and with not-for-profit approved housing bodies, is engaging in a range of innovative and flexible housing solutions to meet housing need in general, and homelessness in particular. I acknowledge the Deputy's campaigning work on behalf of the homeless I sympathise with the fact that up to 80 people are sleeping on the streets of Dublin tonight. I cannot even imagine what it must be like on such a cold evening. I appreciate the Deputy's point about homelessness. The Department's approach to homelessness is to focus on providing people with a home where they can live as full and valued members of society.That is why Government policy in this area is moving to a housing-led approach rather than the traditional model that places hostel or shelter-type accommodation at the centre of accommodation provision. This change will take time to implement, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is committed to seeing it through. People deserve the dignity of a home. We must obviously bear in mind the financial constraints. Early in the new year, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be issuing a policy statement on homelessness. This will indicate what we expect from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness. The Minister of State has sought to put in place real solutions for people who find themselves without a home. Investment of nearly €50 million has been provided by central and local government in the provision of homelessness services in 2012. With regard to wider demand for social housing, the Government's focus is on optimising the delivery of social housing for the resources invested. To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs. The social housing capital budget has had to be reduced from €1.535 billion in 2008 to just over €333.7 million this year - this is a considerable reduction - and the financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to large capital-funded construction programmes. Nevertheless, the Minister of State is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs across the country through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing. Delivery is being significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the rental accommodation scheme and leasing, but the Minister of State is also developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. In spite of these challenging circumstances, a tentative projection of 4,000 housing units is anticipated for 2012. The Minister of State will continue to target available resources to ensure the critical housing needs of the most vulnerable sectors of our society are addressed. Precise data are critical in this regard, which is why the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will in 2013 carry out a full housing-needs assessment, the first such assessment to be carried out under the 2009 housing Act. This will give a comprehensive picture of real need and help to direct scarce resources to best effect. I will pass on Deputy Broughan's concerns on Priory Hall to the Minister, Deputy Hogan.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	725	I warmly welcome that because the householders of Priory Hall are anxiously awaiting the recommendation of Mr. Justice Finnegan. Those with pyrite damaged homes are waiting to know whether the Government will put in place a facility regarding the new house tax, which is having an impact on them, and whether the deadline has been reached. The current social housing capital budget is €333.7 million, a very disappointing sum. The Government is supposed to be getting €400 million plus for the 4G communications auction. Could at least part of this not be hypothecated to address the awful housing problem? Might this be considered? I understand we are not going to make the promissory note payment at the end of March. We slotted into the Estimates for the medium term approximately €5 billion between interest and capital repayments. Are there not more areas in the kitty that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be examining to kick-start the sector and get all the unemployed construction workers back onto the sites? It is shocking that 80 to 90 people might be sleeping out tonight. There was a recent tragic death involving a homeless person in Bray. This urgent issue needs to be addressed in the coming days. When will the housing Bill be introduced? With regard to the rent-to-buy and rental accommodation schemes, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, mentioned various initiatives. Do the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, intend to do something more dramatic regarding plans for long-term rental? Has the Minister of State given any consideration to allowing local authorities themselves to engage in housing construction like the voluntary bodies by establishing their own construction and housing-management companies? It would involve emulating what Clúid, NABCO and other bodies have done. Thus, local authorities, such as Sligo county and city councils, could take the initiative rather than wait for individuals in the community to do so.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	726	The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is very far-reaching in his thinking. The biggest shake-up in local government in 100 years has taken place under his watch. This involves a considerable change of mindset. Bearing in mind the limited budget and very scarce resources, I am quite certain value for money will be achieved in respect of the buy-to-let and rental accommodation schemes.

It is obviously a matter for the Minister for Finance to deal with the money allocated for the 4G communications auction. I will raise the timeline for the legislation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I note what the Deputy said and the Minister will revert to him. With regard to homelessness and people sleeping out, we are very fortunate that there are some fantastic services providing short-term solutions. Members of the voluntary sector are bringing people into shelters in the city every night. I hope sincerely that the homeless will be facilitated in every way possible. Members of the Garda Síochána are identifying people. It is very important that, in the short term, the homeless must be facilitated, especially in this very difficult climate. This is only a short-term solution, not a long-term one.

We are taking a series of steps on a number of levels to prepare for this. State agencies, the Department and companies are working together to restore new markets in areas such as Asia, the Middle East, Russia and Africa. We are also developing a common brand, Origin Green, across the food industry generally. This is about differentiating Irish food from food produced in competitor countries. Essentially, it is a sustainability claim backed up by data that are internationally accredited in respect of how food is produced in Ireland. Part of building that brand requires a sustainability and quality programme for primary producers of dairy projects. This is why, in last year's budget, I announced that I wanted to see the rolling out of a quality or sustainability programme among the 18,000 dairy farmers in the country to ensure we could stand over our collective dairy industry and say we produce milk to a certain standard. This will not be some kind of inspection-based witch-hunt of farmers; it will be quite the opposite. We will roll out the programme in the same way that the carbon-footprinting programme has been rolled out for the beef sector. By the end of this year, 32,000 beef farms across Ireland will be carbon-footprinted. When we sell a steak, not only will we be able to put on the label the traceability claim indicating the farmyard from where it came, we will also be able to tell buyers the carbon footprint of the animal that produced it.We want to provide similar sustainability claims for dairy production in Ireland. Bord Bia is working with all the interested parties and farming organisations to ensure we get buy in from farmers and that we insulate the Irish dairy industry from price volatility in the future on the basis of quality and the data we collect which can prove sustainability.

In his preamble to the points he made about the proposed scheme, he said the background to this is Food Harvest 2020 and the projected increase in diary production in Ireland. I understand Teagasc has prepared expansion plans for the dairy industry and the plans indicate it will be expensive to expand. This industry, by its nature, is capital intensive and there is a low margin return on the money invested in it. When the inevitable price volatility that will arise for the dairy sector is injected into the mix, any proposal that will increase costs for the farmer, or a combination of farmers in partnership arrangements, is dangerous territory to approach. Is the model of the proposed scheme a template taken from somewhere else? Has it been modelled on a template in some other jurisdiction across the Community? For instance, will the authorities north of the Border have a parallel scheme running alongside our proposed scheme? The core question is the additional cost that will be imposed on farmers who will be stretched financially to meet the expansion objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020. 
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	731	The best way farmers can insulate themselves from the price volatility that will happen in the future is to ensure Irish product get differentiated from other product. Let us not forget that more than 85% of all the milk we produce is exported in various forms, be it infant formula, skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, cheese, yoghurts and all the other products in which milk is an ingredient. If we are to be able to demand a higher price for our product in the future, which we will need to do, and move away from being a commodity producer of volume to being a quality producer of volume, targeting the top 10% price area in the new markets we are exploring, we have to be able to stand over the way in which our food is produced. The sustainability and quality programme will not cost farmers a great deal of money, in fact it will help them to run their businesses more efficiently. If a farmer is using less water, has more feed conversion efficiency and more efficient grazing management, his business will be more efficient and sustainable. The combination of those two factors will improve the standard of dairy farming in Ireland, which will be beneficial for everybody. In the context of the capital investment farmers have to make, we will make more than €10 million available to dairy farmers next year in the form of the TAM scheme, which is half of the overall scheme as such, to help them with the costs of expansion, growth and upgrading their equipment.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Environmental sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the marketplace for many multinational dairy and food operators, many of which now have sustainability as a core part of their corporate strategies. During my trade missions to China and the US in 2012 it was clear that the sustainability and quality messages have a strong resonance both with potential customers for Irish food products and with potential investors in the Irish agri food sector.  Developing a unique selling point for Irish food products is a critically important element of the national strategy for the development of the sector. It is particularly relevant in the dairy sector where we will need to maximise market returns for significantly increased production in competitive markets worldwide. Ireland is well placed to develop a national brand image based on a reputation for high quality dairy products, and on its mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, grass based production and an already positive green image. In that context, earlier this year, Bord Bia launched its “Origin Green” programme, which establishes a framework within which Irish food companies can have their green credentials independently measured. This will be a critically important element in the development of the Irish food sector in the coming years and its promotion on international markets. The key is to build independently verifiable metrics, which can be used in the marketplace, around Ireland’s already positive green image.  It is equally important to develop an independently accredited sustainability and quality programme at farm level for the dairy sector as part of that overall strategy to enable the sector point to verifiable attributes in maintaining and expanding its market share. There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability and to improve hygiene and other quality practices on farm, and those needed to reduce the costs of production at farm level and improve profitability.  In that context, and following extensive consultations with stakeholders in the first half of 2012, I announced in June that Bord Bia would begin detailed work on the development of a national sustainability and quality programme for the dairy sector to be used as a key element in marketing and promotional efforts on international markets. The programme will provide an independently accredited framework for operating best practice quality and sustainability principles on Irish dairy farms, and an objective and uniform mechanism for measuring compliance with these principles. It will also provide a vehicle for encouraging continuous improvement in production standards on Irish farms, underpin the marketing of Irish dairy products internationally and provide additional assurance for potential investors in Ireland.  Stakeholders are currently engaged in detailed technical discussions on the development of the programme, under the aegis of a technical advisory group convened by Bord Bia to progress the issue, and I hope it can be finalised in the near future.

There has been some criticism since the announcement of the budget that we have targeted certain schemes unfairly and I want to give the Deputy the rationale for why we did what we did. I will deal with the beef sector first.  For the past five years we have had a suckler cow welfare scheme which has been a popular and extremely good scheme. It has significantly improved the welfare standards within the suckler herd and it has provided very valuable data around breeding programmes and fertility within herds to Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is very useful for planning for the future, breeding programmes and so on. That was a five year scheme and this is the fifth year of it. It has come to an end. I had signalled that I would not be able to continue the suckler cow welfare scheme indefinitely into the future because we do not have the money to do it and it has come to the end of its five year term. I would have had to have put a new scheme in place and get approval from Brussels for that. Instead we decided to put in place a smaller, more targeted scheme to replace the suckler scheme for the moment, which will cost us approximately €10 million a year and which will pay farmers €20 rather than €40 an animal. We are asking them to continue to supply the kind of data on breeding and fertility they previously would have been providing to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF. We are asking new entrants also to provide that data for that money. It is important to say in terms of the beef sector, because it is misunderstood, that next year we will spend almost as much on the beef sector as we spent this year. This year we will spend €25 million on the suckler cow welfare scheme in addition to approximately €2 million connected to beef discussion groups which started half way through the year. Next year we will spend €10 million on this new scheme. We will spend €10 million on the existing suckler cow welfare scheme where the payments will be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of the year, and we will spend €5 million on beef discussion groups on this sector next year. That is €25 million that will be spent on suckler beef next year which is not a significant difference from what was spent on that sector this year, although I accept the make-up and design of those payments are different. I will address one or two of the other sectors related to the sheep sector and DAS payments when I get an opportunity to do so later.

He is aware that farm incomes have fallen by 22% up to November of this year. That is an average payment of approximately €18,000 which is well below the industrial wage. I am sure he is also aware of the plight of the weaker farmer, which includes farmers in the suckler welfare scheme, those on previous REP schemes and so forth, and the fact that such schemes were instrumental to the viability of that type of farming. Notwithstanding the tremendous work regarding the provision of data and so forth, the suckler scheme has had a huge impact on the quality of calves being born and in terms of the finished product, and everybody benefited as a result. It is not the remit of the Minister's Department, but the farm assist scheme has been cut by approximately €8 million. The farmers in that scheme are the most marginal and they are struggling to survive and care for their families. These cuts will have a detrimental effect on that type of farming in particular because one will find that the farmers in the suckler welfare scheme and some people involved in sheep farming are also dependent on farm assist. While the Minister might try to make up that loss another way, perhaps by compensating for the situation in regard the suckler welfare scheme, the farm assist being cut as well will make it almost impossible for these type of farmers to survive.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	734	There is a genuine concern about ensuring that farmers on relatively small farms in very disadvantaged areas are provided with enough support to keep them on the land. That is the reason, in terms of the savings we must make in the disadvantaged areas scheme, we have excluded farmers in mountainous regions from any of those savings to ensure nobody farming in a mountainous area - that is 32,000 out of the 100,000 - will face any reduction in their incomes. Regarding the low land disadvantaged area farmers, instead of reducing the rate for everybody, we have reduced the eligible hectarage for people to again protect smaller farmers. In other words, instead of claiming the payment on 34 hectares as a maximum it will be claimed on 30 hectares as a maximum. I have tried to prioritise the most disadvantaged farmers, that is, the people on the mountains and the smaller farmers within the disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, in lowland areas. A total of 73% of people in disadvantaged areas will be unaffected by the reductions and the remainder will see a reduction of an average of about 11% but those decisions were made to protect those with holdings and the most disadvantaged people within DAS areas. The same applies to the suckler scheme. Those who apply for the new suckler scheme in terms of the data transfer scheme will automatically get €20 per cow for the first 20 cows.The average size of a suckler herd is 16 cows while the average size of a suckler herd in the suckler cow welfare scheme is 18 cows. We are trying to prioritise smaller farmers. If we have moneys left over after that, then we will give it to the farmers who have more than 20 cows. I believe there will be some money left over to give top-up payments to farmers with 30 to 40 suckler cows. This was the third year of the three-year sheep grasslands scheme. We have decided to continue with the scheme, which will be paid for by unspent moneys under pillar 1. While we have reduced the cost of it from €18 million to €14 million, we have made up for that by introducing a discussion group, similar to the ones that have worked so well for the dairy sector, which will bring farmers together to discuss how they can improve their businesses and make more money in the marketplace. We will spend €3 million on these discussion groups next year. The total spend on the sheep sector next year will be more or less the same as this year's. I have worked hard to achieve this, as I see the sheep sector as a vulnerable area.

Dunmore East fishery harbour centre is one of the six designated fishery harbour centres which are owned, managed and maintained by my Department and, as such, it receives funding annually on foot of the programme. My Department continues to support the harbour's development with funding provided for maintenance, development and upgrading works each year. Indeed, expenditure under the programme for Dunmore East since 2007 has been in the order of €4 million. This is in recognition of the valuable contribution the harbour makes to the fishing industry as well as the local community in terms of the support the harbour infrastructure provides to the development of the tourism industry and the local economy generally. Dunmore East fishery harbour centre provides a dedicated and essential service to our fishing fleet. Both local and visiting fishing vessels, including vessels of significant dimensions, avail of the harbour facilities at Dunmore East. I am happy to report the investment in Dunmore East fishery harbour centre in recent years is bearing fruit. Indeed, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority's records indicate a year-on-year increase in fish landings in recent years. My Department's officials host a harbour users' forum regularly and meet with local stakeholders and harbour users. This forum provides a platform for harbour users to air their views and gives my officials an opportunity to hear at first hand the concerns and suggestions of the people using the harbour facilities. As recently as July of this year, the Dunmore East tourism group, which plays an active part in the harbour users' group, formally complimented both the appearance of the harbour and the good work being done there by my Department. The need for dredging works at the harbour has been recognised by my Department. Reports commissioned have indicated that 80% of the harbour sediment contains tributyltin, TBT. Unfortunately, the cost associated with the disposal of dredge is approximately €5 million. This is a figure we cannot afford immediately but I am conscious of the need to dredge the harbour. We are examining the best way of dealing with this as safely as we can given our budgetary constraints. The total harbours budget this year was €7 million and the cost of cleaning Dunmore East is €5 million. The Deputy can understand the difficulties I have.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
This represents a significant expenditure in the current economic environment and I can confirm that my Department's engineering division has engaged consultants to examine and report on a number of alternative options in terms of the structuring of the works and the outlay involved. I expect to have the report in early 2013 and will assess at that stage how best to proceed. Future investment at Dunmore East and the five other fishery harbour centres will of course be considered each year in the context of available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities. In early 2013, I expect to be in a position to identify projects for inclusion under the 2013 fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure capital development programme at each of the six fishery harbour centres.

Over the past decade, however, this long-established fishing industry has been under threat from restrictions designed to protect stocks. The local fishermen's co-operative is struggling enormously with EU fish quota restrictions, an aging fishing fleet and poor fish prices caused by low demand due to the recession. As fishing vessels become more technologically demanding, additional pressure has been put on resources and infrastructure. Reduced catches put pressure on employment in the processing sector. Several fish factories have already closed in Dunmore East over the past four years. Dunmore East Harbour is suffering from inadequate infrastructure to address its potential needs. No dredging of the harbour has taken place for 17 years. Consequently, larger vessels cannot access the harbour. Silting has reduced the depth of the approach under the synchrolift. Despite the fact that it has a lifting capacity of 200 tonnes, it is only suitable for vessels with a maximum draft of about nine feet. Hence, many vessels have to divert to Cork or Howth for docking. This poor access has had a devastating impact on the local fishing fleet. Since the recession hit, several hotels and restaurants in Dunmore East have closed. There is a significant scarcity of work and little or no investment in local industry. It is well recognised that the average income in the fishing village is below the national average. The local community has suffered significantly in the past several years, with a 12% decline in population. Without a properly functioning harbour, we may as well close down Dunmore East.

Fish landings at Dunmore East are actually increasing every year. Quotas are significantly up this year and it is my job to negotiate another good deal on the quotas next week. The stocks of cod, haddock, whiting and herring in the Celtic Sea are all up. It is not as bad as some people make out. I agree there is a significant problem in the harbour and it needs to be dredged. I will do it when I can afford to. In the meantime, we will have to put a plan in place to do what we can do.

These preparations have been completed this year in an impressive manner. There has been much talk about getting the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy done during the Irish EU Presidency. I am equally focused on the Common Fisheries Policy. We want to get a deal for all countries but one that will also shape policy to ensure the Irish industry can survive and grow. One of the key issues under discussion is how we deal with discards.At the moment in many of our fisheries up to 40% or 50% of the fish caught are being dumped over the side, dead. They are either juvenile fish or in some cases adult fish. We need and we will find solutions to that and I hope the industry will work with me in the change process. We are moving towards what is termed maximum sustainable yield in how we determine quotas each year. The idea is that there is a set formula now based on data collection and linked to total allowable catch which can measure what a fish species can take in terms of the amount of fish caught each year to ensure that the stocks can survive and grow. We are trying to apply maximum sustainable yield, MSY, calculations to as many of the stocks as we can and to have enough data to do that by 2015. We are trying to apply it to all the stocks with sufficient data by 2020. That is part of the programme. The other issue relates to regionalisation of decision making. This is something we are supportive of because we are keen to see countries fishing in Irish waters making decisions on the management of stocks in Irish waters rather than others, but we also want the protection of the Commission to ensure that Ireland does not get outvoted or outnumbered in a regionalisation structure on decision making. For example, we want to avoid a scenario whereby the French and Spanish could gang up on Ireland and make decisions on fish stocks in Irish waters. That would be unacceptable. Only when there is a unanimous decision on a regionalised decision-making process will we support it. Otherwise we want to be able to go back to the Commission, which is essentially there to support small nations. The challenge is to find common ground with the European Parliament. I will spend a good deal of time in Brussels talking to people in the European Parliament about how to ensure that the Council, which is represented by Ministers, and the European Parliament can come together in a co-decision process to find a compromise position on the future of the fishing industry and to try to get that job done by the end of June next year. I believe it will be possible to do it but it will be demanding.

I imagine he will have the fishermen and the fishery organisations in tow. It is important to the 11,000 people employed in the fishing industry around the country that the Common Fisheries Policy review leans towards Irish fishermen. They believe that in the past they have not got the best possible deals. Does the Minister believe he will be in a position to conclude the review during the term of the Irish EU Council Presidency? The Minister has been pursuing the issue of discards, among other issues, since he came to the Ministry. Does he have any other countries on board supporting him on the issue of discards? In the area of regionalisation one size does not fit all for Irish fishermen but it is an important issue on the agenda.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	754	We worked hard during the Danish EU Council Presidency, which was before the current Cypriot Presidency, to get a Common Position on discards by the end of the Presidency, which was the end of June this year. There is a basic agreement in principle on how to address discards. However, dealing with the pelagic sector is different from dealing with the whitefish sector and there is a recognition of this, in particular in the whitefish sector, in which there are mixed fisheries. For example, off the south coast of Ireland at Dunmore East if one is catching cod, one is also likely to catch haddock and whiting in the same net. When adult fish species are the same size and a fisherman has a quota to catch two types but not the third, what does he do when he catches all three in the one net? These are complex problems that we must try to solve through more technical measures and more targeted fishing gear. It is one thing to deal with the juvenile fish issue. One can deal with it through measures such as mesh size to allow smaller fish to escape, but in mixed fisheries where one is likely to catch multiple species in the one net because the fish are roughly the same size there are complex problems relating to the management of discards. We are trying to find flexible ways of doing that, minimising discards and ultimately eliminating them altogether. I believe we will be able to do that. It will be possible to do this before June but it will be challenging because there are deep divisions on some of these issues between member states, some of which are driven by the sustainability arguments while others are driven by the fishing industry. I maintain that they have a common interest and it will be our job during the Irish Presidency to try to bring the two sides together and to agree compromise positions.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	755	I am pleased that the Deputy has asked this question because we discussed it some weeks ago. I am pleased that I have managed to bring the issue forward since that discussion. I wish to make clear at the outset that my reply relates to the public trust set up in 1919 under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts. To avoid confusion, my Department refers to it as the Castlerea Public Trust because there is another private trust bordering the trust in Castlerea. The Castlerea Public Trust land is registered on folio No. 13684 County Roscommon in the names of the trustees. Public trusts vest the trust land in the trustees and provide that day-to-day operational matters relating to the public trust are dealt with by the trustees, appointed from time to time. As Minister, I retain certain residual powers, mainly set out in section 30 of the Land Act 1950. These powers are to appoint the trustees; to alter or amend the terms of the trust; to agree to proposals from the trustees regarding disposal in whole or in part of the trust; and revocation of the trust if it is not being used for its intended purposes. Castlerea Public Trust was originally created as a cow park trust, where local landless people could graze a cow. With the passage of time as Castlerea town has developed, part of the trust lands close to Market Square have been used by local people for recreational purposes and there are several paths and walkways traversing the trust lands. As Minister, I am solely empowered to appoint trustees to these Land Act trusts. The existing trustees notify my Department when any appointments are necessary and they also nominate names of persons suitable and willing to act as trustees.

It is important that the replacement trustees are nominated by and acceptable to existing trustees to ensure the harmonious work of the trust. This is especially important in Castlerea because at present the people who are the trustees of the Castlerea Public Trust lands are also trustees of the contiguous private trust lands. In the case of Castlerea Public Trust, new trustee nominations were recently submitted to me. I have not as yet appointed these nominated parties because I believe it is necessary for the existing trustees to carry out a comprehensive review of the operation of the trust and address in particular the need to modernise the use of the trust from mainly pasturage to accommodate general recreational use. When this review has been completed, I will consider the nomination and replacement of trustees, who may bring additional community value and reflect any new direction established for the use of the trust lands. This will entail the trustees liaising with community leaders for the ongoing development, preservation and increased community use of the important local amenity. It is my policy generally with Land Act trusts that where agreement can be reached locally, ownership of the trust lands should be transferred to a community company or a co-operative representative of local communities. I endeavour to seek consensus not confrontation in carrying through such a transfer. I am mindful of the fact that the trustees in Castlerea and their predecessors in title have preserved and developed this trust since 1919 as a significant amenity for the area and I hope to be able to move this process forward in a positive way.

I hope I can do likewise for this Government. The former Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, stated in this House: "The ... trust does not appear to be answerable to anybody, is not elected, refuses to discuss the business of the town demesne with any local representative group". That was possibly the first time that the former Minister of State chimed with the people of Castlerea. In 2005, 1,300 people wrote to the then Minister with responsibility for agriculture asking her to revoke the trust. While she did not do so, she did not appoint any new trustees. This has led to the situation whereby there are now only five trustees remaining. If that number falls below five, it will not be possible to obtain a quorum for a meeting, at which point action will have to be taken. When I heard that an attempt had been made to appoint new trustees, I contacted the Minister whom I thank for taking the time to speak to me on what I know was a busy day for him. More people have now written to the Minister. I understand some 1,300 people have done so and that there are a further 280 letters on the way to the Minister asking him not to appoint new members to the trust, to let it fall and, if needs be, to use his powers to revoke the trust. When the Minister's officials last visited the trust, they outlined the future of the cow park trust in view of the fact that the main objective of the original trust had now ceased. They also informed it of the 1,300 letters received by the Minister, which had been organised by then Councillor Flanagan, and said that as a public official the Minister could not ignore them.

It relates to whether we should be setting ceilings on future single farm payments. Before considering whether we should be setting caps on single farm payments, we first need to know that we have the capacity to do so. I have been supportive of the Commissioner's proposals to cap single farm payments. This would result in a reduction in payment on amounts in excess of €150,000. I would like to see the cap set lower than €150,000. I have stated that I would have no difficulty with a cap on payments of approximately €100,000. I recognise that we must find a common solution across the European Union which all countries can accept and live with. In my view, a number of the larger powerful countries, such as, for example, Germany and Britain, will not accept a cap on single farm payments because they have large landowners who are big commercial food producers who are receiving large payments and they want to see that continue. Ireland is in a different situation. I need to ensure the flexibility countries are given in relation to the capping issue suits Ireland. Once a final deal is done and, if we have the capacity on a voluntary basis, country by country, to be able to set caps on single farm payments, we can then have this discussion and try to get this right. I do not have a problem with that in principle but we need to be careful not to push the cap too low because we have large commercial farmers we need to support. We will have an opportunity at a later stage, when we know the options, to be able to debate and discuss this issue and then make the most informed decision.

There appears to be some doubt about what that figure will be. Will we be dealing with a reduced provision in 2013 or is it likely the budgetary situation will deteriorate with the passage of time? The envelope available for distribution to primary producers in Ireland will be determined by the budgetary position. There are various proposals floating around concerning the multi-annual financial framework for 2014 to 2020 - the long-term budget plan. The danger in this context is that provision for CAP funding may well be reduced and that the Irish envelope will suffer as a result. Perhaps the Minister would appraise the House of the up-to-date position.

The first concerns negotiations on the overall budget, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, as referred to by the Deputy. We failed collectively last month as a European Union to get agreement on the MFF. This budget is for seven years and is worth more than €1 trillion. There was a wide variation in what countries wanted in terms of the levels of reduction or increases to that budget. For example, Britain wanted cuts of up to €200 billion. President Van Rompuy proposed cuts of approximately €80 billion. As the negotiations proceeded, the different budget lines within the budget were being debated in terms of which might take cuts and which might not. There are three big budget lines. CAP represents approximately 38 to 40% of the budget. Cohesion Funds represent one third of the budget and innovation and research and development also account for a large chunk of it. Ireland has been trying to prevent a significant reduction in the overall MFF funding. If there are to be cuts, we will seek to protect the CAP budget within that. Some 85% of all EU money coming into Ireland comes through CAP. This amounts to approximately €1.6 billion per annum. We had some success in the negotiations. At one stage, it looked like there was going to be a cut to CAP of approximately 6% or 7% in terms of pillar 1 and about 11% in pillar 2. By the end of the discussions, this had been reduced to a 3% cut in pillar 1, which was progress. The difference was about €8 billion across the Union.

If we cannot get the MFF agreed in February, it will be difficult, in terms of the timescale, to do this.

That being said, I think it is possible for us to revive the sugar industry, but only if a number of things happen. First of all, I have made it clear that the Government is not going to subsidise the setting up of a new sugar industry because we need to ensure that any new industry that begins in Ireland again can stand on its own two feet. However, I believe there is a fighting chance that the sugar industry will be set up again in Ireland on a commercial basis. Last summer we had two very professionally put together viability studies for the setting up of a sugar industry in Ireland again, from a processing point of view, which would involve building a large sugar processing plant and ethanol production facility. There are a number of people who are extremely committed to making this happen and they are very credible people. Michael Hoey, in particular, who heads up Beet Ireland, has put a huge amount of his own resources and time into putting together a very realistic business plan for rebuilding a sugar processing sector in Ireland. It is his job to put the business case together and he will do that, in terms of attracting investors and so forth. It is my job to ensure that if that business case is to proceed that there is either a sugar quota for Ireland in the future or there is no sugar quota in the European Union.  The current sugar regime in the EU will end in 2015 and Ireland has already been compensated to get out of that regime to the tune of €353 million. That means that we are not going to be able to produce sugar before 2015. The Commission is proposing that the sugar quota regime would end in 2015, which is something that Ireland supports. However, I do not think it is realistic because the countries that currently have sugar quota will insist on the quota regime extending beyond 2015, in my view, possibly until 2018 or 2020. In that context, we will be seeking an opportunity for Ireland to be allocated quota for domestic use, given the fact that we have been compensated to be out of the sugar industry until 2015 but not beyond that. Given the size of our food industry here and the volume of sugar use in that industry, we should be allowed a sugar quota to be able to support it. We have made a very strong case for this, both publicly and privately, to the Commission.

As the Minister has said, at least one feasibility study has been carried out-----

Is there a potential for the industry, provided certain things happen and if they do not happen, what is the position? What is our competitive position vis-à-vis other sugar producing countries across the EU?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	804	The feasibility studies were very professionally done. Both of them were presented to me and both of them involved detailed meetings around the presentation of those feasibility studies. We then asked officials in the economics section of my Department to assess the feasibility of the business plans. It is important to say, though, that in order for those business plans to be viable, the price of processed sugar must remain at a level that can pay for all of this because we are talking about a €200 million investment to build the plant before any sugar beet can be processed to produce either ethanol or sugar. It is probably fair to say, as a rule of thumb, that these feasibility studies stack up if the price of sugar remains at over €500 per tonne. It is well over that level at the moment and actually, in the last 12 months, it was close to €800 per tonne because there were real shortages of sugar in the European Union. A lot of food industries in Ireland, some from my own part of the country, were finding it hard to get sugar at any price, which suggests that there is an argument around sugar security for both the pharmaceutical and food industries. Having said that, a judgment has to be made by the investors and those putting the business plan together as to what the likely sugar price will be in three, five or ten years time and what the price will be if sugar quotas are abolished in the European Union. When we were producing sugar in Ireland we were not particularly competitive vis-à-vis other parts of Europe in terms of the tonnage of beet per hectare we were growing and the sugar content. However, I believe we can be much more competitive now and the proof of that can be seen in the United Kingdom at the moment. The varieties of sugar beet being grown there are highly competitive with other parts of Europe and there is no reason Ireland could not benefit from that. We can be competitive in this area but whether this happens will be contingent on where world sugar prices go. In my view, they are not likely to collapse any time soon. Sugar is in strong demand because consumption will continue to grow, both in the European Union and, more important, further afield.

Deputies will know that the Government made a decision in principle to move ahead with preparing for and investigating the possibility of a sale of Coillte forests. Essentially this involves selling the harvesting rights to commercial Coillte forests and the investigative and preparatory process is under way. Work is ongoing between Coillte, NewEra - which is managing this process - and my Department. Consultants have also been brought in to do specific work around valuations and managing how the sales process may proceed, with the aim of maximising the value to the State, if value is to be found, as well as taking account of the other sectors that may be impacted by such a sale, such as the sawmill sector and timber supply generally, which is totally dominated by Coillte at the moment. This is a very complex process which we are in the middle of at the moment but I assure Deputies that the Government will act with caution. We will not do anything that will undermine or significantly damage the timber or sawmill sectors in Ireland. Effectively, we have a monopoly in Coillte at the moment. Most sawmills take more than 80% of their timber from Coillte forests. If we proceed with this, we will do so with caution to try to protect other sectors that will be affected by any sale, while at the same time trying to maximise value for the State.

I ask the Minister to clarify that issue.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	807	The Government decision was straightforward. We are not selling the company or the land. The principal decision was to investigate and, if it makes sense to do so, proceed with the sale of harvesting rights for Coillte forests. This would involve selling crops early, just like farmers might sell 30% of their barley crops before they are mature. This is one option for realising the value of State assets, that is, the standing timber on State-owned land managed by Coillte, at a time when we need cashflow. In the context of that sale, a range of complex issues arise which need to be addressed if we are to proceed with our plans. The only decision that the Government has taken is that we will prepare for the sales process with a view to making a decision in the new year on whether it makes sense to continue the process in terms of realising value for the State without compromising strategic assets.

I understand the downturn in the economy has had a minimal effect on the numbers employed in the sector thanks to the flexibility of both employers and employees. I ask the Minister for his assurance that the employment prospects and long-term viability of the saw milling sector will be borne in mind in any decision taken.

The timber industry is very important for the saw milling sector but I am sure he will accept that the 18 million people who visit Coillte forests every year are also important in terms of recreation and environmental matters. Does he agree that the proposal to sell the forest assets owned by Coillte presents a serious threat to the use of forests by the people? It is an issue about which we are all concerned and I have received a considerable number of e-mails from groups which use Coillte forests for recreation and environmental matters.

That includes public access. Most of the forests to which there is public access are not commercial crops. At least 25% of Coillte's estate comprises mature broadleaf forest primarily used for recreation. That will remain the case. These forests will remain in the ownership of the State and under the management of Coillte. The sale will involve standing commercial timber and we will proceed with caution and in a way that is consistent with the Government's decision.

Over the past six years, the number has increased from 600 to 1,450 per year. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of young men and women who want to get into farming and we need to offer them a future. That is why an Irish proposal was taken on by the Commission as part of the Common Agricultural Policy reform to ask countries to set aside 2% of pillar 1 single farm payment money over the next five years for top-up payments for young farmers under the age of 40. In other words, single farm payments for young farmers under the age of 40 will be topped up by 25%, up to a maximum of five years. It is like an installation aid scheme except that it is sponsored by European money. Ireland's proposal was supported by Hungary and the Commission has taken it on. Irrespective of whether it is mandatory or voluntary, it will be implemented if I am still Minister. We need to support young farmers in terms of giving them a financial advantage to allow them to invest in expanding their businesses. That will boost the realisation of the targets in Food Harvest 2020. Pillar 2 also provides opportunities to support young farmers through a series of programmes supported by rural development funds. In terms of national policy, despite all the difficult decisions taken in the budget, we acted strategically to support young farmers by encouraging the consolidation of farms, and maintaining the preferential treatment they get in terms of stock relief, exemption from stamp duty and partnerships where sons and daughters work with their parents to manage the farm. A number of positive initiatives are being taken in the interests of young farmers to address the generational problem.

The prospects for young farmers having access to land other than by leasing arrangements are limited and unless they win the lotto or inherit large sums of money, they are often unable to buy the sort of acreage that would rapidly create a viable holding. Does the Minister see a need for a co-ordinated approach to stock relief, leasing arrangements and special tax breaks for those who own the land to ensure young people who graduate from agricultural colleges can seamlessly enter the industry and provide the energy it clearly needs?

Quality education is key to developing Irish agriculture and giving it a competitive edge in Europe. The Minister may be aware, however, that at least six agricultural colleges closed across the midlands during my lifetime. There is a significant deficit in terms of educational facilities. I have raised this issue in the House in respect of the midlands and Deputy Kirk's area.

We do not have plans to build new agricultural colleges. What happened was that there was a dramatic fall-off in the numbers of young men, in particular, going to agricultural colleges. As a result, some of the colleges closed and there was huge pressure to close others. I remember sitting in a committee room trying to persuade policymakers that we should not be shutting colleges such as Rockwell, Gurteen, Clonakilty and others. Fortunately, that did not happen and now these colleges are operating at full capacity. Buildings are not the problem. The problem is the availability of adequate staffing and expertise.

Therefore, having to attend an agricultural college in another part of the country is not a disaster. I went to Gurteen agricultural college, which is a long way from where I live in Cork, and had a really good year there. I probably learned more in that year about farming than I did during my three year degree programme in agricultural science. It works well when people from different parts of the country move to other parts where they can meet different types of farmers with whom they can live and learn while in agricultural college.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	822	I mentioned this issue earlier in connection with a matter raised by Deputy Martin Ferris. I would like to explain the decisions taken in last week's budget on the sheep grassland scheme. We had a three year grassland scheme which was costing the country approximately €18 million a year, using unspent funds under Pillar 1. The aim of the scheme and the idea behind it was to increase the number of sheep being farmed in Ireland because for ten years in a row the flock decreased in size year after year. We had to try to reverse that trend. I am delighted to be able to say the scheme has contributed significantly to reversing it and for the first time in a decade, the flock is bigger this year. Therefore, the scheme has worked well. I now want to try what I know has worked in other sectors, particularly in the dairy sector, in which we have seen the benefit of discussion groups. In the dairy sector dairy farmers meet on a monthly basis in what they might call "dairy discussion groups" to discuss how their business works and how their animals are performing and everything else. The issues discussed include fertility, grazing, feed conversion efficiency, stock management and so on. The evidence we have from the groups is that, on average, farmers who attend them have increased their profit margins by somewhere between 4% and 5%. I want to see the same benefits in the sheep sector. The sheep grassland scheme was due to end this year, but we have chosen to extend it into next year. We will spend €14 million on it next year and use €3 million from the budget to initiate a sheep discussion group model to encourage sheep farmers to enter the type of discussion group setting that has worked so well for the dairy and beef sectors in order that we can help sheep farmers to make more in the market place rather than rely on schemes for an income. This is a progressive measure. It is about using money in the most progressive way we can, given the problems we face.

What has been the result of that assessment? Has the expenditure been justified? Obviously, the Minister has decided to change direction. Should there be a continuation of the financial support provided under the original scheme?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	828	The scheme has been a success on a number of levels. We had seen sheep numbers reduce year on year and were getting to a stage where the perception was developing that a farmer could not make money from sheep farming. We had to put a scheme in place to help farmers to make more money from responsible sheep production and that was the origin of the sheep grassland scheme which was a three year scheme. This was to be the last year of the scheme. We believe it makes sense to continue it but to divert some of the money towards a discussion group model that we know has worked well for other sectors in order that, as well as supporting the income of sheep farmers and the quality of production, we can help upskill them to ensure they are maximising the potential of their holdings and the returns they obtain. That is what discussion groups do. Although farmers have seen this move as a cut to the sheep grassland scheme, they should instead look at it in the round and realise that while there is a slight reduction in financial support for the scheme, there is a new opportunity for them to sign up to participate in a sheep discussion group through which they will be paid €1,000 a year to attend meetings and participate in discussions that will help them to run a more effective lamb and sheep production business. That is a good use of the money.

Producing suckler cows has been a way of life for them and even if they do not make money one year, they stay in the business because it is their way of life. The ending of the scheme is a huge blow for many small farmers who have depended on this money. The allowance used to be €80 which was cut to €40 and now it is €20, payable on a maximum of 20 animals. There is significant work involved for the farmers concerned. Last week I spoke to a farmer who had gone through all his records for his animals, including date of birth, date of tagging of cow and calf, the rate of calving, the date of dehorning, the date of castration, date of meal introduction and so on. He needs three bags of meal for just one calf.

I hope I have answered the questions on sheep farming. I answered questions on the beef sector for Deputy Martin Ferris, but I will respond to Deputy Mick Wallace. I am not targeting the small guys. The new scheme we are putting in place - a €10 million scheme - will ensure farmers with 20 or fewer suckler cows will receive payments on all of them. We made this provision deliberately to ensure smaller farmers would receive their payments first. The bigger farmers, with more than 20 animals, may receive payment on more than 20 animals, if there is money left over as I suspect there will be at the end of the process. The other aspect is that the new scheme does not requires farmers to do anything other than transfer data relating to the breeding and fertility of their animals to the ICBF. We are not asking them to do all the other things they would have been paid for before. In other words, they are being asked to do a fraction of what they were asked to do before and they are being paid €20 per cow rather than €40 per cow. It is important for the Deputy to understand that the total amount of money going into the beef sector next year will not be very different from what went into the beef sector this year. That is because under the existing suckler cow welfare scheme, at least €10 million is to be paid next year in respect of calves that were born in the second half of this year. When that €10 million is taken with the €10 million we will spend on the new data transfer scheme and the €5 million we will spend on beef discussion groups - farmers will be given €1,000 to attend meetings and learn about how they can run their businesses more effectively - it means we will be spending €25 million on the beef sector next year. Most of that will be spent in the suckler beef sector. We spent approximately €27 million in the beef sector this year. It is important for farmers to get this into context. Since the budget, there has been a blunt focus on arguing that the abolition of the suckler cow welfare scheme is a disaster. I suggest there should be a concentration on what we are putting in place to replace it. The State will be putting almost as much money into the suckler sector next year as it has put into it this year. We are prioritising small farmers in that mix.

What is the position at the moment? What was it in each of the last three years? What is the trend?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-12-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	840	I take the Minister's point. I have been listening to a couple of farmers who will be seriously affected by this change. They were getting €80. I know the Minister is saying they will have less work to do now in terms of documentation and registration, etc., but they did not mind doing the work. That is what these small farmers were used to doing. It was a good idea for them to keep records like this. I do not know if they will have to do as much feeding under the new scheme. The level of feeding they had to do under the old scheme made sense. It is pretty draconian for a small farmer to have the payment he gets for each calf reduced from €80 to €20.

I agree that this was a great scheme. It improved the quality of suckler beef in Ireland and brought about significant changes in areas like animal husbandry, data collection and the general performance of those animals. While I would have put a new scheme in place anyway, I would have liked to have had more money to spend on building up the suckler cow welfare scheme. I hope we will be able to spend more money in this area in the future. When the new Common Agricultural Policy is in place, I hope we will be able to fund a larger scheme than the one to be implemented next year. It is important to understand that all of the €25 million being spent in this sector will go to farmers. It may go to different farmers next year. It is important to recognise that contrary to what some farmers have claimed, there will be no dramatic reduction in the money going into this sector, all of which will go to farmers as I have said.

Half of the beef in Ireland comes from the suckler herd and the other half comes from the dairy herd. As I have said on many occasions, if we do not support the suckler herd, beef will simply become a by-product of the dairy industry as it expands and grows in the context of the elimination of quotas in 2015. I do not want that to happen because all of the real quality Irish beef comes from the suckler herd. It is delivered by the bloodlines and the breeding. That is why this sector needs additional support. I hope we will be able to provide it in the context of the new Common Agricultural Policy.

The questions we have been discussing this evening relate to what is probably the most important industry in the country. I do not have a problem with being here after 8 p.m. If some of the earlier business had not finished ahead of schedule, however, Question Time would not have started yet. It was not due to start until 8.45 p.m. I assure the Minister that I am not carping when I say that the Whips need to examine the arrangements for the scheduling of the business of the House, particularly on Thursday evenings. I am saying this in the context of agriculture questions, but it applies to other areas as well. We should be able to revert to the traditional afternoon slot for Question Time.

As I said earlier, at least I got the benefit of a lovely plate of sole. I thank those who posed the questions and the Minister who replied to them. I thank the Clerk and the staff for their attendance.
