          <p eId="para_8">I would like to ask the Minister about the definitions of the treaty.  What will happen in terms of the ratification process - I will allow the Chairman to guide me if this should be under a different section - if there are changes to the ESM at the next Council summit or a subsequent summit?  There has been a lot of discussion about the ESM facilitating direct lending to banks.  If that were to happen, it would require a treaty change.  What impact would that have on the ratification of the Bill that is before us?</p>

          <p eId="para_9">The negotiation stage of the treaty is completed, and a text has been agreed among the member states.  The treaty will not be amended because we are now in the middle of the ratification stage, which will continue.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to enable us to ratify it.  If people subsequently decide to amend the treaty, those amendments will have to be renegotiated and an amended treaty will have to be ratified.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">If amendments were agreed at the next Council summit, Ireland would not yet have ratified the treaty at that stage.  I know it is difficult to say, as we are talking hypothetically, but would we have to halt the ratification and consider a new Bill?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Finance">

          <p eId="para_11">Some countries have ratified already, so I do not think that is feasible, although I will consult about it in a minute.  I do not think it is feasible, once the ratification process is under way and some countries have ratified, to stop the process.  It would be unfair to the countries that have ratified.  What would happen is that ratification would proceed and then, if people had a different view of what the powers of the treaty should be, they would have to come back with an amended version.  It would be rather like amending legislation here - an ESM No. 2 treaty.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_12">To be clear, what the Minister is saying is that regardless of the conclusions of the summit, the ratification process will take place across the member states that have agreed to ratify the treaty, and if there is a need to ratify an amending treaty, that would involve a separate piece of legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_13">That is how I see it.  At least, that would be the legal position.  If there was a strong view that the provisions were inadequate and a clear signal that amendments would be introduced, it would be up to the countries that were in the process of ratification to decide whether to proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">With regard to the Spanish bailout of up to €100 million, which is to be channelled through the sovereign and invested in the Spanish banks, is there clarity yet on whether that funding will come from the European Financial Stability Facility or the ESM?  Given the scale of the recapitalisation required, it would put a substantial dent in the ESM, which has a potential lending capacity of up to €500 billion; one fifth of it would be gone immediately.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify that matter for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Picking up on Deputy Doherty's point about the banking licence, I understand we are dealing with the treaty as it is presented, but is it even on the agenda at this stage that the ESM could be given a banking licence to enable it to borrow directly from the European Central Bank?  Is the issue of direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM throughout the eurozone under active consideration?  Clearly, that would have been the preference of the Spanish authorities, but they failed to achieve it.  In the conference call, was there an open discussion of the possibility of direct recapitalisation which would be kept out of the sovereign balance sheet?  That is the fundamental question to which people want an answer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_16">When it comes to European affairs, I have learned never to say never.  For example, the power the EFSF now has, which will be exercised in the case of Spain to provide money for the recapitalisation of banks, was conferred by way of amendment last July.  There is an analogous precedent that one can point to in terms of subsequent amendment of treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">In the teleconference, I was the only one, speaking on behalf of Ireland, who expressed the view that it would be better if funding of the sovereign was separate from funding of the banks, and that a mechanism should be found for direct bank recapitalisation.  I said I would not seek a discussion on it in the teleconference, because others were not expressing an interest, but that I would raise it again in the context of euro group and ECOFIN meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">While the methodology and the amount that Spain can apply to recapitalise its banks have how been agreed, Spain has not yet applied for funds.  It says the reason is that it needs to complete stress-testing domestically to know exactly what the amounts will be.  Spain is arguing that the amounts are much smaller than the figures given by various consultants internationally.  The communication after the teleconference not only speaks of providing funds for the recapitalisation of the Spanish banks, but also states - this is not a direct quote, but words to that effect - that €100 billion is more than the expected requirement and that a significant safety margin was built into the figures.  There is a problem at the moment.  Before we came in here, some of my advisers checked the position of Spain on the bond markets, and bond yields are moving close to 7% this morning.  It seems there is a lot of uncertainty.  As Spain has not actually applied, there are various estimates of what would be required, and of course there is the overhang from the Greek election.  We are in a difficult period in European affairs, especially in the eurozone, but from our point of view, we will continue to fulfil the terms of the programme, proceed with the ratification of the treaty and pay close attention to what is happening outside.  It is the policy of the Irish Government that recapitalisation of sovereigns should be separated from recapitalisation of banks and that a mechanism should be found to recapitalise banks in such a way that the recapitalisation would not form part of the general government debt and, in normal parlance, would be off the sovereign balance sheet.  That view is shared by other countries also, and we will continue to pursue it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlexWhite" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_19">We are on the definitions section of the Bill, but I will allow some latitude, as these issues are obviously important.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_20">The reason the Spanish bond yields are approaching 7% is the folly of potentially adding €100 billion to Spain's national debt, expecting that that will enhance Spain's attractiveness in the markets as a country to lend to.  Of course, it has the opposite effect, and that is why the bond yields are going up.  I am glad the Minister directly raised the question of the ESM recapitalising banks so that the recapitalisation is kept away from the sovereign.  Is there much support for that position?  One would assume the Spanish authorities pushed strongly for that option but failed to get it over the line.  It could have a beneficial impact for Ireland if such a decision was made.  Is there much support for that, and is the Minister confident that the thinking in the eurozone will move in that direction over time?</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Can the Minister clarify whether the EFSF or the ESM will be funding the Spanish bailout?  Will there be enough money in the ESM if €100 billion is going to go to Spain and its banks?  With bond yields approaching 7%, Spain is on the brink of being out of the markets and being declared unsustainable in terms of the rates that are being charged.  What impact would that have for the lending capacity of the ESM to meet the needs that will, inevitably, come before it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_22">There is significant support for the idea of funding the banks directly in a manner that would not go on the sovereign balance sheet, but it would not be very strong among the triple A countries.  Europe is a democracy of democracies.  The people who pay the piper have a stronger say in matters like this.  I do not know what happened in the background to the Spanish negotiations before a proposal was put.  I assume they could not get agreement from the primary funders to do it in a manner that is off-balance sheet.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">As well as that, there is no legal mechanism within the EFSF to do so.  While there is now, since last July, mechanism for the EFSF to fund the recapitalisation of banks outside a general programme for sovereign, there is not a mechanism to do it in a manner where the sovereign would not be the guarantor.  Spain is doing it through some kind of special purpose vehicle but it is clear, from all the documentation I have seen to date, that the sovereign is responsible for the servicing of the loan and for the its repayment.  To put it at its simplest, it is on-balance sheet.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">With regard to the Deputy's question on EFSF-ESM, the communiqué put a stroke between the two and said the funding would be done from EFSF/ESM.  The understanding was that if the Spanish Government applied pretty quickly for the funds available they would come, in the first instance, through the EFSF.  Subsequently, when the ESM is ratified, the source of the funding would be the ESM.  There are slightly different rules for the two.  All creditors of the EFSF are of equal status.  In the ESM the sovereign contributors have preferential status.  That would, obviously, have an influence on the bond market.  Credit default swaps, CDS, being activated, and so on, would have to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">To make it even more complicated, there was no clarification of the legal position if EFSF loans become ESM loans.  Would they acquire a new status or would the status at the point of lending, in terms of preference, apply?  I cannot answer that question.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_26">Some of these issues will come up as we deal with other sections, but if we can resolve them at the start it will help us as we progress through the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">In terms of the State's position, the Minister said he would like to see a separation of the sovereign and the banks and a direct lending facility to the banks which would be kept off the sovereign's balance sheet.  If he was to achieve that objective, would the State then have no responsibility for money given by the ESM to the banks?  Would the State give no guarantees and have no liability with regard to that lending?  Is it proposed simply that the transaction would be kept off the sovereign balance sheet but would be, in some way, guaranteed by the sovereign?  Would it be a mere accounting measure to keep our debt levels down, with the sovereign ultimately responsible for it, or is it the Minister's view, which I would share, that money should be lent directly to the banks and that the banks and the lender should be responsible for the transaction, and not the sovereign?  Could the Minister outline that matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I have already replied.  It is our position that we would like to see a direct funding mechanism to the banks.  In that case, it would not be sovereign debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Deputy Doherty is familiar with all the arguments.  Europe is an evolving situation.  The eurozone is evolving rapidly at present.  We will see where we are next week.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I am disappointed that my amendments relating to one of my big concerns have been ruled out of order.  That concern is that the ESM which is backed by the taxpayers' money is going into directly lending to banks while the banks take no hits.  There are subordinate bondholders in Spain who will be paid in full.  There are people who bought bonds in the secondary market.  The Minister is familiar with this issue and made these arguments when in opposition.  People who bought bonds at 60 cent to the euro are now being paid in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Has the Minister put forward any proposals in this regard?  Does he believe any direct lending to banks should be subject to write-downs and that losses should be imposed on bondholders before any direct lending from EU funds is given to those banks?  We can have a discussion as to categories of bondholders but this should apply, at a minimum, to subordinate bondholders.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I do not know what the precise difficulties are in individual Spanish banks.  I am sure the Spanish authorities have a fairly good view of that.  If the Spanish authorities decide on a resolution process with some of their banks I assume the same rules will apply, under the guidance of the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I have not come across any suggestion that they would not be allowed to mark down their subordinate bondholders in the Spanish banking system.  We got €5.8 billion of savings, if one would call it that, from resolving subordinate, or junior, bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">There are many banks in Spain.  There are different categories and a slightly different licensing system from here.  I have no familiarity with the Spanish situation.  I have seen nothing that would inhibit the Spanish authorities from moving against subordinate bondholders if that is what they decided to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I know there is nothing to prevent the Spanish, Irish or any other authority doing that if they so wished.  The Bill will allow for recapitalisation to sovereigns in order to bail out banks, without imposing any requirement that bondholders who took a risk and gambled on those banks take a hit.  If the Minister is willing to inject European taxpayers' money into recapitalising banks there should, at least, be a condition that there would be write-downs, in terms of some sections of the bondholders.  There is nothing to stop any authority doing that but there is no requirement to do so within the treaty.  There is no statement of the principle that those who took the risk within the banks should take the hit.  The liability falls on European taxpayers.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">The point I am making is that the Title section refers to this Bill being in the public interest and the stability of the European Union.  Is that not a farcical suggestion given what we now know, particularly in the aftermath of the unravelling of the Spanish attempt to recapitalise its banks and separate that aspect from its sovereign debt.  There will be a consequent liability imposed on ordinary Spanish people and the consequences will almost certainly mean that Spain will be locked out of the international bond markets and that €100 billion will turn into €200 billion, €250 billion or a lot more once it has to borrow to roll over its debts, manage its deficit, which will balloon, etc.  The evidence that this approach does not work is definitive.  Fianna Fáil have more excuses at this stage than the Minister and European leaders because one could argue that at the outset of this crisis people were bumped along by events and panicked into giving bank guarantees wrongly believing that could stem the crisis.  In some ways it was difficult for anybody to get their bearings on what was happening but the jury is out now in terms of the possible consequences of giving blanket guarantees to the banking system and forcing the citizens of this State to pick up the tab for that.  It is a disastrous strategy because the direct effect of recapitalising the banks and putting the sovereign on the hook will be to immediately force countries out of the bond markets, make them unable to finance themselves, lock them into a spiral of ballooning debt, ballooning deficits and then force them into further austerity programmes to pay for that, with all the negative consequences in terms of contracting economic growth.  The evidence for that is piling up across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I do not understand the reason the Minister and others who represent states that are the victims of this are not screaming from the rooftops at the madness of this approach.  How can it be justified when it is clearly not producing the stability this approach claims it will bring about and when is clearly not in the public interest?  It is counter to the public interest.</p>

At the outset the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, said the bank guarantee would cover only a few billion euro for the banks but it got worse and we ended up paying €70 billion, with all the desperate effects of that in terms of deficit and debt for the State.  Initially, Spain was talking about €40 billion.  It is up to €100 billion now.  If it is locked out of the markets we do not know where it will end.  It may involve hundreds of billions of euro.  Italy will have to roll over approximately €1 trillion in debt.  If it is locked out of the markets as a result of similar action we are talking about an enormous hole, so to speak.  Is it not the fact that this cannot work?</p>

          <p eId="para_60">On the section, I will not challenge the Chairman's ruling because that would not be in line with protocol but I am disappointed with it.  I outlined in my Second Stage contribution - I will not rehearse it as we had that debate - that Sinn Féin supports the idea of an emergency lending facility in Europe.  That is the reason we supported the ratification of amendment No. 136 of the European treaties Act.  There is a requirement for a number of amendments to this Bill, including that the ECB be allowed to finance the ESM and that there should be creditor write-downs.  We will deal with the issues around immunity at a later stage.  Also, the point we will deal with when dealing with section 2 is that we do not have a step-out facility from the ESM which we had in the EFSF where programme countries did not contribute to the funding mechanism because they were in a programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The out-working of this is that this State will provide €1.27 billion to the ESM which we will have borrowed from the EFSF and the IMF at a blended interest rate of 3.7% and then borrow it back from the ESM at an interest rate of approximately 3%.  There is an illogical argument in regard to that point in that we are borrowing money from European sources at an interest rate, giving it back to a European source for free and then borrowing it from them again at another interest rate.  I assume the Minister would have been opposed to that because it is a disadvantage to this State that we do not have the step-out facility.  He might elaborate on how those negotiations failed and we were unable to keep in place the procedure with the EFSF in terms of the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">On section 2 and the five contributions that are to be made to the ESM if this treaty is ratified, the initial authorised capital stock, two of which are to be made this year - one next month and the other in the autumn - and one the following year totalling €1.27 billion, what procedure will be used to make those payments?  Will it be the Cabinet?  Will it be the Minister?  Will it come to the Oireachtas?  Those payments, in line with protocol, should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be approved.  That ties in with section 3 which we will come to because as we discussed, it may not stop with €1.27 billion.  Our liability under this Bill is unknown, and we will deal with that later, but we know there is a potential liability of up to €11 billion.  I want to know the procedures the Minister will use to hand over that €0.25 million next month and again in the autumn.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_41" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_63">It would be helpful to members if I read the briefing note first and we can then discuss some of the detail, if that is agreed.  Section 2 provides that the Minister for Finance may, on behalf of the State, make payments to the ESM to cover Ireland's contribution to our share of the authorised capital stock of the ESM in accordance with the treaty.  The authorised capital stock of the ESM is set out in Article 8 of the ESM treaty, which was signed by euro area member states on 2 February 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">To obtain the highest possible credit rating, the authorised capital stock of the ESM shall be €700 billion.  Of this amount, €80 billion will be in the form of paid-in capital by the euro area member states, paid in five equal instalments from July 2012.  The balance, €620 billion, will be callable capital.  The contribution key for each member state is set out in Annex 1 to the treaty and is based on the ECB capital contribution key.  For Ireland, the key is 1.592% of the total paid and committed capital.  Ireland's share of the €80 billion in paid-in capital, based on our contribution key, will be just above €1.27 billion, paid in five equal instalments of €254 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Unlike the EFSF, there is no stepping-out facility in the ESM when members enter a programme of support.  Therefore, Ireland will have to pay its share of the paid-in capital.  Ireland's share of the €620 billion callable capital is based on the same key, that is, 1.592% of €620 billion, making the callable capital €9.87 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">The ESM is being established as an intergovernmental organisation under public international law.  Ireland's contribution will be treated as a financial transaction.  This means that, while it will have an impact on Ireland's Exchequer borrowing requirement, it will not have an impact on its general Government deficit.  Ireland's share of the €620 billion in callable capital will be accounted for as a contingent liability on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Following the decision of the euro group on 30 March 2012, the paid-in capital will be made available more quickly than initially foreseen in the original ESM treaty.  Two tranches of capital will be paid in 2012, the first one in July and the second by October.  Another two tranches will be paid in 2013 and a final tranche in the first half of 2014.  In line with the ESM treaty, the payment of the capital will be further accelerated if needed to maintain a 15% ratio between the paid-in capital and the outstanding amount of ESM issuances.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Any decision to change the authorised capital stock of the ESM will require a unanimous decision of the ESM's board of governors.  I, as Minister for Finance, will be governor for Ireland at the board and serve to ensure Ireland's interests are represented and protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">With regard to the step-in, step-out provisions, the arrangement for the EFSF is that we step out.  While there are disadvantages to that, the advantage is that we do not contribute.  The Deputies' argument is that if one steps out, one will not have to make a contribution.  However, if one steps out, one has no negotiating position.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Sinn Féin has often spoken about negotiation.  The essential requirement in a negotiation is that one have a position.  Let us suppose that an arrangement were made with Spain such that the banks would be capitalised directly.  If this were achieved in a manner in which we had no say, it would put us at a disadvantage.  Alternatively, if we have a say and there is not a step-out facility, Ireland's agreement to whatever deal would be made for the disbursement of funds from the ESM would be essential before the proposed programme could be implemented.  The ESM is the permanent bailout fund and the EFSF was always conceived as temporary.  As a full member of the eurozone and the European Union, it is better that Ireland have all the obligations and the rights by not having a step-out facility, in which case every decision requires our agreement. It is a matter of opinion but I am of the view that we are better off not having a step-out facility.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">In those cases where unanimity is required, the vote of every state is required before a programme can be put in place.  A veto sounds like a threat but, in many cases, Europe proceeds by unanimity.  However, if one steps out, one is not involved in the unanimous decision because one is apart from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The capital structure of the ESM has been put in place to support the borrowing and lending activities.  If or when the ESM engages in programme funding, it will borrow money on the international financial markets and lend it to the beneficiary ESM member state.  This is how the EFSF operates currently.  The capital of the ESM will not be paid out directly to programme countries but will only fall to be called upon in the event that member states borrowing from the ESM default or that the ESM incurs losses in ESM operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">As I outlined, we will be paying two tranches in 2012 and two in 2013, and a final tranche.  It will be accounted for in the normal way.  I presume it will be paid out of the Vote of central funds.  That is dealt with in section 3.  There is a reporting mechanism whereby there must be a report issued every six months.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a role and there are general debates on Estimates.  There is always accountability to the Dáil in respect of disbursements from the central fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I do not agree with the Minister's argument on the step-out facility.  The position at present is that the ESM does not exist, as we know.  The EFSF does exist and Ireland has stepped out of it.  The Minister's logic is that we would have no negotiating power.  I am not sure why he participated in the teleconference and was arguing for direct capitalisation of banks if he has stepped out.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_77">The Minister said that if we step out, we do not have the ability to negotiate.  Under the existing mechanism, we have stepped out, yet I am sure the Minister's opinion is valued by his counterparts in Europe.  He may tell me we do not have a negotiating position because we have stepped out but his logic is that if we were to step out from the ESM, our argument would not carry weight.  The same logic would have to apply as with the EFSF.  The reason the provision in included - I can understand why some would argue for its inclusion – is that the EFSF was fundamentally flawed.  The ESM is flawed also and the problem is that, with an increase in the number of programme countries, including Greece, Portugal and Ireland and soon to include Spain, Italy and others, the fund will become increasingly weak and its status and credit rating will be diminished.  This is why there is a need for the ECB to be the lender of last resort for the fund.  That argument is not the main item on the agenda at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I asked particular questions on the procedure used to make the payments.  I take it from the Minister's answer that no Oireachtas approval will be required to make the payments of €250 million next month and in the autumn, and €500 million next year, etc.  We focus continually on the sum of €1.27 billion, the callable authorised capital.  This Bill allows for the placing of contingent liability on the State of at least €11 billion.  The procedure the Minister will apply regarding the payment in July would be the procedure he would apply if, for example, the contingent liability were called upon.  It could be the case that the board of governors of the ESM would say the callable capital of this State needs to be increased to €8 billion, as allowed for in the Bill, and that the Irish Government would make that payment without any reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The only reference in this regard in the legislation is that we will not, under section 3, exceed the sum of €11.145 billion.  At that point it will need approval of the Oireachtas and, obviously, this legislation would need to be amended.  I am concerned not only about the scheduled payments but the contingent liability which could be called upon without the Minister seeking the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">My position about the step-out issue is not that Ireland's voice is not considered to be a valued contribution when matters are being discussed at EU level.  When Ireland's Ministers make contributions, they are listened to very carefully and treated very seriously.  We are a country in good standing within the eurozone and the European Union.  The point I am making is that when it comes to the decision making of whether money will be drawn down from the European financial stability facility, EFSF, Ireland's voice is not necessary in agreeing to disperse moneys whereas if we do not step out, it would be necessary.  The only point I am making is that it seems to me that in certain circumstances it will give us a stronger position.  I am not making much of it but I am trying to give the Deputy the thinking behind the step-in and step-out argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">On the accountability for funds dispersed, section 3 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_81">There may be paid out of the Central Fund or the growing produce of that Fund sums, aggregating to a sum not exceeding €11,145,400,000 to enable the State to make payments in respect of its contribution to the authorised capital stock of the ESM in accordance with the Treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">The legal mandate is given in the Bill.  It not only covers the contributions which have to be made over the next three years but also the contingent liability of up to €11 billion.  The legal authority will be given by the Houses of the Oireachtas when the Bill is enacted.  The procedure will be that the Minister for Finance will bring a memorandum to the Government if any disbursements have to be made which the Government will then authorise.  In the same way as any payments to any organisation and authorised by the Government are subject to the scrutiny of the House, the normal rules of scrutiny and accountability will apply in this case, too.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_83">We know what is in this legislation with the contingent liability and the initial drawdown.  Many people are of the view that because the payments of the five tranches are scheduled over the next three years amounting to €1.27 billion, if the full €11 billion were to be drawn down, it would be appropriate it would be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am fully aware that if this legislation is passed, it will give the legal basis to the State to pay these moneys into the fund.  The only reason there would be a call on the contingent liability is if losses were accrued and money was lent from the ESM that would not be paid back.  For example, what would happen if the Spanish banks were not able to pay half the money they borrowed through the sovereign and, therefore, there was a call on additional capital?  With the Government's majority, it is likely it would get approval.  However, in the interests of democracy and to continue to put money into the ESM drip by drip until it amounts to €11 billion, I cannot see why the Minister would not insert a provision to ensure that any additional calls above the €1.27 billion already approved would seek the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">If capital contributions were subject to parliamentary votes on each occasion they were paid, the capital structure of the ESM would be uncertain and undermined.  One of the virtues of the ESM is that one knows what it is, its rules and that it gives certainty.  It would be undermined completely if it were a fund that could only be exercised through the majority vote of parliaments across Europe.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_87">This is where the Bill puts a cap on the amount of money, up to €11.145 billion, the State can pay in to the ESM.  The treaty, in Article 10, section 1, allows that the board of governors shall review regularly and at least every five years the maximum lending volume and the adequacy of the authorised capital stock of the ESM.  It states that it can amend Article 8 and Annex II, which is where the €11 billion figure is referred to.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The legislation puts a cap on that fund of €11.145 billion.  In the case where the governors decide to increase the capital stock and to amend Article 8 and Annex II, basically to make a call on the State for additional funding, would it require an amendment to this legislation in that the Minister would not have the power to increase that?  The Minister will be one of the governors of the ESM, although maybe not at that time.  Will the Minister comment on that?  He mentioned earlier that one needs stability in terms of the funding.  It is clear within Article 10 that there is an ability for the governors to call up the authorised capital, but this places restrictions, which is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">There are serious questions in terms of the capital stock.  I mentioned the issue in terms of the ECB being there to provide unlimited resources.  The Minister mentioned that Spain has not as of yet applied for a bailout.  I assume Spain will be the only country so far that will apply for a second bailout before it has even applied for the first bailout, given that its bond rates are at 7%.  Things are happening quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">This legislation, if we go back to when it was drafted originally last year, was being presented by the Minister and others who agreed this formula as us needing the firepower to reassure the markets.  It has completely and utterly failed in its design.  There is a need for an emergency lending facility, but it has not reassured the markets.  Indeed, the bigger economies are starting to collapse and will need access to this funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Will the Minister outline whether an amendment to this legislation will be required if the board of governors exercises its powers under Article 10 of the treaty?  Will he explain how the treaty allows the board of governors to make an additional call, and yet the legislation that has been introduced caps that or creates, in the Minister's words, an uncertainty in making it subject to Oireachtas approval?  In response to me earlier, the Minister stated one cannot have the ESM as a funding model and it open to uncertainty in relation to Oireachtas approval, but Article 10 in the treaty is now uncertain because it will require approval of the Oireachtas.  It is something I welcome, but I ask the Minister to comment on both those issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_92">First, when a bailout fund for Europe was at its concept stage, there were various discussions about providing a firewall for Europe.  That was the terminology that was used initially.  There were debates about the adequacy of the firewall.  Deputy Michael McGrath is probably on the record as stating that the firewall is too low on the ESM treaty.  That view, that a bigger firewall is necessary, is widely shared across Europe.  The figure of €2 trillion was being touted at one stage as a possible firewall to prevent contagion spreading, as it is now spreading into countries such as Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">When the arrangements were made, the IMF was asked to contribute as well, and it did.  Taking into account the €500 billion, which grows to €700 billion under the ESM, and the IMF contribution, the firewall is somewhat in excess of $1 trillion.  On the face of it, it is a reasonable firewall and should meet quite a lot of need.  However, Deputy Pearse Doherty will recall that when the debate on firewalls was running, people were putting a bigger figure on it.  In Ireland, we were talking about a firewall one and a half times, or twice, that size.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">There is power under the treaty to ask states for additional contributions.  The enabling legislation is not the treaty, even though they interact.  As I understand it, the procedure would be that the governors are entitled to change the contributions which states would be expected to make under the sections to which Deputy Pearse Doherty draws attention.  Each participating state's finance Minister is a governor and decisions are by unanimity.  If it is the Minister for Finance about whom the Deputy speaks, the first hurdle would be that he or she would have to agree to the changing of the contribution level.  Were the Minister for Finance, on the authorisation of the Government, to agree, that would be a change within the powers of the governors in accordance with the treaty, but my view is that the Oireachtas, on the advice of the Government, would have to align the enabling legislation with the new contributory requirements under the treaty.  While no amendment of the treaty would be required, an amendment to section 3 of the Bill would be required to insert new contribution levels.  That is the way I would see it playing out in that event.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">It is not a big issue for me but it does not clarify that the treaty explicitly states in Article 10 that the board of governors will review the authorised capital stock at least every five years and can through unanimity change Article 8 and Annex II to increase the liability on this State above the current figure of €11 billion.  The Minister indicated that they have the ability to ask the State but their ability is stronger than that.  Article 8(4), which is referenced in Article 10 in regard to giving powers to the governors to increase the authorised stocks, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_99">ESM Members hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertake to provide their contribution to the authorised capital stock, in accordance with their contribution key in Annex I.  They shall meet all capital calls on a timely basis in accordance with the terms set out in this Treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">This allows for more than a request from the governors because we will have irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to provide the increased contributions to which the board of governors unanimously agrees under Article 10.  I am concerned about this provision.  It is proper that, at a bare minimum, any proposal to increase the capital stock would have to come before the Oireachtas by way of amendment but if we refused to amend section 3 of the enabling legislation we would be in conflict with Articles 8 and 10 of the treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">The governors are the finance Ministers of participating states.  The Irish Minister for Finance of the day, wearing the hat of governor of the ESM fund, would have to agree to the initial decision to raise the capital requirement.  Once that is done, certain other things follow.  Article 10 states: "The Board of Governors shall review regularly and at least every five years the maximum lending volume and the adequacy of the authorised capital stock of the ESM."  That is a prudent requirement.  Given that money values and the needs for which the money is required can change, it is important that we are not stuck with a permanent bailout mechanism set at 2012 values and contributions.  The Article also provides that the board of governors:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_102">[..] may decide to change the authorised capital stock and amend Article 8 and Annex II accordingly.  Such decision shall enter into force after the ESM Members have notified the Depositary of the completion of their applicable national procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">While the board of governors may make the change, it will not come into effect until participating states have completed their applicable national procedures.  In my understanding, this would require amendments to section 3 of the Bill.  That is how I see the matter working in practice.</p>

My point is that under Article 10 we are agreeing to allow the board of governors to increase that capital amount and under Article 8 we are agreeing to pay that increased capital amount.  I understand that the Minister will be a member of the board of governors and will be able to exercise a veto but why are we dealing with section 3?  I support the idea of setting a cap and requiring future increases to be agreed by the Oireachtas but this section is immaterial given that we have already agreed to the treaty provisions requiring us to pay any increase agreed by the board of governors.  If the Oireachtas decided not to pay the additional capital sum we would be in conflict with Articles 8 and 10 of the treaty.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">We would not.  The Bill is not the treaty.  The Deputy is correct to say that €11 billion is the maximum capital the Irish State can be called on to provide.  Section 3 enables the Exchequer to meet the call if it is made.  Under the treaty, if the funds are deemed to be inadequate or if inflation is rampant and the value of the fund is no longer what it was expected to be the governors can, after a unanimous decision, increase both the contribution and the amount that can be called.  However, their decision only takes effect when the individual states complete their applicable national procedures.  If a future Minister for Finance reminds us that he or she is the governor of a fund we have forgotten about and that he or she has agreed to increase our contribution by 50%, he or she will need to amend section 3 of the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 to do so.  If the Minister's amendment is rejected in the Dáil in a tight vote, one member state will not have completed its applicable national procedure and the amounts cannot be raised by the governors.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I will repeat for the Deputy the note I read to him earlier.  The capital structure of the ESM has been put in place to support the borrowing and lending activities.  If or when the ESM engages in programme funding, it will borrow money on the international financial markets and lend it to the beneficiary ESM member state.  This is how it is intended to operate.  The capital of the ESM will not be paid out directly to programme countries but will only fall to be called upon in the event that member states borrowing from the ESM default or that the ESM incurs losses in ESM operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The money we put in will not be given to Spain but will be used as collateral so that the fund can borrow to lend to Spain.  It is not a direct transfer of funds.  The call only arises if there is a default.  If there is a default I do not believe the Dáil would be kept in the dark about it because it would obviously be a major international event.  I do not see a difficulty in our requirements.  It is treated like an investment and an investment does not contribute to the deficit because there would be matching funds in the fund.  It is not reflected in the Government deficit.  It is a contingent liability on Government funding.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_137">I am well aware that the money we put in will be used as collateral.  The ESM will borrow on international markets and it will be guaranteed to get its money back.  With our money we are taking on the risk if loans go bad between the sovereign states or directly with banks if there is a proposal to lend directly to banks.  We are signing up the Irish taxpayer to taking a risk with those banks.  Earlier the Minister mentioned he would like to see direct lending to banks.  The Irish are fed up with absorbing the losses of Irish banks.  However, €100 billion was injected from the ESM directly into Spanish banks and we know Spanish banks will not be able to pay off that €100 billion without writedowns on some of their creditors, their bondholders.  The Irish taxpayer is being asked to absorb some of those losses.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_90" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_138">The Deputy is turning a hypothesis into a fact.  There is no provision within the ESM, as it is being ratified by Ireland and other states, to lend directly to banks.  Consequently, there is no possible liability to banks.  If the Spanish Government borrows €100 billion from the ESM fund, the Spanish Government carries the liability.  The only possible risk is the risk of the Spanish sovereign not being in a position to repay or refusing to repay the fund.  In all instances it will be acting for the banks.  If the situation changes and the ESM is modified with a new provision in the treaty to allow it to lend directly to banks, obviously it will all come back to us again because that will be a major change in the treaty.  Then there would be validity in the Deputy making the argument that we should get additional protection or asking what the consequences of the default of a private bank would be for a fund subscribed to by sovereign states.  At present what the Deputy is raising is a paper tiger.</p>

If that case were to exist, what he is asking the Irish taxpayers to take on is the risk that those banks would not be able to pay in full to the ESM and, therefore, the losses would be shared among the contributors to the ESM, including Irish taxpayers.</p>

People did not look forward to see how events would unfold in a year or two.  We are trying to have the most robust legislation that protects us against eventualities in the future.  I do not expect the Minister to agree we will go for a second bailout but if the international markets do not lend to us in 2014 and our contingent liability is called upon, where will we get the money?  It is a simple question.  We are signing up to a liability.  There are two sources of money, as the Minister has told us for the past four weeks, namely, the international markets and the ESM.  If the international markets lock us out and the contingent liability is called upon, we will borrow from the ESM to pay the ESM.  This is my question.  I know it is difficult for the Minister to confirm this is the reality because it is absurd that we would borrow at 3% from the ESM and pay the money to it at 0% but this is the reality.  The Minister could state other things such as that it is needed and it is a difficulty, but it will be the reality if the international markets do not lend to us, unless the Minister has the view there is another source of funding from which we can borrow to pay the ESM if the contingent liability is called upon.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">The Deputy has misinterpreted one of my earlier answers.  I never stated Ireland's contribution to the ESM if the guarantee were called in would be sourced by raising money on the international markets.  I stated the ESM will fund itself on the international markets.  The Irish capital contribution would be paid from cash resources which are managed in the normal way on behalf of the State.  There is no way one can envisage the full €11 billion being called in in one go.  One will manage it from the cash resources of the State.  The Deputy is working on the assumption that something cataclysmic will happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">In fairness, it is time for the Minister to wake up.  We are out of the international markets.  Our bond rates are sitting at 7.3%.  We will need funding in 2014 and we will need a secure source of funding by this time next year.  Spain is collapsing and its bond yields are at 7%.  It is calling for a bailout.  Italy is on the verge of it.  The Minister states I am trying to predict a catastrophe in Europe.  It is already happening before our eyes.  My question is very simple.  The Minister states we will take this from cash resources.  Do we have €11 billion in cash resources lying about which is not accounted for?</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Where the Deputy is making a mistake is in describing a catastrophe about to happen in Europe in very dramatic terms and then stating it will trigger the guarantees which Ireland will make in the treaty.  However, the ESM has not been put in place yet and it has not lent a single euro to anybody.  Nobody is guaranteeing anything.  The first up will be Spain for €100 billion.  If it applies for this and receives it, the liability of the fund will be €100 billion.  If all of the catastrophes described by Deputy Doherty occur, the fund's liability to Spain will be €100 billion and of this, even if everything was called in because of a catastrophe along the lines predicted by Deputy Doherty, it would not be the full €11 billion but a small proportion of it.  This is all I am saying.  Get real.  The Deputy is into horror stories.</p>

The Minister is asking us to sign up to a contingent liability of €11 billion for the reasons he professes.  If the international markets do not lend to us, where will we get the money to pay this liability?  It may or may never be called in.  This is why it is called a contingent liability.  However, it is prudent and right to ask from where we will get the money.  Does the Minister seriously believe we will pay it from cash reserves we have lying about and that we will not need to borrow the money from somewhere to pay it if it is called in?</p>

          <p eId="para_174">One must assume one sovereign will not get all the funds in the ESM.  This is the first assumption.  There will be a spread of risk as funds are allocated across sovereigns.  One would hope it will not all be drawn down.  It is impossible to imagine a situation where there will be a full contingent liability which would require the full drawdown of €11 billion.  In my view it is very unlikely that any European state will default because it is a strong union.  The Deputy can paint cataclysmic events for his own entertainment if he likes but I am asking him to be real about this.  I remind him that his party's policy position is to support a bailout fund for Europe.  If the Deputy supports a bailout fund for Europe, perhaps he will describe to us the architecture of the fund he proposes which would not involve contributions for contingent liabilities for the member states.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">I am not casting aspersions on the people of Spain.  God help them.  Europe is forcing ordinary citizens to bear responsibility for the determination of the European Central Bank, ECB, the Spanish Government and the European authorities to bail out the banks at all costs.  By signing up to this Bill, we would be on the hook for it as well because the ECB, Angela Merkel and company are determined that all of this must be routed through the sovereign and guaranteed by ordinary citizens.  Otherwise they will not bail out banks.  We are paying with massive austerity for the privilege of bailing out the banks.  This is the reality.  I do not know why the Minister is trying to claim otherwise.  The point I am putting to him is that in addressing Article 3 and given that the Bill's passage would put Irish citizens on the hook for up to €11 billion, it is the responsibility of the committee and the Dáil to ask about the likelihood of the €11 billion being called in and from where we would get that money.  This does not require catastrophic predictions or speculations.  It requires a reasonable assessment of what is occurring in Spain and Italy and what might occur in France.  One need not be a prophet to work out the likely sequence of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">As Spain will almost certainly require €100 billion in the first instance to recapitalise its banks, it is already facing the prospect of being locked out of the markets and may not be able to fund itself, in which case it will need even more money.  We do not know the exact figures, but there have been speculations about €200 billion, €250 billion and more.  Italy's bond yields are increasing and it may not be able to finance itself.  The ESM would be called upon to bail it out as well.  During the coming years, Italy must roll over a debt of approximately €1 trillion.  We do not know how large the problem in the French banks is, but they are likely to need assistance.  Is it not fairly likely that we will need to make the full contribution of €11 billion to the fund?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">It would not be appropriate for me to answer questions that are based on assumptions about matters in Spain, Italy and France because those are matters for the authorities in Spain, Italy and France.  It is self-evident from the section that we will enter into certain obligations, make contributions to the fund - I have already stated the amounts of the contributions - and take on a contingent liability of just over €11 billion in the event of all moneys lent by the fund being unpaid by a particular time.  There is no mystery about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">We are a country in good standing internationally.  We enter into international obligations because some problems can only be solved collectively, not individually, and particularly not by a small country.  For this reason, we are in the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and funds like the ESM.  All of these international arrangements carry obligations with them.  Many of them are legal and policy driven, but some are financial, given that we make contributions to organisations.  It is part of the way that countries are run.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">All I can do to help the Deputy is to say that, yes, the contributions I have outlined are the contributions we will make and there is a contingent liability.  That there was such a contingent liability was debated several times in the course of the referendum.  Everybody knew about it.  The ESM Bill was published in the middle of the referendum campaign to ensure the Irish public would not vote in the dark about the ESM treaty's consequences and that they would have the full facts of the treaty available to them for consideration well in advance of polling day.  I cannot help the Deputy more.  A nut fell on the head of a goose or a duck and he said the sky had fallen down.  The Deputy wants to run with the "sky has fallen down" theory.  Perhaps it will fall down.  In the meantime, however, we will get on with putting a permanent bailout fund into Europe and we will fund it in accordance with our international obligations and the treaty on which the Irish people voted, knowing that one of the consequences of a "Yes" vote was that we would ratify the ESM Bill in June.</p>

It is not simply a matter for Spain what happens there because in signing up to this, we are taking on the responsibility to bail out Spain, Italy or any other state signing up to the ESM.

          <p eId="para_239">If I understand the Minister correctly, he has said we will not be required to increase the amount of our contribution to the ESM unless we go through national procedures, or that it will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That implies we have a national veto but I must take the Minister's word on that.  It seems to be the interpretation of Article 10.  Will the Minister clarify there is no veto on the €11 billion if the ESM requires us to make the contribution?  If a simple majority of the board of governors requests we make the additional contributions up to €11 billion, we will have to do it.  There is no veto in that regard and we are seriously on the hook for the €11 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">The issue of the contributions Ireland would have to pay and the contingent liability was an integral part of the debate, arising on several occasions when people on the "Yes" side were being scrutinised in the media.  That is a fact.  The contributions are outlined in the text of the Bill, as referred to by the Deputy, and I have spelled out in detail the arrangements.  The contribution from Ireland is €1.27 billion and it must be paid in five equal instalments of €254 million.  I have described how that will be accounted for, and I need not go back over that ground.  The overall contingent liability is €11.145 billion and for that to be called in, the ESM must have loaned the full €500 billion, and that must have been defaulted on.  That seems rather unlikely but it is a contingent liability to be included.  There are all sorts of liabilities undertaken by a state when it enters into international agreements, and we have many liabilities under the European Union arising from the treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The Deputy is being alarmist and trying to scare people.  He is trying to make a political point by stretching logic to its absolute limits.  Sovereign debt - the most senior of debt - is very unlikely to have no recovery value.  If everybody defaulted together and the full €500 billion loaned to countries unknown would go down, the sovereign debt would still have some residual value.  The idea of a full call to the €11 billion figure is legally possible but it is such a remote possibility, the Deputy should not be trying to frighten people.  The campaign style of scaring the electorate did not work the last time so perhaps the tactics should change.</p>

It would mean the whole project would be gone up in smoke.  When having discussions on Committee Stage we should be more realistic about what is happening outside these Houses.

          <p eId="para_257">I put it to the Minister that the assertion is not true.  Article 10 does not deal with maintaining the capital ratio.  Article 10 of the treaty states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_258">The board of governors shall review regularly and at least every five years the maximum lending volume and the adequacy of the authorised capital stock of the of the ESM.  It may decide to change the authorised capital stock and amend Article 8 and Annex II accordingly.  Such decision shall enter into force after the ESM members have notified the depository of the completion of their applicable national procedures.  The new shares shall be allocated to the ESM members according to the contributionkeyprovided for in Article 11 and in Annex I.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I believe I am correct, and if so, I am alarmed that the Minister has made such statements today.  Article 10 of this treaty allows the ESM board of governors, through unanimous decision, to increase the firepower of the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">This is not because there are multiple defaults across the board.  Rather, it is because it would be prudent for a board of governors to question whether it is big enough.  Article 10 gives them the power to say we need additional unauthorised capital stock.  Instead of having €80 billion, they can say they want €100 billion.  Under Article 10, they have been given the power to change Article 8 and Annex II, which will call on our contingent liabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">All of this can happen without a state defaulting.  The Minister is correct in saying that if there was a default on all €500 billion, our contingent liability would automatically be called in.  That is without dispute.  The Minister is claiming the only way our contingent liability would be called in is if states default but that is not the case.  Article 10 allows the board of governors, through unanimity, to increase lending volume and deal with the adequacy of it.  They are given the power to change Annex II, which deals with the call on each member state.  I ask the Minister to clarify and correct his statement to the committee if my point is correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">That is not my understanding of Article 10.  After a five-year review, if the board of governors of the ESM decide the firewall is inadequate and that there should be a bigger firewall, they are empowered to make the decision to raise additional funds.  There is a key in the annex that gives the proportions for each state.  If they want to build a firewall of €1 billion, everyone's contribution goes up and the contingent liability of every member state increases.  If there is no default, there is no call in of liability.  We have already gone through the mechanism saying that a decision of the governors can only take effect when the member states have notified the depository of the completion of the applicable national procedures.  At the point of the decision to increase the firewall, there is no call on anyone's liability.  It is simply a decision to build a bigger firewall.  If countries are in agreement, they will make larger contributions in the future and their contingent liability will increase.  That is my understanding of it, unless I have missed something.</p>

The key was a matter of debate but a change will not happen without a total revision of the treaty and people agreeing to have a different way of allocating a proportion of contributions across the community.  The most likely thing to happen is that they will undertake a review and comment that, in the new circumstances, the firewall is inadequate and say they want to build a bigger firewall and need an extra €300 billion of lendable funds.  They increase the figures from five to eight and, to get that, every country must make a bigger contribution and give an additional guarantee in proportion to what has been already done.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I know it is fundamental but I will give it more time if Deputy Doherty addresses the following issue.  I am trying to clarify points for the progress of the committee.  As I understand it, the question Deputy Doherty is asking is about his concern about the payout.  The Minister responded that money would only be paid out in the event of multiple defaults.  After he answered that, Deputy Doherty asked about Article 10 and the power to increase.  The power to increase in Article 10 is the power to increase the contribution to the authorised capital stock.  Then, the national procedures kick in.  It is not my role to argue with Deputy Doherty but I want to see what we are now discussing.  It seems we are discussing two separate things, one of which is a new contribution to the authorised capital stock in Article 10 and the other is the concern, which Deputy Doherty pursued with the Minister over the past few minutes, about an eventuality that will arise when we must pay out in the event of multiple defaults.  These are linked but separate propositions.  We will get tied up in knots if Deputy Doherty cannot clarify for the committee where we are heading.</p>

That is clear.  We will not be called upon to pay the €11 billion because they want to increase the size of the overall lending capacity.  We will be called upon to pay up to €11 billion in the event that the countries that borrowed money from the ESM do not repay it.</p>

I am arguing that, under Article 10, the board of governors has the ability to increase the capital stock.  I understand there is a ratio in terms of the overall amount of the fund.

However, there is a provision in the treaty that the amount paid in directly by member states is 15%.  If we increase one, we increase the other.  The argument being put forward by the Minister, that the only way the contingent liabilities will be called upon is on the basis of the defaults, is inaccurate.</p>

The key is included in Annex I.  There are reasons for that because member states may decide not to pay in and the key would have to change.  The key could change but that is not the issue.  The issue is that the board of governors has the potential to increase the overall amount in the fund, which would increase our payment to the fund and it could happen without default.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Paid-in capital must be 15% of the amount lent, not the amount of the fund.  It is relevant to the accelerated payment of contributions.  While countries were building up their contributions, if the amount lent exceeded 15% of the capital paid in, we would have to accelerate payment of the contribution.  It was in that context that I explained the issue.  It does not influence the point the Deputy is making.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">There are two ways by which the contingent liability, the capital being paid in, can be called on.  The first is if there is a default on money lent to the European Stability Mechanism and the fund no longer has sufficient paid in capital.  In that scenario it would be necessary to call on the states' contingent liabilities.  The second is if the fund increases as a result of a unanimous decision of the board of governors.  As the Minister pointed out, if lending increased to a certain level, the capital would also have to be called on.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">As I have pointed out, such a scenario does not require a default by the sovereigns.  The reason this is so important is that many others and I believe the fund is not sufficiently large in the first instance given that one has Spain, France and other countries included.  At a minimum, there is significant potential for the fund to be increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">If, under Article 10, the governors decide the fund should be increased and participating countries agree to that proposition, countries will be required to make additional contributions in proportion to their current position and they will incur additional contingent liability because the size of the fund will have increased.  If the pace of lending does not match the pace of contribution to the extent that paid in capital must be 15% of the amount lent, it may be necessary to accelerate the contribution payment in order that one adheres to the 15% rule.  However, that is the only consequence.  It is true that if this scenario is realised five years from now, Ireland's contribution and liability will increase and there would also be a possibility that the pace of the additional contribution might increase as a result of the 15% rule.  There are, however, no other consequences and nothing to connect this with the calling in of the full sum of €11 billion or whatever it would be as a result of the fund having been increased in size.  That is in a different part of the forest, in other words, it is a scenario that would only arise were everybody to default.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">The position is that under the current arrangements, which I have described, and on the current level of Irish contribution and contingent liability, the ESM will be empowered to lend €500 billion.  If, in the future, a decision is taken that this sum is insufficient and the fund must be increased, it will be increased.  For example, if the figure of €500 billion were to increase to €750 billion, the increase of €250 billion would have to be funded, meaning that each member state in the fund would have to make extra contributions.  As a consequence, they would incur a proportionate increase in their contingent liabilities.  However, this liability is callable and nothing would happen to it unless it was called.  It would only be called in full if everybody were to default.  There is some confusion caused by the mixing up of two concepts.  I have tried to explain the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">This section gives the Minister legal immunity as a governor of the European Stability Mechanism once the mechanism is established following ratification of the treaty, should such ratification take place.  Will he outline the reason he desires legal immunity for the actions he may undertake as a member of the board of governors?  Why does the ESM require legal immunity?  Is the Minister disposed to waiving his legal immunity if he were required to do so?  Where is the precedent for a body such as the European Stability Mechanism and its governors, papers and premises being granted inviolability and immunity?</p>

Article 2 of the treaty sets out that the ESM shall have full legal personality and full legal capacity to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property, contract, be a party to legal proceedings and enter into a headquarter agreement and-or protocols, as necessary, for ensuring its legal status and privilege and immunities are recognised and enforced.</p>

Article 32 further sets out that the ESM, its property, funding and assets, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy immunity from every form of judicial process except to the extent that the ESM expressly waives its immunity for the purpose of any proceedings or by the terms of any contract, including the documentation of the funding instruments.  It also provides that the property, funding and assets of the ESM shall, wherever located and by whomsoever held, be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation or any other form of seizure, taking or foreclosure by executive, judicial, administrative or legislative action.  The archives of the ESM and all documents belonging to the ESM or held by it, shall be inviolable.  The premises of the ESM shall be inviolable.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The official communications of the ESM shall be accorded, by each ESM Member and by each state which has recognised the legal status and the privileges and immunities of the ESM, the same treatment as it accords to the official communications of an ESM member.  To the extent necessary to carry out the activities provided for in this treaty, all property, funding and assets of the ESM shall be free from restrictions, regulations, controls and moratoria of any nature.  The ESM shall be exempted from any requirement to be authorized or licensed as a credit institution, investment services provider or other authorised licensed or regulated entity under the laws of each ESM member.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">As the ESM is an international financial institution, the euro area member states agreed to give the ESM and those working for the ESM, such as governors, directors and so on, diplomatic privileges and immunities in line with other  international financial institutions set up by an international treaty.  The privileges and immunities are mainly in respect of diplomatic immunity, taxation and exemption from any requirement to be authorised or licensed as a credit institution investment services provider or other authorised licensed or regulated entity under the laws of each ESM member.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">A Government order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 could not address in full the privileges and immunities provided in the treaty.  Therefore, they are provided for in this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The speaking note states that immunity from legal proceedings is in respect of acts performed by them in their official capacity.  We are talking about actions by governors <i>qua</i> governors of the ESM, so it is important to state that it does not extend beyond that.  I presume it is to avoid the ESM being inhibited from acting in the manner envisaged by legal proceedings of one kind or another, whether mischievous or otherwise.  This is not unusual.  The privileges and immunities contained in the ESM treaty are similar to those in the treaties underlying the UN and the IMF.  The purpose of diplomatic privilege and immunities is not to benefit individuals or the ESM, but to ensure the effective performance of functions of the ESM.  In the case of the ESM, we believe the immunities are justified.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_331">The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  He was involved in negotiating this treaty.  I presume there was discussion about why the Minister, as a governor, may require legal immunity and why he might want to be above the law in the member states.  I understand some of the logic in his answer but why should an elected politician be above the law in any parliament?  The Minister will be above the law in this State for his duties with the ESM.  I do not think anybody should be above the law in any member state.  What kind of discussion took place around the table?  What worries did the finance ministers have that they decided to grant themselves immunity from prosecution for functions that they carry out?  We have seen in other cases involving immunity that it extends to quite frivolous activities.  Some people with diplomatic immunity are refusing to pay parking fines, speeding tickets and so on because they were attending meetings or whatever.  Therefore, I presume that the Minister's immunity can be used by claiming to be carrying out his duties as a member of the ESM board.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">When we talk about the EU, we often talk about restoring democracy and trying to go back to the people, yet this institution is being created that is above the law in every single member state.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">The ESM is potentially going to be one of the most powerful bodies in Europe that might literally hold the fate of states and the eurozone in its hands. It seems absolutely extraordinary that it would seek immunity from any sort of legal oversight by the governors or its staff as to its activities, its decisions and how it came to make those decisions, and that its archives should not be subject to scrutiny.  Essentially, it would be a law unto itself.  Why on earth would the people who are involved in negotiating the establishment of the ESM want to create this enormously powerful financial institution and ensure that it is above the law and subject to no scrutiny whatsoever at any point now or in the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_348">The net point is that the ESM is going to be the lender of last resort to sovereign states in certain circumstances in Europe.  It wants to make sure that it is not inhibited from carrying out its functions.  Sometimes it may have to carry out functions very quickly and it does not want to be inhibited by people taking legal proceedings to stop it.  We do not have to go back very far to see politicians taking legal action to prevent things occurring in this State.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, these are very important things in Europe and the future of millions of citizens may hinge on them.  If a minority party holding the Deputy's views goes to court and succeeds in stopping the ESM intervening to fund a state, and a state defaults as a result, then that is a very serious issue.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that we can envisage in modern Europe these kinds of proceedings being initiated.  It is put in specifically so that the ESM can do what it says on the tin and is not inhibited by legal actions from carrying out its functions.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">The treaty provides that within the scope of its official activities, the ESM and its assets, income, property, operations and taxation authorised by the treaty shall be exempt from all direct taxes.  ESM members shall wherever possible take the appropriate measures to remit or refund the amount of indirect tax or sales tax included in the price of movable or immovable property where the ESM makes a substantial purchase for its official use, the price of which includes taxes of this kind.  No exemption shall be granted in respect of taxes and duties on public utility services.  Goods imported by the ESM and necessary for the exercise of its official activities shall be exempt from all import duties and taxes and from all import prohibitions and restrictions.  Staff of the ESM shall be subject to an internal tax for the benefit of the ESM on salaries and emoluments paid by the ESM, subject to rules to be adopted by the board of governors.  From the date on which this tax is applied, such salaries and emoluments shall be exempt from national income tax.  No taxation of any kind shall be levied on any obligations or securities issued by the ESM, including any interest or dividend thereon by whomsoever held, which discriminates against such obligations or securities solely because of its origin, or if the sole jurisdictional basis for such taxation is the place or currency in which it is issued, made payable or paid, or the location of any office or place of business maintained by the ESM.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">I wish to raise a broader issue, if you will allow me, Chairman.  Is there any suggestion that the ESM can be used as a vehicle for the Government's efforts to renegotiate the bank debt attached to the promissory note?  Is there a potential for the ESM to be the vehicle for dealing with that?  Would the Minister like to take this opportunity to update the committee on the negotiations on the promissory note?  Is there a timeline for the completion of the technical paper?  Could the Minister give us a sense of the process?  Where will the paper be tabled once it is finally agreed by the Minister and the members of the troika?  Does the Minister view the Spanish deal as a setback for our efforts to renegotiate, given that bank debt is, regrettably, being once again heaped on the sovereign?  Can the Minister give us a sense of where that is going?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Minister has said on a number of occasions that he views the renegotiation as a medium-term project, but next March will creep up again very quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_353" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_417">We share the idea that Ireland's debt position would be more sustainable if different arrangements were made for outstanding bank debt.  The kind of arrangement we have in mind is to increase the term of various loans, principally the promissory note, to maintain a low interest rate on it and to have it for a longer period of time.  We are not talking about write-offs or restructuring in that sense.  The terms are imprecise but we are talking about a piece of financial engineering to replace short-term expensive paper with long-term inexpensive paper.  The length of time is not agreed but these are the elements of the negotiation.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">There are various difficulties.  The European Central Bank is inhibited from lending long.  At least, it is of the view that it may not have the legal authority to lend long because that might be regarded as monetary financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">It is within that scheme of things that we are exploring matters.  The Deputy can take it that all hands are on deck in Europe looking at Greece and Spain.  I would hope to commence conversations again when I get to Luxembourg next week.  The meetings are held in Luxembourg in April, June and October.  The June meetings will be in Luxembourg, in the middle of next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">An opportunity would have presented itself for Ireland if the assistance to Spain had not been tied to the sovereign but had gone directly to the banks.  There is a protocol in Europe, which is not a matter of law, that what applies to one country will apply to another, even if policy is changed at a later date.  There is an obligation, which is accepted, that if a country was treated more adversely, it should be brought retrospectively under a new protocol if a change takes place.  However, nothing happened in Spain to set us back.  It was just that there was a possibility of a new opportunity arising, and that did not occur.  There is nothing in either of the treaties, or in either of the funds, to allow direct funding to the sovereign.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">The process started as an Irish request.  The troika has now accepted the task of turning that into a policy paper which it will present to the Commission.  If the Commission, and all the rest of us, are happy with it, the Commission will table it as a Commission policy paper.  That is when it gets difficult.  The consent of 27 sovereigns is required.  That is where the political approaches have to be made.  I cannot predict what an outcome might be.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_369" as="#Minister_for_Finance">

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_439">My two questions tie together.  In terms of the renegotiation of the promissory note and the difficulty the European Central Bank has regarding long-term financing, there was talk, although I do not think it was specified, of 30-year loans in the ESM and potentially longer loans.  Could we not apply to the ESM for a loan to pay off the promissory note on a longer term?  Why could that not be secured?  It is not my preferred approach but it exists.  Spain is about to apply for a loan to pay off its banks.  We have engineered a promissory note that was wrong in its design.  Why does that option not exist?  Talks have been going on since last September.  From what I hear from the Minister there is one option on the table to which the answer is "Yes" or "No".  I do not understand why it is taking so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Second, the cost of the loans that will be provided by the ESM to member states is not clear but I understand they will be at cost with a small margin.  They are now below the IMF rate.  The IMF is lending to this State at about 4.7%; it lends to other states at different rates.  The ESM is lending at 3%.  Has the Minister entertained the thought of refinancing the €22 billion of IMF funding that has been given to this State through the ESM and the savings that would accrue of approximately €400 million per year?  Instead of the average maturity of 7.5 years we have the possibility of taking a longer-term loan out as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_442">The arrangement for the bailouts is that the European authorities, together with the IMF, will provide the financial assistance and will be involved in the monitoring of the conditionality within the programmes.  To share the burden the European authorities want the IMF involved, and therefore it is part of the structure of bailout programmes in which the IMF is involved.  For its part, the IMF will not take a lead role or act unilaterally to assist the European countries.  It will only do so if Europe takes the lead and it will come in and assist.  It is very careful about the amounts it will contribute.  As the Deputy rightly said, in the amounts of money given the IMF has its own set of rules and interest rates but it is not possible to get the Commission and the ECB to take up that portion of the programme.  That is the portion of the programme to which the IMF is committed, and the IMF provides the money on its set of conditions at its interest rate level.  When interest rates change, therefore, it is not possible to get that money elsewhere.  That is not an available option.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">On the Deputy's original question about action on the promissory note, we are not ruling out any approach.  If we could get a solution which involved the ESM, well and good.  We are prepared to examine all options but we must be very sure that the new arrangement is less onerous on the Irish taxpayer than the old arrangement.  On the primary presentation, sometimes it does not jump off the page until the numbers are worked out over a very long period of time but we are not ruling anything out.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">On a lighter note, we wish the Minister well in trying to get a better deal for Ireland in terms of the banking debt but we are somewhat gloomy about whether the approach and tactics he is employing can deliver that result.  To make a topical analogy, we are all hoping that Ireland will beat Spain tonight but we are not sure if the strength of the team or the tactics of the manager are likely to deliver that result.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">The Irish and English versions of the ESM treaty are attached to the Bill in the Schedule.  As Deputies will be aware, the treaty includes provisions on membership, the purpose of the ESM, governance authorised capital stock, operations and financial management, general provisions and traditional arrangements to apply on the move from the EFSF to the ESM.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I wish to inform the committee that I plan to bring forward on Report Stage amendments to the Irish language version of the treaty as held by the European Commission which are necessary to ensure consistency of the Irish translation of the treaty with other language translations and also to correct grammatical and typographical errors in the Irish version of the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">In the course of preparing the European Stability Mechanism Bill 2012 it has emerged that some corrections are required to the Irish language version of the treaty as held by the European Commission.  Before correcting the Irish version of the ESM treaty attached to this Bill, the Irish version of the treaty held by the European Commission had to be amended.  The method of correction is known as process verbal derectification, known to its friends as PV.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">The PV procedure is a simplified process of rectification of the text of treaties where the error being corrected is not a substantive change to the treaties and where the contracting states are agreed that there is an error which can be corrected as proposed.  It is not a procedure for amending the treaty.  In the case of EU treaties, the PV is conducted by way of written procedures where the rectification will be made once member states indicate that they have no issue with the proposed amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The procedure has been completed and the Irish version of the ESM treaty has been corrected.  The amendments I propose to bring forward on Report Stage will carry through those corrections into the copy of the treaty set out in Part 1 of the Schedule.  I am obliged, for procedural reasons, to notify members that these amendments will be coming forward on Report Stage.</p>
