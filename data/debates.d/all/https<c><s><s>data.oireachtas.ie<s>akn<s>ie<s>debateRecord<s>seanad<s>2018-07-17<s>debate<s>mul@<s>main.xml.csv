We had another disappointing day yesterday regarding Brexit. The vote narrowly passed but given the amendments by the hard Brexiters, it is becoming less likely that we will have a soft Brexit and more likely that we will have a no-deal Brexit. It is up to all of us to try to make sure that whatever happens we get the best deal for Ireland, in particular our own State but obviously the whole island of Ireland, including the North. I am not going to make any great points about the narrowness of the victories on the Brexiters' side but it may require Sinn Féin to examine its policy. On occasion it might want to go into Westminster because if the party's seven MPs had been present yesterday, the vote could have been overturned. I accept that they have a point and they make their abstentionist policy clear in advance of any election but perhaps in special circumstances such as this it might be worth considering a particular point when they may want to opt in. That is not directed at either of my colleagues to my right.

#GerryHorkan	unknown-#GerryHorkan-party	unknown-#GerryHorkan-dob	unknown-#GerryHorkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	5	We may do. A second point relates to water restrictions. We know they are necessary but Irish Water must liaise in particular with the businesses that operate in the evening time - licensed premises, restaurants, takeaways and so on. We have a thriving tourism industry and it is important that people can use facilities to wash their hands, flush toilets or get a glass of water. I call on Irish Water to contemplate easing the restrictions slightly, in particular on Friday and Saturday nights and every evening in the city centre core, for those businesses which not only contribute to the tourism economy but which provide much employment. The facilities are not just for tourists but for the entire population. They provide a lot of employment and pay a lot of taxes, including VAT, PAYE, PRSI, USC and rates and they must be catered for and considered in the restrictions. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that more than 7,000 individuals over the age of 75 were forced to wait more than 24 hours in emergency departments. It is another target that has been missed by the HSE. The service plan for 2018 requires that no patient over 75 should be waiting more than 24 hours in an emergency department.What is a fairly low bar has been missed. I call on the Leader to bring the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to the House - I appreciate that will not be done today - to outline what is being done in that regard. I welcome that those involved in an insurance fraud in which €60,000 in damages was sought by several people for whiplash injuries in a collision involving a Hertz rental car have been directed to pay €23,000 for expenses incurred in the investigation of the claim. We should bring forward legislation to allow for those people to be prosecuted for fraud and be subject to fines and jail time, which would discourage false claims. All Members want people to be able to pursue legitimate claims but false claims must be discouraged. A public consultation on BusConnects was launched yesterday and will continue until 28 September. It is unfortunate that it is taking place during the summer period, when many people will be on holiday or not focused on the impact of bus timetables on work or school schedules and so on. However, I ask that people examine the plans that are in place. Many of the measures are to be welcomed but problems will be caused in certain areas and some people will have genuine concerns. I ask those with concerns or observations of a positive nature to contribute to the consultation process. I wish all those with whom I have worked in the Seanad over the past couple of years, and particularly those on my panel, a very happy summer. I hope they will take plenty of rest, not work too hard and come back refreshed. We will see everybody in September, if not before.

#IanMarshall	unknown-#IanMarshall-party	unknown-#IanMarshall-dob	unknown-#IanMarshall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	9	The past week was very significant for Northern Ireland and, in particular, the United Kingdom. That was not due to the visit of Donald Trump, by which we were hugely honoured, but, rather, the week of parades in Northern Ireland. I thank and pay tribute to the Minister of State for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, who attended a parade in Belfast, at which he was warmly welcomed and received. For him to represent Ireland at the event was a significant gesture on his behalf and that of the State. The great significance of the presence of the Tánaiste in Derry after the violence and trouble that erupted there must also be noted, as must the presence of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald in the city to try to deal with some of the issues and calm the situation. The most striking and important event of last week was the presence of the former captain of the Irish rugby team and the British and Irish Lions at a parade in Loughgall. A video featuring him playing a Lambeg drum later went viral on social media. That was a clear indication that such gestures, which many may consider tokenistic, make a difference. We must break down the barriers and get more people from the South to go North for parades week. It is a week of holidays and relaxation for both the nationalist and unionist communities. I left Leinster House last Thursday, 12 July, to drive through Belfast to Antrim for a radio interview. When I left Dublin that morning, the newspapers were filled with images of very violent scenes in Belfast and Londonderry, which was disappointing. However, all was peaceful as I drove through Northern Ireland. The roads were very quiet because it was a bank holiday. The temperature was good and the sun was shining. The reality North of the Border was completely different from the images of it portrayed globally. As a Northern Irish citizen, I find such coverage hugely disappointing. I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Horkan on Brexit. I am deeply concerned by where the Brexit talks are going. The clock is ticking and the sands of time are running out but there are more questions than answers. I am very concerned that our fears are increasing rather than decreasing. It is important that a deal be struck. No deal for the North of Ireland is not an option. A deal must be struck and a resolution found for the many problems in that regard. It is a good time to reflect and consider that Brexit involves more problems than answers. Perhaps the decision to leave the European Union should be revisited.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	10	In response to the points made by Senator Horkan, I wish to make clear that Sinn Féin is an abstentionist party. Its voters choose to elect abstentionist MPs and people in the North voted to reject Brexit. Both those mandates must be respected. I note the newfound concern of several Members of this House in regard to Westminster elections in the North. If they feel that strongly about it, they should put themselves before the people of the North and seek a mandate. The British Government must keep its political promise to give legal effect to the backstop in the North. That arrangement is absolutely necessary in the talks going ahead. It is a very concerning time for all involved. Senators should rest assured that Sinn Féin will continue to do everything it can to ensure that the rights of Irish citizens in the North are protected and that jobs and enterprises in this State are also protected. I raise the issue of the failure of the Government to protect subcontractors, in particular in light of the Carillion collapse. It is obvious that the Government could have dealt with this matter under Article 71.3 of EU directive 2014/24/EU, which provides for subcontractors to be paid directly by the contracting authority. The Government was utterly negligent in failing to include that provision when the directive was transposed into Irish law. That failure, along with the lack of proper due diligence in the selection of the main contractor during the procurement process, means the Government cannot now ignore the plight of subcontractors left without payment for work carried out and equipment supplied to schools. More than 60 such businesses have been robbed of approximately €14 million in total. These businesses and hundreds of jobs across the country are at risk because those protections were not provided. Why did the Government not include the provision for subcontractors to be paid directly by the contracting authority when the directive was transposed? Was it not concerned about the risk to those businesses, which form the backbone of our economy, and the hundreds of job losses that may arise? Furthermore, the Government must formally hold KPMG, the auditor of Carillion, to account for assessing the company as financially suitable. The Carillion accounts were signed off and endorsed by KPMG, which has questions to answer. The Government must ensure those questions are answered. We should not expect students and teachers to return to schools in September when payment has not been made for the school buildings or equipment. The Department of Education and Skills, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the Government must ensure that payment is made for outstanding equipment and buildings and that the certification of works to meet building regulations involves those who carried out the work. There are many aspects to this issue. We should not put students, parents or teachers in the predicament of having to take advantage of businesses which were undermined by the lack of protection afforded by the Government.

Senators will have noted that it is particularly overloaded, with eight Bills to be dealt with today. I acknowledge that is not the fault of the Leader or the Seanad but it is bad legislative practice that a large amount of legislation must be dealt with in one day at the end of every summer term, while at other times of the year there is very little legislation with which to deal. We support the Leader in any representations he may wish to make to his party Whip or the Dáil Business Committee with regard to the timing of legislation coming before the Seanad. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on Brexit. I echo the concerns expressed by Senators about the effect of the votes in the House of Commons yesterday on the relatively positive step forward represented by the White Paper of the Prime Minister, Theresa May, which at least indicated a shift in British Tory policy from a hard to soft Brexit.The votes yesterday, and the question they raised over whether a backstop remains in place in respect of the British Government's position, have resulted in British policy being as much of a fiasco as President Trump's performance at the Helsinki press conference yesterday. We see such a lack of clarity about what the British Government is seeking or will be mandated by Westminster to seek. I listened to Senator Conway-Walsh's comments but it is somewhat rich of Sinn Féin to say that it will do everything it possibly can to ensure the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland are protected when it will not take up its seats at Westminster. It would have a much better opportunity there to protect the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland and to have an input into the shape of Brexit, which is of such concern to us all. I ask the Leader for a debate on that early in the next term. I wish all my colleagues well for the summer break but ask them to take the opportunity to call into the Seanad anteroom if they cannot come to the launch of the Vótáil 100 exhibition. It is opening on Thursday this week at 2 p.m. in the anteroom. It is entitled, Votes for Women: Suffrage and Citizenship, and it will be a great exhibition. We are going to have exhibits including the original banner used by the Irish Women's Franchise League, a lectern used by suffrage speakers bearing the words "Votes for Women" and medals awarded to Ms Hanna Sheehy Skeffington. The exhibition is being run in conjunction with the National Museum and the Sheehy Skeffington family. As Chair of the Vótáil 100 committee, I thank my colleagues on the committee for all their work. We are travelling to Westminster tomorrow as well to present a portrait of Ms Constance Markievicz to the Speaker of the House there, if the Parliament is still functioning tomorrow. That is an historic occasion.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	14	I second and agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ian Marshall with respect to all the events over the past few days in Northern Ireland. I refer to the positive events as well as those of a sadder nature, which, as Senator Marshall correctly said, do not reflect the full picture but are in themselves a difficulty that needs to be dealt with. I endorse his words in respect of Northern Ireland. He made the point succinctly and there is no merit in repetition. I ask the Leader to ensure a debate early in the new term on an issue which I ask him to convey to the Minister for Health as a matter of urgency in the interim. We have a stated policy, correctly, across the health system that we treat people, in so far as is possible, in their own home. That is how it should be, that is where people in general want to be and it is where they should be. Not only is it efficacious in respect of their life and well-being but it is also an economically sound proposition. It is a much cheaper option than people being in nursing homes, etc.  There is a difficulty of which I want the Leader to be cognisant. There is a shortage of home helps to fill allotted home help hours throughout the country. We need to train more home helps. The HSE in many instances is using agency personnel to fill these gaps and the difficulty is that those personnel are passing through- they are not always available. We are going to have to make home help a career within the HSE so that people will work for a certain number of hours per week and are registered within the HSE. This has happened in the past with great effect but it is ceasing to happen.  We also need to encourage more people into the training system because there is a dearth of home helps to fill the necessary hours and in some instances a lack of hours allocated, which is also wrong. There is no point in platitudinously saying we believe in care within the home and we believe in a community health system unless we back it up with availability of home helps, an education course for them and a career structure that makes it attractive, particularly in this age of nearly full employment. It is a crucial question and I appeal to the Leader to ensure that it is dealt with immediately while we await a debate in September. 
#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	15	I would like to raise two or three issues, the first of which is healthcare. If we look back at this term, we have discussed healthcare more than anything else. I refer also to housing. Those are two critical issues. I have said repeatedly that this Government has achieved much. It will be judged, however, on the provision of healthcare and affordable housing - social, private purchase or whatever - for our people. We need to build a better health service, one valued by all of our people, which provides safe and high quality healthcare and personal social services for the population of Ireland. Something we have to be mindful of is that no one particular group has a monopoly over the policy but we have to focus on and drill down into policy more. I know we have had the Minister in here on a number of occasions and I hope the Leader might address this when we come back after the summer.  I could not let this opportunity go on the our final day without mentioning the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH. I plead with all the Members to use whatever political contacts they have, in government or outside, and with their respective health spokespersons and parties to put pressure on the Government to reopen the remaining six beds. Staff at the hospital are in regular contact with my office about that. They are asking what is happening. I have contacted the Minister for Health on a number of occasions and I have contacted the Taoiseach's office directly twice in the past few weeks. Nothing seems to be happening. This is the NRH service. These patients are in hospitals right across the country holding up beds. There were 12 beds and we got six open in a slow process. I appeal to everyone to try to get these remaining six beds open.  I turn now to affordable housing. Today in The Irish Times, Mr. Fiach Kelly has an article on the front page which talks about the establishment by the Government - I think tomorrow - of a national regeneration and development agency, NRDA. One of the targets mentioned in the article is that this agency will be given the task, along with the requisite equipment and funding, of acquiring private lands. I am making an appeal to all people involved in politics. We know vast tracts of land are in State ownership in the docks areas, along the railway network and in all 31 local authority areas. There are thousands of acres and many of them are zoned for housing but perhaps not serviced, which is the issue. It would be wholly inappropriate and wrong to start using more taxpayers' money to acquire more private land for housing.  I ask the Leader if we could have a debate about the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, annual report which we all received about two weeks ago in the post. In the report NAMA tells us that it offered 6,984 residential units to the State and the local authorities. Only 2,717 attracted positive expressions of interest. We have to ask NAMA and the Government, in respect of its policy, why we have 7,000 residential units empty and supposedly available to address housing. Why have we, as the primary owners of NAMA, not brought those into play? Finally, I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the staff who serve the Seanad, the Leader and the Leader's office - and particularly Ms Orla Murray - for their support for all of us during this term. I wish everyone an enjoyable, restful summer recess.

It suffered greatly four and a half months ago when we had snow and a terrible winter before that. We are now looking at six and half weeks of drought. In my part of the world there is an issue with fodder and how the agriculture industry will survive the winter. A major debate is required on how farmers will finance the unfortunate major expenses they have. I also believe we have to look at the numbers of animals we have on farms.Perhaps it is time we looked at reducing the dairy herd by 1% or 2% so we can keep enough fodder for winter. There is a real issue regarding the mental health of farmers. Farmers are very much feeling the pain at the moment. I was at a show last Saturday and I was shocked by the view farmers had running into the winter. It is still only July. They were wishing their lives away. They were planning six months ahead and they did not know how they would survive. The pressure on the agricultural sector is a huge issue. We cannot wait until September to provide the care the farming community requires. The conversation on the mental health issue needs to start now. We need to move it forward. I will mention another issue. I condemn the attack during the week on the former leader of Sinn Féin, Deputy Adams, in Northern Ireland. It has to be condemned by all sides of the House. Such actions are totally inappropriate. We need to note that when Senator Mulherin's office was firebombed by a member of the same party, Deputy Adams did not condemn it and did not want to go to meet the person who did it or the person who was firebombed. Deputy Adams cannot be crying out at this stage when one looks at what happened to my colleague who is sitting behind me.

I will raise the issue of University Hospital Limerick again. I raised the issue six weeks ago and I highlighted the horrendous happenings to staff in the hospital. I asked the Minister to investigate. Regrettably, the Minister's investigation consisted of a letter asking the hospital if there was a problem. The hospital, funnily enough, wrote back saying no, there is nothing to see here. I was inundated by calls from doctors, nurses and support staff expressing their concerns and their relief that someone had raised the terrible issue of bullying and the anti-union, union-busting agenda in University Hospital Limerick. The shop steward I referred to, who has been forced out of work since April, still cannot return to work. He has done nothing wrong. Hospital management refuses to go to the Workplace Relations Commission on the matter. It is quite shocking for a public body such as University Hospital Limerick to adopt such an approach. He is horrified. My union, SIPTU, and I are very clear that there is an anti-union agenda by management and an attempt to break the union. A second example came to me this week and I met the person concerned. I will not mention any names. The most horrific letter was received by this member of staff. I cannot repeat most of it because it is so graphic in detail. One line towards the end, written to this person who worked on a ward in the hospital, said "We all hate ye on this ward ye sad stupid headcases so we won’t tell ye again [to] get out ye are not wanted in this ward or anywhere". They go on to say, "f--- away each other and get out of here and go to hell". They attached a pornographic image to the letter. The person who received this letter still has not had a meeting with the human resources department. That was in February so it is five months later. This member of staff wrote to the Minister. I regret to say the Minister has not intervened. There is much more to come from University Hospital Limerick. The Minister may regret his decision not to undertake a thorough investigation. I appeal to the Government to have a close look at what is happening. There is a horrendous culture of bullying, intimidation, an anti-union agenda, and it comes from the very top of management in University Hospital Limerick. I am asking the Leader for a debate as soon as we come back on this urgent issue.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	22	I have highlighted the problem the environmental designation of land under the habitats directive and the birds directives is having west of the Shannon and particularly the fact it is shutting down development. If a person wants to dredge a river to stop flooding, build a road or bridge, put up a fence or widen a drain, he or she is blocked from doing so. With regard to roads and bridges, it is adding such delay and cost - I am talking about millions - that the existing situation is just not tenable. I ask that as well as having a general debate on the issue in the House as a priority in September, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under whose remit this falls, is asked that in the case of infrastructural development near special areas of conservation or special protection areas, where development has taken place in or about these designated lands, what surveys, investigation or studies have been done to establish the impact of development on designated sites and to what extent protected species, habitats and birds have re-established themselves on or near sites after a development has been carried out. I will give an example of a farmer outside Castlebar who developed a small wind farm on his lands. One of the turbines was objected to by the National Parks and Wildlife Service because of the presence of grouse. The man has since built it. There are turbines elsewhere. The grouse have established themselves at the base of the turbines. We are constantly being told in Mayo we cannot proceed with the development of a bridge or road because of freshwater pearl mussel. There are Government schemes to support freshwater pearl mussel and all the other species and habitats. It seems to me there are more freshwater pearl mussel in the county of Mayo than there are wild mushrooms. As we move forward, if we are to make real progress and not assault the environment, we have to get the balance between wildlife and people. If not, we might as well turn Ireland west of the Shannon into a game reserve for people to come and have a look at us and see how we exist because we are going nowhere fast. As far as I am concerned, it is a priority. I know other colleagues feel similarly. It is something we should look at with fresh eyes come September.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	23	We had a very passionate debate in 2017. The Leader was probably one of the most passionate people in the Chamber when we discussed local government boundaries. The Leader explained to the House exactly what happened in his constituency as a result. Rathmines is an urban village which used to have its own town council which met in Rathmines Hall. It has been divided in half by the Boundary Commission. It is one community split with a line drawn through it. It ignores that Rathmines is an urban village. I very much regret that. I spent yesterday afternoon in Dublin Port. I was looking at the increased level of business related to exports, which is very welcome. They are well ahead of forecasts this year. They will be about 8% ahead of forecast. Brexit is a real problem coming up. We talk in the abstract. How will we handle 8 km of articulated lorries held in Dublin Port for up to three and four hours? At the weekend it was announced that the national oil reserves had to be moved out of the UK to be brought back to Ireland or stored in other European countries. There is talk of an additional 500 customs personnel being employed. It is quickly becoming a reality. Many party leaders, including my own party leader, Deputy Howlin, have spent an awful lot of time travelling to the UK to talk to our colleagues there and the SDLP in the North, and consulting our PES sister parties across Europe, trying to ensure we support the Minister's efforts on Brexit. It is important that all parties in the House play a role in ensuring that support. Senator Bacik mentioned Countess Markievicz.The portrait of Countess Markievicz is hung in Westminster but unfortunately we do not have a voice in Westminster to fight for the island of Ireland. I do not accept the idea that we are an abstentionist party because they abstain from government in Dublin-----

I have done business in the North since 1990 and I never found myself in a situation where I felt that I was in trouble. Any time I travelled overseas during the mid-1980s, I was always asked about the war going on in the North of Ireland. The media are seeking sensationalism. I agree with the speakers who have called for the Tánaiste to come into the Seanad as soon as possible when we come back in September to discuss the Brexit issue. There are fears, particularly in the agrifood sector, which is a major part of Kildare's industry, about the many exports going to the UK. I ask that we have a debate on Seanad reform. I know there is almost a secret society with Senator McDowell that no one ever hears reports about. I have some historical facts. In 1920, the law was brought in to set up the Senate. It convened in 1921. In 1922, the Free State set up its own Seanad and many who were already Senators in 1920 and 1921 were part of that. Those are a few milestones. I hope that we will have some Seanad reform. As a new Senator, I thank the staff in the Seanad Office for all the help and assistance that they have given me since I was elected, and I wish my colleagues a happy holiday. Enjoy it and be back for the turmoil, excitement and debate that takes place in this austere House in September.

From this time last year, the prices of daily produce, such as bread, butter, fish and foodstuffs generally, have increased in price according to the latest consumer price index. The price of electricity has gone up by 9.2% from this time last year. One of the biggest increases was in the price of home heating oil. It is up a staggering 29.4% compared to June last year. In practical terms, that means that someone purchasing 1,000 l of home heating oil this time last year would have spent €550 and it would cost €712 today for the same 1,000 l. That is continuing to increase. I raise that because, with the Government now in negotiations on the budget, the social welfare payments and fuel allowance have to reflect the price that consumers find here. Many people are struggling to survive. The farming sector is facing what it calls the perfect storm this year. We have had a very poor spring, a shortage of fodder as we speak, and a continuing drought. The Government set up a task force earlier in the year to look at the fodder crisis. I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine re-establish that task force because I have serious concerns that the farming sector is going to face the biggest crisis it has ever experienced. The Government needs to get a grip on it. Do not leave it too late. It is time to re-establish that task force and consult with the farming organisations so that a proper plan can be put in place to address the serious problems that face us down the road.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	35	This week is farm safety week. I offer my sympathies to the family of the farmer who died in Galway yesterday. Some 24 farmers died last year in farm accidents. My colleague, Senator Conway, put a fine document about farm safety together in the Seanad Public Consultation Committee. We need to keep it to the forefront of our minds. I will be positive today. WP Engine is bringing jobs to Limerick. It is having a recruitment day in Flannery's Bar in Limerick today and Slattery's Bar in Dublin on 19 July. Those are all high-end jobs. I encourage people who are interested in recruitment in the mid-west to visit these jobs fairs because quite a number of jobs are on offer. On a positive note, last weekend was very good for sport in Limerick. Ciara Neville and her team mates won a silver in the World U20 Championships in Athletics. Niall Herlihy came first in the Irish Rowing Championships. He came from Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, where I am chairperson of the board of management. I wish him all the best. Castleconnell Boat Club won three pots, five silver medals and three bronze medals in championship rowing, and eight gold medals in non-championship rowing. The hurlers beat Kilkenny last weekend and go on to the semi-final at the end of July, against Cork. I know the Leader is from Cork and I am sure we will meet on the day in Croke Park. Sport is a positive thing to be involved in, with the friendships and camaraderie that people have through sport, particularly team sports.

Let us be grateful and thankful to the people of Ireland for the referendum on the eighth amendment. Mná na hÉireann have more autonomy over our bodies and choices. Well done to Senator Black and all of us on voting for the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 last week. Unfortunately, there are negatives which have been stark and shocking. The first and foremost for me was the CervicalCheck scandal. Emma Mhic Mhathúna, who is now gravely and seriously ill, is asking for laboratories and cytologists to make free their time. She is spending the money that was awarded to her, when she is gravely ill, to try to help the women of Ireland. As she said, we need to do it so the scandal of the 3,000 not yet read or audited will never happen. Last year, on 20 July, I stood in this Chamber before recess and talked about Linn Dara. I said I would keep talking about it until something happened. Something happened in October. The 11 beds that were closed in the Linn Dara inpatient unit were opened. That was about time. Unfortunately, the day programme is now closed, with the same tactics and ideas of just shutting down vital services for the children of this country, for their well-being and their mental health. When do we ever learn? I thank the HSE staff and those working in chaotic conditions. We need their shoulder to the wheel. Please stick with the HSE until we revolutionise it. I thank the staff of this House for the smooth management, their absolute understanding and putting us right when we go wrong. I guess they are glad to see the back of us for a while.

The presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, at the Orange march in Belfast was hugely significant. It follows on from the presence of Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, at the Ulster final in Clones and the visits of many royal couples to Ireland. There is a new stage in our evolution. I certainly will not take a lecture from anyone from Dublin about my feelings on Northern Ireland. I come from middle Ireland and the party of Garret FitzGerald, which introduced the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which supports the Good Friday Agreement. There are two sides to every story on the island of Ireland and in the UK. We must work much more closely with our neighbours on all sides to ensure we get peace and a better country.

Today, the electoral commission has fined the Vote Leave campaign £61,000 and referred it to the police for breaking electoral law. This is as a result of the Brexit referendum. What is happening in the House of Commons is very worrying. The UK has to abide by its joint report commitments, that is, the backstop. Negotiations cannot progress and there can be no transition or withdrawal agreement otherwise. The Good Friday Agreement has to be agreed in all its parts. Our fate is now being decided by people in the United Kingdom who have no interest in either Ireland or the Good Friday Agreement. That is a matter of some concern. We must unite to ensure that our interests are protected. They are not thinking about the United Kingdom but about uniting the Tory Party, which is very damaging. I know it is a UK decision but we must have a second referendum. We are going in a certain direction that is going to be damaging for the island of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the EU. It is up to the British people but a referendum is needed after all the shenanigans that have happened in the past few days.
#GraceOSullivan	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-party	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-dob	unknown-#GraceOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	45	Last week, on 11 July, the country was amazed to discover a wealth of historic sites surrounding Newgrange in Brú na Bóinne. On that same day, Providence Resources completed its dangerous seismic survey of the Newgrange Prospect off the south-west coast of Ireland. That area, with its many blue whales, fin whales, dolphins, coral reefs, mackerel, tuna and many other fish species, has been subjected to seismic testing at least three times in the past few years without a single environmental impact assessment or stage 2 appropriate assessment. These tests took place in 2013, 2014 and 2016 and now again in 2018. No cumulative assessment of the damage has ever been conducted. This time last year, the Government granted permissions to drill for oil off the south-west coast in the ecologically sensitive suite of the Porcupine Basin just as the Dáil closed for the summer recess. Once again as per usual, oil companies exploited the lack of democratic accountability for their own gain. The new archaeological discovery at Brú na Bóinne was due to the most extreme heatwave Ireland has experienced since 1976. It was a happy accident in an uneasy period of beautiful sunshine but severe drought, just one more addition to the freak weather events that have become a regular occurrence in recent years. I want the relevant Minister to give a commitment to this House that no drilling will happen off the Irish coast this summer. I want him to pay heed to the passing of our motion for marine protected areas and state that he will not be held in thrall by lobbyists throwing every penny of PR money that they can at the Department, securing nothing for the Irish State but the destruction of our environment and our children's future.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	46	I join colleagues in thanking Martin Groves and the staff of the Seanad office for all the assistance they have given us in recent months. Budget time is approaching. There is going to be a lot of discussion of Estimates in the coming months and the Government will be trying to frame a budget that will keep our economic prosperity on track. There is one issue about which we need to have a fundamental conversation, namely, VAT. As we know, the 9% VAT rate is very good for tourism and I sincerely hope it continues. I would like a 9% rate to be introduced in other areas in order to stimulate other parts of the economy. I would also like to see the Government examine the threshold at which a self-employed individual has to register for VAT. At the moment, a self-employed plumber, carpenter or other person providing services has to register for VAT if their turnover is €37,500 or more. This needs to be revised upwards. The figure of €37,500 is around €600 a week. I think it is unreasonable and unfair. It creates considerable red tape and also encourages people to operate in the black market. They do so to keep their figure down and avoid incurring the various costs associated with having to register for VAT. In a modern, developing and growing economy, we should increase the threshold to €50,000. Even at that, it is not a significant jump. It would help people regularise their affairs, reduce red tape and certainly would encourage people not to operate 20% or 30% of their business on a cash basis in the black market. People might be of the view that it is not of pressing importance but given that we are trying to encourage craftsmen and tradesmen to come back from abroad and set up businesses here, we need to put a suite of incentives in place. I am calling on the Minister for Finance to seriously consider this over the coming months. I ask the Leader to write to the Minister expressing this view, which has been articulated on the Order of Business in the Seanad. I wish my colleagues a very pleasant summer break. To those who are watching and listening to our deliberations, I encourage them to swim in designated areas where there are lifeguards and to be careful because we do not want any tragedies over the summer. We have had too many of them. I thank colleagues for their courtesy and support.

It is good that Ireland is doing so. We played a key role in the negotiation of the sustainable development goals and have a key responsibility to show leadership and ownership in driving forward the integration of those goals into national and international strategies and policies. Unfortunately, however, the indications are that Ireland is not doing as well as it should be. It is important to acknowledge this in order that we might more forward. Social Justice Ireland has highlighted that Ireland is falling short on its ambition in terms of many of the social justice goals including measures on equality, labour rights protection and others. Climate Action Network Europe has highlighted that Ireland is dragging close to the bottom of the league in terms of delivering on its climate change and other commitments.If we have sustainable development goals, we must translate them into action. I was concerned to hear my colleague, Senator Mulherin, express concern about the dredging of rivers and the burden of the birds directive. The flooding we have experienced has been linked in many cases to the lack of proper environmental protection assessments before irresponsible building was allowed to take place in previous eras. The way in which that building was done contributed to environmental damage. Senator Mulherin talked about measuring the return of species after development but in this House the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht refused to introduce baseline research. She refused to accept amendments to the terrible and destructive Heritage Bill 2016, which would have provided for a baseline to know where our environment was before development and to provide a context for the decisions we make. As Senator Grace O'Sullivan pointed out, it is concerning that the seismic activities taking place off our shores were happening without environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment. We have had good moments across the Houses, including Deputy Pringle's Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill, which I look forward to sponsoring and supporting with many others when it comes to the House in the autumn. We also had the anti-fracking Bill. These are good moments and we need to follow through on them. We have not called for an amendment to the Order of Business because we know it may not happen today. However, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide the House with assurances that over the summer drilling will not commence off the south-west coast. Sustainable development is not a burden. It is a matter of rebalancing and thinking differently and in a more joined-up fashion. There have been some most positive initiatives such as the greenway and cycleway in Mayo, the Food on the Edge festival in Galway, the wonderful Cuan Beo Festival, which seeks to link sustainable communities with sustainable environments, and the Cruinniú na mBád festival this August. They are examples of communities seeking to live and grow sustainably, which is our future if we are to have one for small towns and communities around Ireland that is in tune with our environment. Let us not look at environmental assessments and the birds directive as a burden; let us look at them as an opportunity to rethink and to do things better. I wish Members a happy summer. I hope they will get to some of the wonderful small festivals which are taking place in so many communities throughout the country.

I agree with Sinn Féin that there is no doubt that they will be glad to see the back of us for a couple of months. My second point is more technical. Typically, the Seanad finishes a week after the Dáil. It might be worthwhile to see if there is any way they can be coterminous in their interaction on Bills. We have a large number of Bills coming through at the very end, which is typical of any session. However, we might consider whether there is a way in future to make changes so that things happen in an easier way than is typical at the end of term.

I hope we come back to a session in which there is respect for conscience voting. I want to see less of the brutal imposition of the party Whip on issues. I hope also that we will scrutinise proposals thoroughly and properly and not just jump on bandwagons as happens here from time to time. A good example of what I mean was the original proposal for a straightforward deletion of Article 41.2, the clause of the Constitution referring to women's work in the home and their not being obliged by economic necessity to work outside the home. At the Constitutional Convention, 90% of participants voted against an outright deletion and to replace it with something gender neutral. Initially, the Government floated the idea that it would delete the provision simpliciter and the Taoiseach engaged in all sorts of spin-doctored references to how sexist and patriarchal it all was. However, that was without a more considered reflection on what the provision was supposed to be about in the first place. It was included in the Constitution at a time of considerably more poverty than exists in the country now and when there was a real social good in at least aspiring to the idea that mothers in the home would not be forced to work outside it. The first issue we need to consider is how the provision received nothing but lipservice over the years. We saw with the tax individualisation measure some years ago how little value successive Governments have placed on the care being provided by parents in the home. While I am glad the Government has pulled back and there will be further consideration of what needs to be done, I ask why there was major flag-flying about straight deletion without any consideration here, as opposed to within the Constitutional Convention, of what should be included in the Constitution. There is a great deal more we need to do to value the parenting taking place in the home, whether by fathers or mothers. I hope we will have a more reflective politics on foot of the announcement of a different way of proceeding on that issue. I intend to table an amendment to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill later. Committee and Remaining Stages are scheduled and I intend to raise a matter on Committee Stage at the very least which may well be the subject of an amendment on Report Stage. Can the Leader reassure me that there will be no obstacle to my tabling of such an amendment if I can find support for it? I understand from the officials in the House that it will not be possible.

At the end of the political term, it is important to reflect on where we are and where we are going. As others have done, I wish everyone across the Chamber a rest over the summer months, most importantly the staff who have facilitated us every day we are here. Democracy is very important. Any of us watching television last night, whether it was the Brexit debate in Britain or what happened in Helsinki between Trump and Putin, will have realised that democracy is very fragile. In these Houses at least, we should always say to ourselves that, whatever arguments we may have, left and right, we have an opportunity here to do a great deal of good when we work together. We should never underestimate the importance of that. Democracy is not something we can take for granted and we should never be complacent about it. We should never assume we will always have it in Ireland and we must work every day to ensure people believe in it and in our democratic institutions. People should believe their Parliament, local authorities and politicians work for them. When we see what is happening across Europe, the United States and Britain, we should be proud of what we are achieving in this Oireachtas. Our country is wounded and we are coming out of a very difficult time. While we have made improvements and can, hopefully, look to the future, my brief experience here since 2011 suggests that politics works best when we work together. There have been great examples of that from every party and Independent in the Houses. I hope everyone enjoys their rest and I look forward to working with and, indeed, against certain people when we come back in September.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	70	I thank the 21 Members who spoke on the Order of Business for their contributions and begin by addressing the joint issues of Brexit and the North of our country.In response to Senators Horkan, Marshall, Conway-Walsh, Bacik, Humphreys, Lawlor, Devine and Feighan, Brexit is of absolute importance to us on an all-island basis. I agree with Senator Feighan and I hope that the UK will reconsider and hold a second referendum if they have time. Government continues to take an all-Ireland approach to Brexit. I agree with Senator Feighan that the fines imposed on two organisations campaigning for the UK to leave are highly significant. As Senator Ó Ríordáin said ní neart go cur le chéile - we do well when we come together. It is important to recognise that, as Senator Conway-Walsh said, the issue of the backstop has not gone away. Tomorrow the Tánaiste will bring a position paper to Cabinet. The Government is on high alert over Brexit. A huge amount of work has taken place across Government and Government agencies. A range of Government supports have been put in place, including the Brexit loan scheme, the low-cost loan scheme for agribusiness and additional funding to State agencies. Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland have introduced the Start to Plan voucher. The Government has been very proactive in putting in place a platform to get its information across to Irish citizens, business and representative bodies, along with building alliances across Europe and putting in place structures to carry out work that is necessary in our preparedness for Brexit. The Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Taoiseach are fully committed to ensuring we have the best outcome for Ireland in our Brexit negotiations. It is important to recognise that it is about all parts of our island. I note that my friends from Sinn Féin seem to get very alarmed when Members of this House speak on matters of the North and matters of Brexit. It is our entitlement to speak. We are legislators and Members of the Oireachtas. I fully agree with Senator Feighan, as a member of the Fine Gael Party which put forward the Anglo-Irish Agreement and which upholds the Good Friday Agreement. It is important to recognise that Sinn Féin had an abstentionist policy in these Houses of the Oireachtas and it revisited that. I say to the Sinn Féin Members present today that they should not take it as a personal criticism; they should take it as a criticism that we now have no voice representing nationalists or moderate unionists in the House of Commons.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	76	It is important that we all wear the green jersey and take away our partitionist or narrow focus, if that is the case. I join Senator Marshall in commending the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, on his attendance at last week's parade. Gestures matter. Symbols and symbolism form one part of the debate. The gesture made by Brian O'Driscoll and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, is about building bridges, reconciliation and creating a new Ireland where all of us are equal and welcome and where all traditions are recognised. I agree with Senator Marshall that it was disappointing that the minority got the coverage as opposed to the majority who were having a peaceful day. I also condemn the attacks on any member of society, Deputy Adams or anybody else. They have no place in a modern, civilised society. Senator Horkan raised the issue of Irish Water and the night-time economy. He makes a very good point. I know Irish Water has been communicating and engaging with people on the issue of water. I hope a sensible approach will be taken for the hospitality sector, which at this peak time requires certain amounts of water usage. The Senator made reference to the health system and those over 75. He will have noticed that there are 13% fewer people on trolleys than this time last year. While we have a significant journey to take, it is important to recognise that we are investing more in our health system than ever before. I join Senator Horkan in commending Hertz on its pursuit of people making fraudulent claims. Such claims increase insurance premiums for many people. It is important that we call them out and the Senator's points are very valid. His points about the summertime consultation on BusConnects are valid. I hope people will engage, not least because we now have social media and mobile devices. People sitting by a swimming pool can still engage and I hope they will. It is an important consultation. I believe I have addressed Senator Marshall's comments. I commend him on his contribution on the Order of Business today. Senator Conway-Walsh raised the very important issue of the Carillion subcontractors working on school building projects. It is a huge source of concern. Subcontractors need to be protected. In many cases small family businesses have not been paid significant amounts of money, which is unacceptable. As Members know, the Department is not in a legal contract with the subcontractors, whose contracts are with Carillion and Sammon, which have both gone into liquidation. There is ongoing negotiation and I hope the court-appointed liquidator can bring a resolution. I agree with the Senator that the role of subcontractors and their relationship with the main contractor need further examination. I do not think she is correct in saying the Government is negligent in that regard. It is important to recognise that Carillion was paid and it paid Sammon for that bundle of schools. Senators Bacik and Kieran O'Donnell spoke about the scheduling of the House. We have often sought and have achieved getting legislation commenced in this House. Of course, the Seanad almost always rises after the Dáil. Senator O'Donnell's points are worth pursuing. I join Senator Bacik in wishing her and our other colleagues from this House, Senators Conway-Walsh, McFadden and Higgins, every good wish as they travel to Westminster. I thank them for their wonderful work on Vótáil 100. It is great that tomorrow Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will travel to Westminster, a sign of a new relationship that recognises the importance of what was commenced with Vótáil 100. I hope the exhibition will also be a success. Senator O'Reilly also spoke about the events in the North and the parades. He also made a very pertinent point about home help hours, a point many Senators have made in the House in recent weeks. There seems to be a clogging up of the system in regard to home help hours. As Senator O'Reilly said, it has become a career structure and a very positive one in our health system. We all want people to live longer and stay longer in the privacy and comfort of their own homes. I would be happy for the Minister of State to come to the House to have that debate in the new term. Senator Boyhan spoke about healthcare and housing. I understand details of the proposed national regeneration and development agency will be announced tomorrow. Representatives of NAMA have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. The Senator made an interesting point about residential units being left idle, something we should all pursue as a matter of urgency. I join him in hoping that we will see a resolution of the impasse over the reopening of beds in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Senators Lombard and Gallagher spoke about the impact of the weather on the farming community because of the drought and now the impending fodder difficulties farmers will encounter in the autumn and winter.Senator Lombard is right when he speaks about the number of animals on our farms. He also makes an interesting point about the mental health of farmers, which has been affected by these events. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, is acutely aware of that issue. Senator Gallagher should note that the Minister has reconvened the subcommittee in the Department. I think it is important to recognise that there is a need for the Government to be vigilant on this issue. We will see a change in the weather in the autumn and I hope farmers will be looked after in that regard.  I will be happy to accept Senator Gavan's amendment to the Order of Business. The Senator raised an issue regarding University Hospital Limerick, which he has raised previously in the House. I am sure the Minister's investigation amounts to much more than a courtesy letter to the hospital. As Senator Gavan knows well, the role of unions is protected and enshrined in legislation. I would certainly be surprised and shocked if any hospital CEO tried to eliminate unions from a hospital group.

I do not believe it is taking place. I am not familiar with day-to-day matters at the hospital but, as I have stated previously, we need trade unions to be the voice and representative of workers, in this case in our hospitals. I stand four-square behind any worker's right to join and be part of a union and to have the union act as his or her active voice and representative. Senator Mulherin raised the habitats directive and its implications for development. I remind the Senator that the Government yesterday launched a rural regeneration and development fund, which will see €4 billion put in place. That is alongside €50 million in Leader funding and €240 million under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund operational programme. It is important to increase population growth outside Dublin.

A balance must be struck. Senator Higgins commented on sustainable development and certain other issues. We must strike a balance, but I think the point Senator Mulherin makes is that we must be open to the development of rural Ireland, and the Government is open to such development. Senator Humphreys raised the issue of local government boundaries and cited the example of Rathmines and the division of the urban village. There are parts of where I am from in Cork, for example, in Grange, where boundaries go through housing estates. A new local election boundary literally goes through a house in the area. This poses a question that I have repeatedly asked as to how these lines on maps are drawn. Do members of these independent boundary commissions not recognise that this must be about not dividing communities and allowing for a community voice to be heard?

I hope the house in question will be part of one electoral division. However, this case prove the point that those who sit on independent boundary commissions are not always right. We should not be afraid to hold them to account but we cannot do so. This issue, which Senator Humphreys was right to raise, is a bugbear of mine. I join Senator Humphreys in commending Dublin Port on its growth. I recognise that it was the Taoiseach who, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, implemented a new ports policy that set a new course for our ports. I am glad Senator Humphreys is joining me on that. Senator Lawlor raised the issue of Seanad reform. I would be a little premature to have a debate on Seanad reform because we are charting waters that have not been navigated. I am sure the chairman of the Seanad reform committee, Senator McDowell, will be happy to report in due course. I remind members of that committee that the Clerk of the Seanad, Mr. Martin Groves, set out most important information in his position paper to the Seanad reform committee.

I am glad he did not blame the Government for the price, because it does not set it. The price is beyond our control. It is a source of worry that crude oil prices have increased, and one of which we have to be cognisant. Senator Byrne rased the issue of farm safety week, which is an important week. I commend our colleague, Senator Martin Conway, on his work on farm safety in the previous Seanad and appeal to all those who work on or visit farms to take heed of the need to be safe. I pay tribute to and sympathise with the families of those who have died through farm accidents. Injury or death on a farm is a horrific experience and I would not wish it on anybody. I hope we can see a further reduction in fatalities, injuries and accidents. We need to continue to increase awareness and to have an action plan, as we did with road traffic. I commend the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, on the work he is doing on this issue. I welcome the employment created by WP Engine. I am reluctant to get involved in the forthcoming semi-final between Cork and Limerick, other than to wish both teams well. Obviously, I will wear the red and white of Cork.

All of us are cognisant of the fact that there are people who are suffering. The Scally inquiry has been established and it is important it gets to the truth. We can never allow this to happen again. It is not about obfuscation or passing the buck but about ensuring we get the full truth for all of the people involved. Senator Grace O'Sullivan referenced the issue of the Newgrange prospect. I welcome the new historical finds. I know Providence Resources has issued a request around frontier exploration licence, FEL, 6/14. That is a matter for the Minister. He will make that decision and I will be happy to convey to him the comments of some Senators. Senator Conway raised the issue of value added tax, VAT, and the threshold for the self-employed. That is part of the pre-budget submission of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, IPSE. I join the Senator in hoping the current VAT rate for the hospitality sector is retained. I know there is a debate on the cost of hotel rooms but I genuinely believe the introduction of the lower VAT rate has been of benefit to the whole hospitality industry. I go back to the argument I always make in the House, namely, that people should tell those who use the hairdresser every week or two weeks and the hairdresser who employs staff that we will increase the VAT rate.

We are near full employment, which involved a significant journey from where we were in 2011. I acknowledge Senator Gavan's point on hotel room prices. I have always said in this House hotel room prices have gone astronomically high, in particular, in the city of Dublin. However, one must bear in mind that the VAT rate applies not only to Dublin. It applies to all other parts of the country where there is not the same increase in hotel prices and where there is not the same occupancy rate. If one talks to hoteliers - I refer not to the big shots but the ordinary man or woman who is struggling - they will tell one not to touch it.

First, the Leader has no role to play in the setting of amendments. The business of the House is agreed by the House. Second, the time limit is determined by the Bills Office.

We should come in here as legislators and be able to legislate for the common good rather than looking at the currency that is called "votes". It is important to recognise that. Senator Mullen can talk to the Cathaoirleach and to the Clerk of the Seanad regarding the amendments. That is beyond my grace. If the Senator checks his email, there was an email sent regarding deadlines and timetables. Finally, I agree with Senator Ó Ríordáin in the context of the events of the past week, in terms of Europe and in terms of the ability of us to work together. The events in Helsinki yesterday beggar belief. Where the President of America would be so subservient to President Putin, it frightens me.

Finally, more fhocal scoir, I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the Cathaoirleach for your courtesy and professionalism. I thank Bridget and Martin and all the staff in the Seanad. I pay tribute to the ushers who come in here every day to look after us, the catering staff, the cleaning staff, the staff in the Bills Office for their patience, courtesy and good humour, and in particular, the men and women who record us here - the sound people - and the stenographers who take down, and sometimes make up, prose much better than it is. They do tremendous work. They work anti-social hours. I also pay tribute to the two men who look after us in the voting. They are tremendous people. The Houses of the Oireachtas is the sum of the parts of all of us. In my case, I thank Orla in my office for her courtesy. Indeed, I thank the Government Chief Whip and the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip for their co-operation, but also the leaders of other parties for their good humour, flexibility, co-operation and graciousness. They come with particular viewpoints but we iron them out sometimes. We might have difficulty sometimes but, in fairness, we all come with the common objective to pursue the work of this House of the Oireachtas on behalf of the people. We are on the edge of a summer break. I thank also the staff of all Members of the House and the secretaries of all the Members of the House for their co-operation. We have had a very busy time, despite what some in the media will say. It has been a productive term, not least the fact that we have had nearly 26 hours' debate on the Judicial Appointments Committee Bill 2017. In saying that, today is an lá deireanach. I wish everybody in the House, both staff and Members, a happy laethanta saoire an tsamhraidh. I hope the Members have a refreshing and a good time and come back in the autumn for an equally busy time. Stay safe, enjoy the summer and bain taitneamh as.

Its purpose is to bring within the remit of the 2000 Act any parent or parents who choose to enroll their child in a recognised school before the child reaches the compulsory school-going age of six. This means that the education welfare service of Tusla would be able to engage with all parents of children registered in a school rather than just those who have reached the school-going age. As indicated on Committee Stage, I wish to bring a number of amendments to this Bill. These amendments seek to correct a number of technical inaccuracies and also clarify matters so as to minimise any potential unintended consequences that may occur arising from enactment of this Bill.My officials have engaged with counterparts in the Department of Education and Skills and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in considering the same. I propose to group the amendments into two parts, the first comprehending the technical and drafting amendments, including amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 to 8, inclusive. These amendments seek to clarify and update the titles, the definition and references. They reflect the fact that the national educational welfare board is no longer in existence and that its functions, as from January 2014, have transferred to the Tusla education and welfare service under the remit of my Department.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	152	I refer to amendments Nos. 3 and 5. These amendments will address issues that may emerge in changing the definition of a "child" and the impact it may have on the operation of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. I propose an amendment to section 2 to ensure that only children registered in schools in receipt of primary education fall within the scope of the Act. I want to ensure that children in receipt of preschool provision who are attached to and registered in a recognised school are not brought within the scope of this legislation. I do not want a situation where the powers of the EWS are applicable to any child in the preschool setting. With regard to section 20 of the Education (Welfare) Act, the situation as it currently stands is that a parent cannot remove their child from the register of a school unless the child concerned is registered in another school or the parent intends to educate their child outside a recognised school as per section 14 of the Act. In practical terms, the change in definition may impact on the decision of a parent to remove their child from school for a valid reason, such as where a parent of a four year old child subsequently believes the child is not ready for school after a period of attendance at that school. School readiness is a key issue as regards young children making this transition and we need to allow for the fact that, in some instances, a child might not be school-ready. Therefore, I want to empower parents to make decisions they feel are in the best interests of their child. In such cases, where a four or five year old child is not ready for school I want to ensure the parent has the power to remove the child from the register of a recognised school if they believe it is in the best interests of the child to do so. Before such a decision is made, however, a parent will consult with the school principal to ask if he or she believes that is appropriate and this will ensure parents have sufficient information to make an informed choice in the best interests of the child. Neither the Bill itself nor any of the amendments I have proposed will interfere with the compulsory school age of six and all powers and obligations in the 2000 Act in respect of school attendance will continue to apply to children who reach this age. The amendments will ensure a supportive and proportionate approach is taken to the needs of four year old and five year old children who are registered in a recognised primary school. This is a critical time when children engage in one of the most important learning and development journeys of their lives.

I thank all Members for supporting it. I do not want to make value judgments or blame anyone but there may be a five year old in a school whose parents are not empowered to, or are going through circumstances where they cannot, attend to the child's educational needs. They may love their children deeply but circumstances can sometimes get in the way. With the passing of this Bill, however, the State and Tusla can encourage those parents and engage with the family to ensure the educational rights of a child under six are upheld. It is fundamentally important that every child gets the best start, and poor attendance patterns which start when a child is aged five can last a lifetime. We are not trying to impinge on families or hurt them but we have to uphold the education rights of children. Their attendance at school is important and we cannot wait until they are six to address these issues. I thank the Minister on a personal and political level. She understands, instinctively, the power of education and she has a vision of the five year old in her mind, as well as knowledge of what an education can do for them. That is what this Bill is trying to achieve. The State can now intervene in a compassionate and empowering fashion with the child and the parents to ensure the child can have his or her education rights upheld. I appreciate what the Minister and her officials have done and I accept that her amendments had to be made to achieve what we want. I look forward to it being passed into law by both Houses so that five year olds and younger children in our education system can be protected.

Some people will retire who would prefer not to and will be caught in limbo because the Bill has not been passed as quickly as they would have liked. I record, therefore, that Fianna Fáil reserves the right to examine the legislation again to give some comfort to those people to ensure that if they want to continue to work until they are 70, they are not forced to come back at the bottom of a scale where they have retired and received a lump sum.

As I said at the outset of Second Stage, it is important to note that people are awaiting the enactment of this legislation. As such, I hope it receives the same level of cross-party support in the Dáil as it has received here. I appreciate the concerns Senator Horkan and others have raised on interim arrangements for people who are waiting now to see the legislation enacted, including staff members in the Houses of the Oireachtas as well as other public servants. There had to be interim arrangements as we could not have had a situation whereby we cut people off at 65 knowing there would be a cohort coming after them with the option to work until 70.I appreciate the Senator's concerns, but our hands are tied to an extent. When a person takes a lump sum and engages in a pension scheme, there are consequences. It is unfortunate from our point of view, as we would have loved it if everyone could be in a different situation. However, the longer the legislative process takes, the more people will move into that situation. We hope that the legislation will conclude in the Dáil as quickly as possible and that it will go to Áras an Uachtaráin thereafter. This is good and progressive legislation, in that it allows people to continue working, contributing and using their experience. I thank Senators for their contributions and I look forward to the remainder of the debate in the Lower House.

At the outset, I express my appreciation for the willingness of both Houses to prioritise the speedy enactment of this Bill, which will provide the legal basis, among other matters, for the full compensation of Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance third party claimants. I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in its scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill. I thank its members for their detailed consideration of the proposals. Senators will note that many of the committee's recommendations have been taken into account in drafting the Bill. For example, provisions have been made for the recovery of costs by the agencies involved - the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, the Central Bank and the State Claims Agency - and a mechanism provides the flexibility to change the levy in response to the amount held in the fund and other relevant regulatory considerations.

The Bill stems from the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation Ireland report and seeks to implement the recommendations of that report, which was approved by the Government in July 2016. As Senators are aware, the review was triggered following the failure of Setanta Insurance, a Maltese incorporated company, in 2014 and the uncertainty that followed over compensation arrangements for third party claimants, which highlighted weaknesses within the current insurance compensation framework in Ireland. Following the placing of Setanta into liquidation, legal proceedings were commenced between the Law Society of Ireland and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, in order to establish who was liable for the payment of compensation to third party claimants. In September 2015, the High Court held in the Law Society's favour and found that MIBI was liable and the Court of Appeal upheld this decision in January 2016. This was the context of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation Ireland, which was carried out in 2016. The review made a number of recommendations which are addressed in the Bill. The key recommendations are that the level of compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, for third party motor claims be increased from 65% to 100% in line with that currently provided by MIBI; and that the increased coverage of the ICF be funded by a direct contribution to the ICF from the motor insurance industry via MIBI to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims. Subsequently in May 2017, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the High Court and the Court of Appeal and found that the Insurance Compensation Fund was liable for payment of compensation in Setanta third party claimants. The major effect of this was that Setanta third party claimants who had previously thought they were going to receive full compensation were now entitled to 65% of the claim, or €825,000, whichever was the lesser. As a consequence, the Minister for Finance after appropriate consideration agreed that Setanta third party claimants will receive 100% of a claim, subject to a limit of €1.22 million in the case of claims for property damage. This decision is reflected in the Bill. As noted above, a key recommendation of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland was the decision that industry pay an additional 35% compensation. The question of how this should be done was subject to much discussion. The insurance industry opposed the idea of paying the 35% contribution directly from MIBI as it believed it would create an open-ended exposure as it would not know what its obligations would be from year to year. In simple terms, it could be 35% of a very small amount or 35% of a very large amount, depending on the size of the insurer that went into liquidation. The industry believed that would create more uncertainty and unpredictability and would lead to higher capital charges. To resolve this issue, the industry proposed the establishment of an ex ante fund into which it would make a contribution equivalent to 2% of the gross written motor insurance premiums. Such a fund once built up would allow the industry to meet its obligations and would provide it with the necessary certainty as to the extent of its exposure.  Prior to the publication of the general scheme of the Bill, a number of policy options were examined in the regulatory impact analysis, including the joint committee's proposal of the State funding the additional upfront 35% cost. On the basis of this exercise, the preferred option was to accept the industry's proposal and establish an ex ante industry fund into which insurers contribute an amount equivalent to 2% of gross written motor insurance premia to be used to meet any future obligations in respect of motor insolvencies. The rationale for this approach over the other approaches was that it was felt that it best struck the balance between protecting third party claimants affected by an insolvency and minimising the exposure of the Exchequer, particularly in the event of an insolvency of a large insurer, while at the same time ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive place for insurers to conduct business through the provision of as much certainty as possible to insurers operating in the State. It is important to note that this 2% contribution is not a levy on policyholders' premia, which has been reported extensively today. However, as Senators are aware, the Minister for Finance is prohibited under Solvency II from interfering in the pricing of insurance products and therefore he will not be able to compel insurance companies through legislation to absorb this additional cost rather than passing it on to policyholders. What the Bill provides is a legal framework that will allow companies to choose to absorb this additional cost. Therefore, instead of legislating for a levy to be applied to insurance companies, the Bill provides for a contribution equivalent to 2% of the gross motor premia to be paid to an ex ante fund. With this approach, the decisions rest with the insurance companies as to how they finance this contribution, either through absorbing it themselves or passing it on to policyholders. If a more competitive insurance market can be generated, and this proposal is enacted, then some companies may choose not to pass it on to the policyholder. I will now outline the main elements of the Bill, which comprises 17 sections. Part 1 deals with preliminary matters including the Short Title of the Bill, definitions of terms used in the Bill and the authority for expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill. Separate commencement of Part 4 is included to allow the MIBI adequate time to put arrangements in place for the new motor insurers insolvency compensation fund. This Part also provides for the transfer of functions relating to the administration of the ICF from the office of the accountant to the High Court to the Central Bank and relevant functions in respect of applications to the High Court to the State Claims Agency where liquidations are already in progress. Part 2 deals with matters relating to the transfer of the administration of the fund, such as the preparation of final accounts of the Insurance Compensation Fund, the payment of any moneys in the ICF to the Central Bank and the transfer of records from the accountant to the High Court to the Central Bank and the State Claims Agency. Section 8 amends some of the existing definitions contained in the Insurance Act 1964 and inserts some new definitions. Section 9 amends section 2 of the 1964 Act to provide that the Central Bank of Ireland takes over the functions performed by the accountant to the High Court in relation to the administration and governance of the ICF. It provides that the accounts of the ICF be given to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than six months after the end of each financial year to be audited and thereafter laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Finance. Section 10 amends section 3 of the 1964 Act to disapply the current limit of 65%, or €825,000, whichever is the lesser, to be paid to third party claimants from the ICF in the case of the failure of a motor insurer. This amendment provides for the payment of personal injury claims in full and to a maximum of €1.22 million for injury to property in the case of third party motor insurance claims, in line with the amounts paid by the MIBI where a driver is unidentified or uninsured. It also provides that in such a scenario the ICF will be able to recoup the balance - over the limits mentioned - from a new motor insurers insolvency compensation fund to be established under section 16. These amendments implement the key recommendations of the review of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland. Finally, this Part facilitates the payment of 100% compensation to third party claimants for existing motor insurers that have gone into liquidation since 30 September 2011, namely, Setanta and Enterprise Limited. Section 11 amends section 3A of the Insurance Act 1964 to provide that applications to the High Court by a liquidator in the case of an insolvent insurer authorised in Ireland for approval of payment from the ICF must be accompanied by a report by the State Claims Agency following its assessment and verification of the claims. A provision is also included in this and the following section to ensure that any moneys recovered from the liquidation of a motor insurer be repaid on a pro rata basis to the ICF and the motor insurers insolvency compensation fund. Section 12 amends section 3B of the Insurance Act 1964 so that in the case of an insolvent insurer authorised in another member state, the State Claims Agency will make the application to the High Court. Before doing this, however, it will have assessed and validated claims on the basis of information provided by the person appointed to perform the functions of a liquidator in that other State. The amounts approved by the High Court will be paid by the Central Bank of Ireland from the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, to the State Claims Agency for disbursement to individual claimants. This section also shortens the time limit for making applications in the High Court for payments from the ICF for no more than once in any six month period to more than once in any three month period to allow payments to be made more frequently. Section 13, which amends section 3C of the Insurance Act of 1964, deals with companies in administration to provide that any application to the High Court for payment out of the ICF shall be accompanied by a report prepared by the State Claims Agency confirming that the methodology for estimating claims reserves and for assessing liabilities applied is appropriate and in line with generally accepted accounting principles or practice. Section 14 amends section 6 of the Insurance Act of 1964 to update the existing regulatory powers of the Central Bank of Ireland to take action in the event of an insurer failing to contribute to the ICF. Section 15 repeals section 14 of the Insurance Act of 1964 which provides for regulation-making powers for the Central Bank in relation to the Act. This is because the Central Bank already as appropriate regulation-making powers under section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. Section 16 provides a legal basis and sets out the arrangements for motor insurers operating in the Irish market to contribute an amount under normal circumstances, equivalent to 2% of gross written motor premiums, GWP, to an ex ante fund to be held by the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, to be known as the Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation, MIIC, fund. The contribution rate will be subject to an annual review by the Minister and may be varied between 0% and 3% depending on factors such as the amount held in the MIIC fund and the likelihood of a call on that fund in line with the following parameters: an amount equivalent to 2% of GWP until the MIIC fund reaches €150 million; reducing to a contribution equivalent to 1% until the MIIC fund reaches €200 million; and contributions to be then suspended until such time as there is a call on the fund. In the event of a significant call on the MIIC fund, and there being insufficient moneys in the fund, the contribution can be increased to the equivalent of 3% of GWP until the fund reaches €50 million, after which time a contribution equivalent to 2% of GWP would again apply. It also sets out the circumstances in which payments will be paid out of the MIIC fund to the ICF and in the event of an insurer failing to make a contribution to the MIIC fund, the MIBI may seek to recover the debt and refer the matter to the Central Bank for regulatory action if deemed appropriate. Section 17 amends the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide the statutory basis for the State Claims Agency to carry out the additional functions provided to it under this Bill. I would like to reiterate the importance of the swift passage of this amending Bill to ensure that the full compensation can be paid to Setanta and Enterprise third party claimants who have been waiting a long time for the resolution of this matter and I commend the Bill to the House.

We will be supporting the Bill and I am glad that it has finally got here. I accept that there are reasons, which the Minister of State outlined. I read the Dáil speech last week on this matter and know some of the reasons it has been delayed. It is nonetheless 2014 since Setanta went wallop, and more than two years since the publication of the Report of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland. There are still 1,577 open claims, of which 771 have not received one cent of compensation, and another 826 have received the 65%. In some cases, these are very significant amounts, and these people have had to put their lives on hold. We are more than happy to support this Bill and I am not going to delay its passage through this House. I hope the Minister of State will be able to outline when this Bill will be passed and enacted, so that we can proceed with the business of dealing with these people. I will not get into a debate about it but we have discussed motor insurance in committee, both when the Minister of State was on this committee and since he was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, and not too long ago we talked about a Garda fraud unit. I want to put on record, as I did this morning on the Order of Business, that I welcome the activity of Hertz in pursuing people who are making fraudulent claims and investigating them. I welcome the judge's decision to pursue those fraudsters for the €23,000 in costs that it cost Hertz to investigate their claims. That said, those people should be in jail. They should be convicted, charged and fined far in excess of the cost. We need to have a deterrent for fraudulent claims because we are all paying for it. We may need to ensure people who are legitimate make a claim and get paid. However, we need also to ensure people who are engaged in insurance tourism, whether they are based in or are visiting this country or whether they are Irish or a different nationality, are pursued for fraudulent activity. We are all paying heavily for it. It is only when these cases come up that we realise how bad it is. We know that 92% of people who pay do not claim in a given year. Of course people are entitled to claim. Anybody can have an accident and that is what insurance is for. We have seen cases in the hospitality industry, in pubs and nightclubs. Senator Mulherin organised a presentation in the AV Room couple of weeks ago with Allianz. We were shown clips of people throwing water on the floor of toilets, looking to see if there were cameras in order to avoid them and then making claims. It was only when they were confronted with the evidence that they walked away. However, there is still a cost involved and there is no deterrent in that they are still able to walk away. I will not go into all the issues around motor insurance, including the NCT and older cars. The insurance companies are saying people are buying old cheap cars and crashing them. Environmentally, and for lots of other reasons, it is not a good idea for every car that is more than ten years old to be put off the road when it could have low mileage and have passed its NCT. We are not a car manufacturing country so every car we buy is coming from another jurisdiction. It is money leaving this jurisdiction to go somewhere else. We need further work on motor insurance. I know the Minister of State is pursuing it as did his predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The Minister of State will say the CSO figures are down from the peak but they are up over 30% on 2012 and are up very significantly for many people. For everyone who seems to have had a drop, I know of many people who have had significant increases and have not seen a drop yet. We need the national claims information database. We need much effort on fraud and far more transparency and data from insurance companies. I have no doubt that we will be tackling insurance again with the Minister of State. The Minister of State said this is not a levy. While it may not be a levy, it is going to become one. I take the point the Minister of State made that he cannot stop insurance companies. However, if they are going to have to collect 2% of gross written premiums somewhere, they are going to pay it out of their profits or they are going to add it on to the price. Realistically, I think we all feel they will add it on to the price and put it into this fund to pay for the activities of Setanta and its bad practice when it was here and its insolvency. We are already paying a levy for Quinn and we will now pay another levy. I know the Minister of State will say it is not a levy but if insurance companies are going to have to collect 2% of gross written premiums to put into a fund, which will reduce, I admit, to over 1% when the fund reaches a certain amount, somebody is going to pay for it. The insurance companies are not going to pay for it out of their profits, particularly when they are telling us that they are not making money in the first place. We also have 3% stamp duty. A significant amount is being added to motor insurance. I read the transcript of the debate last week and every issue under motor insurance was covered, from rural roads to the NCT to various other things. In regard to the Minister, Deputy Ross, we will see road traffic legislation in this House later today. I think it is our last piece of business before we adjourn, but I do not intend to go into all of that. The Minister of State is aware that the committee, of which I am Vice Chairman, has done a lot of work motor insurance as has the cost of insurance working group. However, fraud, excessive claims and deliberately fraudulent claims need to be tackled head-on and people need to know that there will be severe consequences. If one is caught robbing a bank, one will most likely go to jail.If one is caught making a fraudulent insurance claim, one does not. One just walks away and says, "Oh well, better luck next time. I will try again." We all hear of stories in the newspaper where somebody happens to be very unlucky and has had 14, 15, 16 or 20 claims. We need to expose this. We need to ensure, in the long term, genuine people who are entitled to insurance payouts get them, and that everyone else does not because, ultimately, we all pay for it. The Minister of State acknowledged that high payouts mean high premiums. There should not be high payouts in many cases. That would and should reduce out premiums. I commend this Bill to the House. I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and I wish the Bill a speedy passage through this House today. Will the Minister of State revert on when it will be enacted?
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	170	I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome this Bill on behalf of Sinn Féin. It should have been before the Houses sooner. We want this Bill passed as quickly as possible. As the Minister of State acknowledged, this issue is time sensitive as there are people desperately awaiting payments to which they are entitled, and the fact that this issue remains live means insurance premiums continue to increase. The recent conviction of David Drumm shows where the majority of deception, criminality and blame for premium hikes lies. He was convicted for offering illegal loans worth €450 million to ten wealthy businessmen. Those loans, known as the "Maple Ten", originated from the fact that Seán Quinn of Quinn Insurance was betting on Anglo Irish Bank and built up a contract for difference of 28%. As he admitted, he was chasing his losses so he took €280 million out of Quinn Insurance to try to cover them. Today, everybody who has a non-life insurance policy is picking up his tab and the tab of the bankers who facilitated such schemes, while those responsible walk away free. For the past number of years we have picked up the tab, the cost of which was €1.5 billion. Irish consumers will pick up that tab for many years to come and that puts the issue in context. We cannot continually revisit the fact that insurance companies are collapsing in this State because of dodgy regulation, criminal practices or alerts that should have been identified but were not acted on.  Every one of us has experience of our insurance costs continually rising, and receives representations from people and businesses which are crippled by ever-rising premiums. A recent report by the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the costs of doing business highlighted insurance costs as a major impediment to SMEs. It does not only affect businesses in terms of the cost of public liability and vehicle insurance, but it also affects workers who are quoted massive car insurance premiums, which puts pressure on their take-home pay. My colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty called for such legislation three years ago. It must be seen as an admission by Government that the continual rise of insurance premiums is not because of a massive spike in fraudulent claims.  The high-profile collapse of Setanta Insurance left many people high and dry. Not only did customers continue to take out policies from Setanta until January 2014, but many were waiting on payouts from accidents that were not their fault. Several claimants have received up to 65% of their payment but nearly half of affected claimants have received nothing. It is sometimes hard for us in the Leinster House bubble to understand the impact of delayed payments on the lives of people. If one good thing can come from this Bill, it will be that the insurance companies can no longer point to the likes of the Setanta debacle as the go-to excuse for ever-rising premiums. The excuse is now removed, and in passing this Bill the ball is now in their court. I am uncomfortable with the planned funding of a unit of An Garda Síochána by the insurance industry. The proposal that the industry should fund a new Garda insurance fraud unit is not the way to go about this. There is a clear need for such a unit. However, it is the role of An Garda Síochána to form such a unit, which should be funded by the State. The insurance industry is under investigation by the competition authorities in the State and at EU level over anti-competitive practices. It is almost 12 months since dawn raids were carried out on certain insurers and Insurance Ireland as part of an investigation into anti-competitive practices. It is not appropriate for private business to fund bespoke sections of An Garda Síochána. The independence of An Garda Síochána is sacrosanct, and a direct funding relationship with private interests undermines that independence.  Insurance fraud is theft and must be pursued rigorously and prosecuted. More action needs to be taken to stamp out insurance fraud, including through setting up a Garda insurance fraud unit and introducing a new crime of insurance fraud. Only yesterday a ten-year sentence was handed down to a man who had set fire to his own business premises and then filed an insurance claim for hundreds of thousands of euro. While FBD welcomed the outcome as a turning point in attitudes towards insurance fraud, this case and others like it cannot account for the 70% increase in premiums over a three-year period. Recently, a judge also dismissed a claim by an Oireachtas Member. It is equally important, however, to challenge the insurance industry to stop settling suspicious claims, and to ensure claims found to be suspicious or fraudulent are reported and acted upon. I welcome the transfer of administration of the fund from the office of the accountant of the Courts of Justice to the Central Bank, where the Insurance Compensation fund will now rest. This brings an accountability structure as funds that are under the courts are excluded from the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is only right that such an important fund would come under the scrutiny of the State's financial watchdog. This is a massive fund. We now know the cost for Quinn Insurance is €1.5 billion and for Setanta Insurance is in excess of €100 million. However, if more responsibility is to be placed with the Central Bank, it must also be given the additional staff and resources that are required. The Central Bank often prefers stability to all other outcomes. It must have the back of the customer when it takes on this new role. We welcome this Bill and will do everything in our power to hasten its speedy passage.

I remember the PMPA debacle. 
In more recent times, there was the Quinn debacle. 
On those occasions the insurance policyholders ended up paying for the sins and mistakes of the insurance companies. Setanta Insurance was regulated outside the State through prudential regulation in Malta, while operating and selling policies in the State under the common passporting rules of the EU. The Minister of State made reference to the public discord on the 2% levy, and how we can ensure it is not passed on to the policyholders. The legislation has been amended and now tells insurance companies they are not required to pass it on, and they can absorb it into their costs. In policy disclosures, will they be required to make reference to the 2%? Can they show on the policy that they have absorbed it into the cost?  The Minister of State mentioned competition. It is incumbent on the insurance companies to make fully aware to policyholders whether they are passing it on by way of an insurance premium, or whether they are absorbing the cost. I ask insurance companies to absorb it. Based on reports, insurance companies are beginning to make profits again. It is something I feel strongly about. On the positive side, I welcome the fact that the Insurance Compensation Fund will be under the control of the Central Bank. I also note the accounts will be looked at by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is welcome. It will result in an annual probe in the public domain through the Committee of Public Accounts, which is also welcome. When does the Minister of State expect the Setanta policyholders who are awaiting outstanding claims to be paid? When does he anticipate the payments will conclude? He referred to the 2% levy and how it will build up to €200 million over a number of years. He mentioned approximately seven years, while others have said three or four years. Will he clarify that? If a company refuses to pay in, as he referenced, what are the draconian measures that can be brought to bear on them to ensure the charge is not passed onto policyholders?If we have a situation, a debacle, where an insurance company comes under pressure, claims are not being honoured and the fund has not got to €200 million, if it happens over the next year or two, who will underwrite that? Where will that fall? Who is responsible for the payout to policyholders? There is a period of time where we are looking to get to a critical mass of €200 million. What measures are there to ensure that something does not happen prior to getting to that level? This is the accountant coming out in me in respect of prudence. Is the €200 million figure actuarially based? What is the background to that figure? When we reach a critical mass of €200 million, will that be sufficient to deal with the requirements? How will we ensure that there is adequate funding there at any one time? We operate in an open market, a single market and an insurance market where we want competition.  The irony of this, in one sense, is that we had competition through Setanta. The level of regulation of Setanta - which was not conducted in Ireland - was clearly insufficient. I was a Setanta policyholder, not in more recent times but in the past. It was very competitive going through a broker and many people would have switched to Setanta unaware of how it was regulated. We have had the Central Bank before us in recent times. What additional measures could be introduced over time now that we have the Insurance Compensation Fund being built up and this additional 2% levy fund being built up? What can we do in respect of regulation to ensure that the fund becomes - for want of a term - a rainy day fund and not a fund used daily? Regulation is key. I refer to the regulation of any company, from the inside or the outside, coming in and operating in the Irish insurance market and ensuring it is properly regulated and prudential in respect of its financial structure.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	172	I welcome the Minister of State. We are here today to deal with an essential item of legislation to mop up a problem arising out of the collapse of Setanta and all the third party claims. Some people are significantly out of pocket because where they could and ought to have been able to rely on an insurance policy, it was not there. There is a big fallout and ripple effect in society. We are also told this is affecting the motor insurance premiums people are paying and that it needs to be sorted out. It clearly does. One disturbing thing is that, once again, we are going to policyholders. Notwithstanding all the calls that the insurance companies might absorb it, I do not think any of us is a fool when it comes to insurance companies. I have no great confidence that insurance companies will be absorbing anything. It will go back on the hard pressed motor policyholders - and they are hard pressed. Is this going to happen again? How are we going to safeguard against that with a company registered and regulated outside this country? How will it be checked and made to operate in such a way that we do not find ourselves in this situation going forward and having to go back to the policyholders again?  I also have concerns about the protection of the likes of Setanta and other companies behind the corporate veil. They can get away with what they like. Senator Kieran O'Donnell said that at one stage he was with Setanta and it was very competitive. We know, however, that the big contractors and builders who were very competitive in this country were cutting costs. I would call it externalising the costs. At the end of the day somebody pays and it is not these companies. The personal assets of the people operating these companies are intact and their homes are intact. The people paying are the policyholders or, in the case of the big contractors, it is the subcontractors or "subbies" that are paying. I know there is a market and in many ways we let it run loose and to dictate prices. If at the end of the day, however, people are hiding behind the corporate veil and externalising the cost because someone else will pick it up if it all goes belly up, that is not a public good, it is not in the public interest and we have to intervene to correct the market that is allowing this sort of behaviour to continue. I am concerned. We have had the report of the cost of insurance working group. I know the Minister of State put much work into it and this is a complex issue. We had a presentation last week, also attended by Senator Horkan, concerning the average person on the ground, particularly those with older vehicles. We were given shocking statistics. Vehicles aged ten years and older could not be insured. These are roadworthy vehicles with a national car test, NCT, certificate. Either an insurance quote was being declined by motor insurance companies or else they were being quoted such exorbitant prices that the vehicle had to be sold on. The figures we were given showed that vehicles were prematurely scrapped.  Why should the insurance industry be dictating that perfectly roadworthy vehicles should not be on the road anymore? That is what is happening. It is a major environmental issue as far as I am concerned. Worst of all, it is hitting people in the lower socioeconomic brackets and younger people. Somebody emailed me because I raised this the week before and I spoke to the Minister about it. I received many emails, and other forms of contact, from people buying a car for €2,000 and the third party insurance was €4,000. I do not know the circumstances of those people but there is enough of a pattern there to be concerned. We are about to levy a 2% charge on all of these policyholders. I am talking about all the people not feeling the benefit of the cost of insurance working group and its recommendations.  We can add to that the problem of public liability insurance. We see public houses, shops, etc., not finding insurance a safety net or something they can fall back on but as something that is crucifying them and putting them out of business. Even if a claim is not successful, it is loaded for several years probably before it is concluded and that is never refunded. In my own county, a business has gone to the wall. It was a very fine business and on the face of it there was no problem. It was a public house that served food. It was very busy and very popular but could not cope with the public liability insurance. I suppose it had to be asked what were those people working for. It is the same in Galway.  We have to do something because these insurance companies are protected by us. Their shareholders are protected by us. They are not paying the price. It is the ordinary citizens who are paying. It is us as politicians who are concerned about these people and we have to go around cleaning up after it. I await the Minister of State's comments on regulation and this sort of scenario not repeating itself.

If we can do that, it will then be possible to send the Bill to the President to sign it into law in the next couple of days. We can then begin the final stage of bringing the Setanta insolvency to a close by setting in motion the necessary progress to ensure full payment of third party claims. To date, there have been three applications to the High Court for payment of compensation from the ICF with regard to Setanta Insurance. Orders were granted in the High Court on 11 May 2018, 24 July 2017 and 15 November 2016. The total amount paid out of the ICF on foot of these orders was €14.6 million, being 65% of the total value of those claims settled. The most recent update from the Setanta liquidator has indicated that at the last payment of 11 May 2018, there were 1,577 active claims of which 826 claimants have been paid compensation subject to 65%, or the €825,000 limit. It should be noted that there may be more than one claimant associated with each claim. It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in applications to the High Court for payment from the ICF. The actual settlement of claims, however, is a matter for the individual claimants and the liquidator or for the courts and is something over which the Government has no control. I understand this process is in many cases still ongoing and is subject in some cases to complex negotiations between the relevant parties. It is hoped that in ensuring that third party claimants are compensated in full, the enactment of this Bill will encourage the speedier settlement of the outstanding claims. Once they have been settled, they will be included in an application to the High Court at the first opportunity.  It should also be noted that the preparation of this application will take a certain amount of time due to the need to verify and process claims but every effort will be made to ensure that this application and the ensuing payments can be made without delay. No date has been fixed for the next payment from the ICF but the liquidator has informed me that a further 117 claims have been settled since the last tranche was submitted to the State Claims Agency for verification. These claims will be included in the next application to the High Court and are to the value of €5.1 million, being 100% of the total value of the settled claims. Under a new regime, the State Claims Agency will make an application to the High Court in accordance with the amended legislation no more than once in every three-month period. This is a reduction from the current six-month period. Therefore, from a practical perspective, it is hoped that within three months of the Bill being signed into law, any third party claim that has been settled where 65% has already been paid will receive the balancing 35%. Any third party claims recently settled will receive their full settlement.

It is, therefore, important that any application is made at the optimum time in order to ensure that as many claimants as possible receive the compensation due to them with regard to the first application post-enactment of the Bill. There has been a lot of coverage in the newspapers today about the new industry contribution. First, it should be noted that this is not being introduced to cover the costs of Setanta and Enterprise. Instead, it is being put in place to cater for the additional 35% costs which may arise from any motor insurer insolvency. It has been described as a third party levy on policyholders. This is incorrect as the Bill provides for a contribution equivalent to 2% of gross motor premium to be paid by motor insurers to an ex ante fund. The decision rests with the insurance companies as to how they finance this contribution. The Minister for Finance is prohibited under Solvency II from interfering in the pricing of insurance products and, therefore, is unable to compel insurance companies to absorb this additional cost rather than pass it on to policyholders.  The option for the State to advance the necessary funds to the ICF to cover the full 100% compensation for third party motor insurance claimants and to recover the money through the existing 2% levy over time was one of the options considered in a regulatory impact analysis carried out in preparing the general scheme of the Bill. It was rejected in favour of the current proposal given the longer-term cost to the Exchequer as money advanced to the ICF for an extra 35% could not be recouped quickly compared to the scenario where there is a Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, fund from which the ICF can recover this additional payment within a short period of time. In addition, it would be inequitable to levy all non-life policyholders to pay for increased compensation for motor insurance for third party claims. It would also let insurers off the hook at the expense of the Exchequer. While it is accepted that insurers may pass the additional 2% on to policyholders, this will not necessarily be the case for all companies as absorbing it may provide certain companies with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Therefore, the legislation is designed in such a way as to allow companies to absorb this 2% contribution if they wish.  In adopting this approach, the Minister for Finance is seeking to strike a balance between protecting third party claimants affected by an insolvency, minimising the exposure of the Exchequer, particularly in the event of an insolvency of a large insurer, and at the same time, ensuring that the industry shares the burden of the increased coverage of the ICF, creating predictability and certainty for the insurance industry as to what its exposure for financial insolvencies will be and maintaining the attractiveness of Ireland for new entrants. In summary on this point, it can be argued that the real beneficiary of the ICF funding - 100% third party claimants - are the motor insurers and that over the medium term, it is at the expense of the taxpayer. Because of this, the Minister for Finance and the Government believe that the proposal to establish an industry fund for insurers to finance the 35% shortfall is the best way forward.  I will touch upon a number of the issues raised. Insurers generally make it clear where they are passing on State-type charges such as 3% stamp duty or the ICF 2% levy, so passing it on will almost certainly outline it in the renewed notice. Again, I want to put on the record of the House that on the basis that there will be no call on the fund prior to the building up of the target of €200 million, it is anticipated that the insurers will be required to make a contribution for seven years. A 2% contribution is expected to collect between €34 million and €50 million. It will be paid into it over four years to bring it up to €150 million. At this point, the contribution will be reduced to 1% and is then expected to collect approximately €17 million to €20 million for the next three years. At that stage, if the amount is €200 million, the opportunity is there to reduce it to between 0% and 3%.  What would happen if there were insufficient moneys to meet the figure of 35%? The first point to note is that it will have had no impact on third party claimants who will receive their payment in full from the ICF. What it means is that there will be a delay in the ICF recovering the 35% from the MIBI fund. In such a situation, it is proposed that the industry contribution of the outstanding fund would increase to an amount equivalent to 3% of the gross written premium until the ICF was repaid and the fund reached an agreed level of €50 million before reverting back to 2%. This approach is designed to provide industry with certainty as to what its contribution will be for any future motor insurance insolvencies. By increasing the contribution, it will ensure that the State is paid back as quickly as possible.  That is the general aspect of the Bill. I hope we can move this on to the next Stages and conclude it so we can get it to the President.

On the section, I want to make one point. It was brought to my attention recently that a young man was charged €5,000 for car insurance because his car clipped another car and the guy came back within a year claiming that he had back injuries and was awarded compensation. The point made to me was that if the average cost of insurance in the country is €750, which is regarded as average, there should be a cap on the percentage of levy charged. A young man paying €5,000 for insurance should not be paying a levy of €350. It is not proportionate or fair. I am not suggesting an amendment to the Bill but ask that the Minister of State would bear that in mind when it comes to dealing with the regulations and talking to the insurance industry. Someone paying a very high insurance premium must pay a much higher levy than, say, I would pay with a premium of almost €1,000, which would be €70. Young men and women are under awful pressure in terms of insurance costs and, in fairness, we should spread that burden. I ask the Minister of State to look at that with a very-----

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	191	I am very pleased to present this Bill to the Seanad. I am grateful to my colleagues in Dáil Éireann for expediting the progress of this short, technical Bill. I am conscious that while it is a short, technical Bill it is long awaited and much needed legislation to allow families in our country today be recognised as just that in terms of declaration of parentage. I am conscious also that while it is a short, technical Bill it is one that I hope will have a positive impact on many families and children across this country. After the constructive dialogue I engaged in last week I hope that the Seanad will continue in the same vein as far as this Bill and the related provisions of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 are concerned. As I indicated during the Dáil debate last week, legislatively, this is a straightforward but important Bill. Its purpose is to correct a typographical and technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act. This legislation is long overdue and urgently needed in order to clarify the legal status of children born in this country as a result of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, procedures. As was highlighted during the Dáil debate, children are no longer raised solely in what was the traditional mother-father nuclear family but in a diversity of forms that may include biological, social or adoptive parents, or those raised by their guardians. Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health, were enacted to recognise this new biological reality of donor assisted human reproduction where children may be born to people using donor gametes and embryos. These children require legal certainty in respect of their parentage and guardianship. It is imperative that we, as legislators, put in place a legislative framework that can provide that certainty and vindicate the rights of donor conceived children. The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted to reform family law in a way that is inclusive of, and sensitive to, the reality of contemporary family life in our country and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types. As such, Parts 2 and 3 represent key elements of that Act and their commencement is required to clarify the legal position of all parties involved in a donor assisted human reproduction procedure, but particularly the children born from such procedures. The provisions encompassing DAHR procedures relate to cases where the intending mother carries the pregnancy and gives birth to the child. As a result, these provisions apply to heterosexual couples, female same-sex couples and a single woman undergoing a DAHR procedure. The passage of this short stand alone Bill will enable me to proceed with the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which will have a very positive impact on the rights of families that have sought donor assistance to conceive. It is my intention, once this Bill has been enacted, to commence Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act in the autumn. The commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act will help to clarify the legal parentage of donor conceived children. It will also help to vindicate the rights of such children to information on their genetic heritage through the establishment of a national donor conceived person register and the prohibition of anonymous gamete and embryo donation. The introduction of this register acknowledges that many donor conceived children will have an inherent interest in their genetic origins and provides an important and safe mechanism through which they can access the information relating to the relevant donor, such as his or her name, date of birth and contact details, should they wish to do so. However, the aspect of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 that has been the subject of most intense interest but also, it is fair to say, some degree of confusion in media discourse and at a political and parliamentary level in recent weeks, is the provisions relating to retrospective declarations of parentage. These provisions enable parents of donor conceived children, who have been born prior to the commencement of Part 2 of the original Act, to seek a declaration of parentage through the courts. These retrospective provisions in particular are eagerly anticipated by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, community. Both my officials and I have met stakeholders in the LGBT community to address their concerns regarding the commencement of this legislation and the legal and practical benefits it will provide to that community. However, I emphasise that Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act are limited in scope and do not regulate all aspects of assisted human reproduction. Much of the focus of the Dáil debate related to matters that are outside the remit of the Children and Family Relationships Act. What we are doing today is trying to fix a technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act, ensure that it can be fully commenced in terms of Parts 2 and 3 in the autumn and then move on to the substantive and important debate on legislation we need to pass in respect of assisted human reproduction. Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 specifically relate to DAHR procedures where the intending mother is also the birth mother.As such, they do not encompass surrogacy. Provisions relating to the regulation of surrogacy in Ireland are included in the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017. The latter Bill, which officials in my Department are currently drafting in conjunction with the Attorney General, will provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction, of which DAHR procedures and surrogacy are just a small part. While acknowledging the concerns raised during the Dáil debate relating to matters pertaining to assisted human reproduction more broadly, the discussion here today and the deliberations ultimately in the Dáil were on the narrowly focused Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill. This is not the appropriate forum to reopen the debate; rather, we should pass this stand-alone Bill, conclude this matter and then move on to the very important assisted human reproduction Bill. In recognition of the important conversations and debates that need to occur regarding the development of a legislative framework for assisted human reproduction in Ireland, I have committed to convening a round table of all the relevant Ministers and Departments in September to work through these matters. I have also committed to providing a detailed update to the Oireachtas within the coming months on progress in respect of the development of the assisted human reproduction Bill and its introduction in the Houses, and to meeting with Opposition spokespeople on health regarding the matter. It is important to emphasise again that this amending Bill does not change any of the substantive provisions or policy intention of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act. We are fixing typographical errors to give effect to the provisions and policy intention already debated and passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I will now go through the Bill to outline the content of each section. Section 1 provides that the definition of the principal Act to be amended is the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. As I stated from the outset, the sole purpose of the Bill is to remedy a number of technical drafting issues with the original Act. This will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act. Section 2 amends section 4(a)(ii) of the principal Act relating to the definition of "donor" by the substitution of "section 26(5)" for "section 26(6)". Section 26(5) of the 2015 Act refers to gametes that are subject to a transition period of three years, during which those acquired on an anonymous basis prior to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act may be used in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure in the State, subject to certain conditions. In the 2015 Act, as enacted, section 4(a)(ii), relating to the definition of "donor", refers to section 26(6) rather than section 26(5). This amendment simply resolves that matter. Section 3 amends section 14 of the principal Act to provide for the Minister for Health to make regulations under that section. Section 4 amends section 16 of the principal Act to provide for the Minister for Health to make regulations under that section. Section 5 sets out the citation and commencement provisions for the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018. The advent of assisted human reproduction and subsequent advances with this technology have created a new reality, and Irish law must adapt to reflect these changes. Legislation relating to parentage, as outlined in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, brought much-needed clarity to this area. Further delays in commencing Parts 2 and 3 of the Act would have an impact on the rights of the most vulnerable individuals in donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, namely, children. This is why we are all so eager to resolve these issues through the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which the enactment of this amending Bill will facilitate. I commend the Bill to the Seanad. I hope we can move and pass the Bill today so we can resolve the technical issues the Bill seeks to address and facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act. I am sure we will all agree that these provisions are eagerly awaited and long overdue. From my discussions with many Members of this House and the other House, members of LGBT Ireland and other stakeholders and indeed other Ministers, I know there is much more work we need to do to put in place a comprehensive framework to regulate assisted human reproduction in Ireland. I know there are issues we need to address. They are the subject of that general scheme. That is available on my Department's website. I refer Senators to that. It has been the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny from the Oireachtas all-party health committee. I await its pre-legislative report. If we can pass this stand-alone Bill today so we can fix this anomaly, which has been painful for families and children in this country, and commence these sections in the autumn, I am absolutely committed to working on a cross-party basis and with stakeholders to try to make real progress on the assisted human reproduction Bill in the next session. I have already set out a timeline for engagement starting in September with stakeholders, other Ministers and Members of both Houses.

I make this contribution to the debate on the Bill on behalf of my colleague, Senator Swanick, who is unfortunately at another engagement. The Fianna Fáil Party will support the Bill. However, it is disappointing that technical and drafting errors in the original Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 have made it necessary. Nonetheless, we supported the original Bill, and it is essential that this legislation be passed quickly to give effect to the original intent of the 2015 Act. The Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 has as its purpose, as the Minister has outlined, the correction of typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. The correction of these errors will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act. As well as making regulations in respect of donor-assisted human reproduction procedures, Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor. This includes a requirement for gamete and embryo donations to be made on a non-anonymous basis and the establishment of a national donor-conceived persons register to enable children to access information on their donors, should they wish to do so, when they come of age. Donor-conceived children will also be able to seek and obtain information from the register relating to other children born as a result of other DAHR procedures involving the same donor. All those donating sperm, eggs or an embryo for use in a donor-assisted human reproduction procedure after the date of the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 must consent to the recording of their personal information on the national donor-conceived persons register. It is only in recent years that society has woken up to the trauma suffered by many adopted people through not knowing where they came from. Women incarcerated in institutions set up to keep them out of sight and mind were forced to give up their babies. Many of those babies grew up totally unaware of their history. Some who did try to find information were met with brick walls and incomplete files. We as a society and as legislators must learn from these mistakes. Access to information on genetic heritage is vital, and I am glad this requirement is contained within the Bill. Upon reaching the age of 18, a child can request from the Minister for Health the name, date of birth and contact details of the relevant donor stored on the national donor-conceived persons register. Upon passage of the Bill, the relevant sections, to which the Minister has alluded, of the 2015 Act are commenced and anonymous sperm and egg donation in fertility treatment will be prohibited under law. I thank the Minister once again for attending the House and assure him of the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.

I welcome the Bill and am happy to support it. I recognise that it will give considerable comfort and relief to many families who have been affected and eagerly await the commencement of these sections in Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill. This will be an important step forward in clarity for many. There are, however, as the Minister himself acknowledged, a number of areas which still need clarification, and there is a huge variety and complexity of situations in Ireland. For so long we have not acknowledged the reality of people who struggle to start families or the difficulties they face. Assisted human reproduction has not had regulation or clarity. People have struggled and found different solutions. I know there are concerns among many as to whether or not they or their concerns are addressed in the Bill. I recognise that the Bill does not attempt to address all that. I know the assisted human reproduction Act will, but there are some ambiguities, even specifically in the terms. For example, I received a letter from one family facing particular health complications. They went with a named donor because that is crucially important. It was a traceable donor in the UK. They have had one child and they are basically in the process of starting a new procedure in the UK.They do not know what might be the situation in terms of the embryo they have that is in the UK. Does it fall under the three-year window that is likely to be addressed in terms of embryo or gamete donations here or does it fall elsewhere because it is in the UK? This is why they see it as linking with the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018. I understand that many of these issues relate to assisted human reproduction but the family are concerned regarding their daughter and whether her future relationship with her potential genetic siblings would be recognised. These are examples of the complexities involved. The Minister might indicate that there will be an attempt, via the assisted human reproduction legislation, to link back to the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018. With the National Women's Council of the time, I was a passionate advocate of the proposed Bill. It was an extraordinarily positive step forward. It is good and healthy, as with our gender recognition legislation, that Ireland continues to update, improve and strengthen the legislation in these areas and to ensure that we remain to the fore in the context of best practice. Finally, I echo the eloquent points made by Senator Wilson on the question of the child's right to identity. I strongly welcome the clarity to the effect that people will have named donors and that they will also have the right to know their genetic identity and origins. I would urge the Minister to continue to engage with his Cabinet colleagues and address what needs to be addressed in the light of St. Patrick's Guild and all the rest, namely, the clear problems in terms of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016. We know how important this is and we have seen the court cases play out. Yet again, people are having to go to the courts to try to vindicate the importance of that identity. I hope that the spirit of the recognition of relationship which goes beyond the question of who is the primary care giver and beyond questions of guardianship - that wider right to relationship - is supported for those who have been through a poorly regulated and, in some cases, illegal adoption process in Ireland. I also hope that we will ensure their rights are fully vindicated. I am happy to support the Bill. I look forward to engaging the Minister on these issues further in the autumn.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	194	I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank them for their work on this Bill. As the Minister stated, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted to modernise family law in a way that is inclusive of and sensitive to the reality of contemporary family life in Ireland and to meet the needs of children living in diverse family types. Indeed, it probably brings us to a point where we may wish to have a referendum on the definition of the family in due course. It is certainly something that needs to be addressed, notwithstanding the amount of potential referendums we have in the offing at present. In addition to making regulations in respect of DAHR procedures, Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor. The Minister outlined much of that. The key provisions of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 are: removal of donor anonymity; establishing a national donor-conceived person register; restriction to altruistic donors; performing DAHR procedures; clarification of parentage of donor-conceived children; and retrospective declarations of parentage. The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 does not encompass surrogacy. Provisions relating to the regulation of surrogacy are included in the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017. The Government approved the drafting of a Bill on assisted human reproduction and this is a matter of priority for the Minister and his Department. It is certainly something that I, as a Member of the Oireachtas, believe we need to address in the short term. I would like to highlight a case pertaining to the 2015 Act that was brought to my attention. The case is that of a couple who had to attend a clinic in the UK for IVF because one of the ladies involved had significant fertility issues and the procedure they required is not currently provided in Ireland. Under the terms of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, they will be able to apply retrospectively for parentage for their daughter once the Act commences because retrospective recognition applies to children conceived in clinics abroad. The couple fear that it will not be possible to use a clinic abroad in the future, however, and are unsure of the status of the embryos that they have currently stored in the UK clinic. This couple used a traceable donor and have all documentation and consents regarding the donor. The partners both signed consent forms and agreed that one would be the legal parent of any future offspring. Senator Higgins referred to a similar case. Should that which I have outlined prove to be the case, it would mean that one partner would be recognised as the parent of their first child but not of any brothers or sisters. This may have been overlooked in the context of the Bill before the House. The point was also made that children born using anonymous donors are also being granted retrospective recognition and that there is a three-year window in the future for anonymous sperm to be used. However, there is no window in terms of clinics abroad, even though the embryos were conceived before commencement of the Act. This does not seem consistent with the intention of the legislation. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that point. However, I support the legislation.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	195	I commend the legislation before the House. It is progress that has been long called for and extremely hard fought for. I attended a public meeting on this issue over a month ago in the company of 50 parents and their children. The meeting was hosted by LGBT Ireland, representatives of which are in the Gallery. In listening to the loving, caring and dutiful parents who spoke, I was struck emotionally by the difficulties they encountered as a result of not being recognised by the State. There is no other issue I have raised more in this House than that regarding the recognition of same-sex parents and their families. While I do not have children, I cannot comprehend what it must be like for a loving family to feel vulnerable, particularly fearing emergency medical situations, custody scenarios or any of the array of other problems that a lack of recognition holds. I would not have highlighted these issues so much had the Department not consistently missed its own deadlines and, quite frankly, often been evasive on each occasion we sought to hold it to account. These delays do not affect anyone in these Houses who sought answers from the Department but they affected the families that we represent who relied on those commitments, who took solace in those commitments and who, time and again, were left disappointed over the past three years. For those reasons, I welcome and commend the Minister's comments on the need to hold a round-table of all relevant Ministers and Departments in September in order to work through various matters. The Minister stated that he has committed to providing a detailed update to the Dáil within the coming months on progress regarding the development of the assisted human reproduction Bill and its introduction. I respectfully ask that the Seanad be included in those updates, either through the Leader or through whatever channels the Minister sees fit. I will not dwell on this, but I hope the Minister takes cognisance of the fact that those of all parties and none want to see same-sex parents and their families fully recognised. I hope that will be considered as we progress the assisted human reproduction Bill and attempt to make it fully inclusive. I also commend the Minister on what he said in the Dáil last Wednesday and here today in respect of the general scheme of the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017. As previously stated, many LGBT families assumed that these legal rights were bestowed on them following civil marriage equality. There are many families who will conceive with the misunderstanding that they enjoy equal treatment before the law. There is a considerable task in navigating the rights of the child to the genetic identity and facilitating equal parental rights to those who have conceived through home insemination, surrogacy and IVF. In particular, I refer here to retrospective rights. I hope that the Department will prioritise this in its work programme for the autumn. I cannot stress enough the urgency behind the legislation and the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act.During my work with families over the past 12 months I heard of an incident in which a car carrying a legal parent and their child was involved in an accident. While the parent was incapacitated the non-biological parent could not give emergency medical consent. The longer these rights are delayed the more incidents like this there will be. It is every parent's worst nightmare. While this legislation will be passed today and will be enacted soon with Parts 2 and 3 being commenced, it is unfortunately not the end of the road for these families. Part 9, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, has yet to be commenced and equal parental status cannot begin until it is commenced. While I appreciate that work is under way to train civil legislation staff in these changes, Part 9 must be commenced urgently. Has the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection communicated with the Department of Health or the Government about when she expects to commence that crucial part of the Act?  In respect of the situation raised by Senators Higgins and Noone regarding embryos held by foreign clinics in case families wish to conceive again or for their child to have a genetic sibling, will those embryos be covered under proposed legislation?  I again commend the work of LGBT Ireland and Dr. Brian Tobin of the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG. Without their constant advocacy and guidance I and other Members probably would not have the awareness and insight that these issues require. I hope the Department engages with these activists and experts, including some of the 50 I mentioned from the public meeting who formed the LGBTQ Families and Allies group as part of the discussion on the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017. Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill today and commends and thanks those who have brought us to this point, including the Minister for Health.

In 2015 I welcomed the Children and Family Relationships Bill, since enacted. It is a very progressive reform of family law. We said at the time that it was long overdue and was child and family centred, with a contemporary pluralist view recognising the diverse forms of family life in Ireland. We were disappointed at the delay in commencing Parts 2 and 3 of the Act which, as the Minister said, were very significant parts of the original Act but have been held up for all of that time. Once they are commenced not only will children have the right to information on their genetic heritage through the establishment of a national donor-conceived persons register but crucially it will provide clarity and legal certainty on parentage and guardianship for children born through assisted human reproduction. I join Senator Warfield in welcoming the visitors in the Gallery. The specific case mentioned by others has also been raised with me. I have passed a query on to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone. Without going into the personal circumstances of the individual who contacted us, the question they asked was if embryos created in a clinic abroad before the Act commences lead to a successful birth after commencement of the Act, will parents be able to apply for parentage for that child. It is an issue of retrospection and the Minister addressed some of that in his speech but this is a very specific question concerning clinics abroad. I would be grateful for a response on that. I appreciate that this is a complex area and that the 2015 Act, despite being very significant and important in so many ways, does not deal with all the legal issues surrounding assisted human reproduction. I welcome the Minister's announcement that he hopes to see the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017 brought forward soon. There are many other issues that are not regulated, such as surrogacy. When I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights I was involved in the committee's hearings on assisted human reproduction in 2014. We published a report that year which fed into the Bill. The then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, was leading on what was to be a much more comprehensive Bill on assisted human reproduction and surrogacy. His successor, Deputy Fitzgerald, decided to have a more concise Bill that did not deal with surrogacy and all of assisted human reproduction which became the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. I appreciate that there are great complexities in legislating in this area. That is why the two were separated and why there was a delay in bringing forward the assisted human reproduction Bill 2017. Many families and children need the legal certainty that it will provide.  Some Members heard a very moving story on Joe Duffy's "Liveline" about illegal adoptions and the difficulties of tracing families in the past and the need for children to have access to information about their parents. This short technical Bill will facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 but when will they be implemented in practice? The Minister said he hopes to commence them in the autumn when the Bill is passed, as I hope it will be. When will the register be up and running? While the 2015 Act, this Bill and the forthcoming assisted human reproduction Bill 2017, provide important practical supports for people in diverse family forms, there is more work to be done to amend the Constitution to change Article 41. I see the Minister nodding in agreement. I am glad to see the Government announcing a referendum to delete the sexist and patriarchal language referring to women's place in the home but work needs to be done to ensure that Article 41 recognises more diverse family forms and not just the family based on marriage. I am glad we have amended the Constitution to broaden the definition of marriage but there is further amendment to be made to bring the Constitution into line with modern society and modern Ireland.

We note that it was guillotined in the Dáil on 11 July 2018. I pledge it my full support. Its purpose is to correct a typographical and technical error in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 which will facilitate the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of that Act. This amending Bill does not change any of the substantive provisions on the policy intentions of parts 2 and 3, which recognise donor-assisted human reproduction.That is a right that people have and ought to have. I welcome the register for information about parentage that was outlined, because it is critically important. I will not delay. This is not a day for long speeches. This Bill has my support but it is important that we clearly explain a child's right of identity. Parents and anyone involved in this process would want that to happen. I welcome the people who have taken the time to come to the Visitors Gallery. It is important legislation and many of those here have championed it for a long time and welcome it. I wish the Minister and his departmental officials well with this legislation.

I understand that it is a tidying-up exercise arising from issues which have been well debated in the Oireachtas with the Children and Family Relationships Act, which was legislation that I opposed and still oppose. That legislation at the time was partly an attempt to neutralise arguments that could have become central, and to some degree remain central, to the marriage referendum regarding the right of a child, as far as is possible, to be brought into the world and brought up by his or her biological parents or at least by a father and a mother. That is an aspect of the social good. The argument did not hold any water with the Government of the time. There was an ideological shift with this legislation. I remember the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, suggesting that the Government's approach was that there was no hierarchy of families. That is all well and good in one sense in that every child should be equally cherished by the State and no child should be in any way victimised or suffer from any lack of legal certainty in his or her own rights and the responsibilities of adults. That left open the problem, however, that we have largely embraced a laissez-faire attitude in this area, namely, that whatever the adult wants is where we start from. That is the reality of the recent abortion debate and the Government's stated intentions on abortion legislation, and it is also the Government's approach in issues such as assisted human reproduction and the legislation before us today. There is a significant subtraction from children's welfare and our responsibility as a society to children. We should be trying to find a way to recognise the diverse manifestations and diverse family arrangements, but always through the lens of how we secure the best for children. The child's best interest are supposed to be paramount, but time and again we see that they only come into it after adult's aspirations have been facilitated by politicians. The pain of childlessness is all too real. It is something that we need to address and approach with great compassion to facilitate people in the very natural desire to have children in their lives to love, cherish and care for. Past problems with adoption and how it operated should not prevent us from looking again in a mature way at the positives that can be in adoption, the generosity that can be there in putting a child up for adoption, where a parent cannot cope, and seeing adoption again as a social good. It is something that needs to be regulated and provided for in a way that looks out for the welfare of children. What of sperm, egg and embryo donation? Moral questions must be asked. When I say moral, I speak of right and wrong and of justice for children, not something that is necessarily located in a particular religious set of views. There are moral questions about the destruction of human embryos in how artificial human reproduction is often practised. That is not necessarily the case but it is increasingly the practice. We have heard from people such as Joanna Rose in the past who believe they may have hundreds of siblings because of the problem in how embryo and gamete donation has taken place. Far too little attention has been paid to people's suffering and to the need to recognise that people who donate gametes should almost always be required to take some responsibility for the maintenance and upbringing of the children who are their biological children. We never even have a discussion on these things. There is not time to get into the detail of these things but I will conclude with this. What worries me is not so much being in the minority on questions like this but the complete absence of debate about the morality of many of these modern techniques designed to secure and procure children for adults to bring up and the herd-like rush to a right-on, politically correct, slavish obedience to a new set of moral norms. The obedience that is now out there, the closing down of debate, is as bad as anything that existed in the repressive past that we often talk about in these Houses, even while we are talking about Magdalen laundries, the past abuses by adoption services and so on. I hope we can return to a situation where there is a serious interrogation of some of the core questions of human justice that are going on here. Are we really looking out for children's best interests if it is so widely possible and accepted to be bringing children into the world using the donation of gametes in circumstances that do not contemplate any role for the biological parents in those children's lives? If that is the point at which we only begin to discuss children's rights, we are falling far short of any sincere and mature approach to vindicating children's rights in our society.

I fully agree with Senators Noone and Bacik. I am straying slightly but there is definitely a need to do more in our constitutional understanding of the family. This is an area that needs careful consideration and work, but the idea that a mum or dad bringing up a son or daughter, or a grandmother bringing up three or four grandkids for years, effectively raising them, are not recognised as families because of our Constitution's outdated understanding of what constitutes a family is something that we should examine. Marriage is an important institution, and I am glad that marriage is a much broader and more inclusive institution, but it is not only through marriage that one can establish a family. There are many types of family today that I recognise as families, which unfortunately Bunreacht na hÉireann does not. That is something to which we should return in future. I thank people for their constructive engagement. It is interesting, when people speak of raising issues and not shutting down debate, but when I rise to respond to their points in the debate, they leave the Chamber. I suppose that is them shutting down the debate.

I turn to the substance of the issues. Several Senators raised a specific case and I will be pleased to respond in writing to provide guidance to that family in that situation and to any others. The legislation is quite clear in its understanding of a donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, procedure, and the definition scope is confined to procedures carried out in the State consistent with parentage being assigned under section 5 only where the procedure is carried out in the State and the child is born in the State. That is the legal reality. I want to make a point as we advance the assisted human reproduction Bill, the general scheme of which has been published by my Department, brought to Government and is being considered by the Oireachtas committee.The aim of any assisted human reproduction legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process such as donors and surrogates and most important, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. I fully reject any assertion that children now, and into the future, are not very much at the heart of what we all want to achieve as we move to regulate AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underlining the general scheme in our assisted human reproduction Bill. I share the view of colleagues on all sides of this House and I believe that there is a desire on all sides of this House and the other House to attach a priority to the AHR Bill. Considering that desire is there from the Seanad I want to assure Senators it is there from me as well. I will convene a round table of Ministers in September to tease through some of these issues and some of the issues that have been raised by LGBT Ireland who I welcome to the Gallery and I thank them for their constructive leadership and engagement on this stand-alone Bill and future engagement on the AHR Bill. I will take up Senator Warfield's request that we will keep the Seanad and the Dáil informed. In my verbal comments as opposed to my written script I referred to the Oireachtas but we will definitely do that. I acknowledge Senator Warfield's continued determination on this issue and for keeping the focus of these Houses on it over a sustained period of time. I appreciate the work that he did. Today is an important day. I hope it is a happy day. It is too long coming and people have waited far too long for this but I hope we are going to pass a piece of legislation in this House today, we passed it in the other House last week, that in the autumn will enable us to see declarations of parentage. This will not change what is happening behind a family door today where we already have functioning, loving families caring for their children but it will allow a legal certainty and a public legal declaration of that parentage being made in our country and we should not underestimate the significance of that. In terms of Senator Bacik's question on when the register will be up and running, it is our intention to establish that on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 in the autumn. On Senator Warfield's question regarding Part 9, I have spoken to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my officials are liaising with her on this. I will send her a transcript of the Senator's remarks and the other relevant parts on Part 9 from the Dáil debate. I will liaise with her on this throughout the summer months as well. I commend this Bill to the House and I hope we can now see its speedy passage.

I thank the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health for undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill last October and for their broad support of the new children’s hospital project. I hope that with the positive contribution and co-operation of Members of both Houses it will be possible to have it enacted without undue delay before the end of the year. The background to this Bill, pure and simple, is the well accepted need and long held ambition to significantly enhance paediatric services for children in Ireland. In 2006, the HSE published "Children's health first", which outlined that there was compelling evidence for one national specialist paediatric hospital based in Dublin that would also provide all the less complex hospital needs of children in the greater Dublin area. The report underlines the need for access to urgent care centres in Dublin in addition to the proposed hospital. In 2012, the Government decided that the new children's hospital should be located on the campus at St James’s Hospital and last year gave the green light to construction. The new hospital will be completed by the end of 2022. The outpatient and urgent care centres will open next year at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and in 2020 at Tallaght Hospital. The national paediatric hospital development board, which is charged with this capital project, should be commended for its work on this complex project. Building the new facilities is but one aspect of the new children’s hospital project. This project cannot succeed without providing the right structure for the staff who provide the care for our children. Paediatric services in Dublin are currently provided by three separate hospitals, namely: Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital Crumlin, Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght. All three have a proud tradition of caring for our children and families over many years. All three recognise the increasing demands on paediatric services and fully support the development of a single hospital as a world class national hospital playing a central role in serving an integrated clinical network for paediatrics in Ireland. However, providing services under the same roof but not under the same governance structure is clearly not feasibIe. Currently, the three children’s hospitals have their own boards and the integration and oversight of services of the three hospitals is managed by the children’s hospital group board, an administrative board. The staff and services of the existing hospitals need to come together under one single governance structure, hence this legislation. Under the Bill, the board of the children’s hospital group, will include representatives of the three hospitals’ boards and will become the first board of the new entity, thereby providing continuity in the important integration work. Establishing the legal entity as soon as possible will further assist the ongoing operational and cultural integration of these three hospitals in advance of the opening of the new hospital and centres. I commend the three hospitals' boards and the children’s hospital group board for their tremendous work and dedication to this project. In drafting this legislation, we were conscious of the need to achieve the integration of the three hospitals in a way which respects the values and cultures of each, while creating an entity with the effective governance and accountability required to ensure that the State’s investment in this project delivers the benefits required for children and young people. The approach has been to establish a distinct body with appropriate governance to take over the services currently provided by the three hospitals, and to have a leadership role nationally in the implementation of the national model of care for paediatrics and neurology. Like the existing children’s hospitals it will operate as a provider of services under section 38 of the Health Act 2004, that is, it will be funded by the Exchequer through the health Vote.The functions of children’s health Ireland will include planning, delivering and developing acute paediatric services as part of an integrated clinical network of paediatric care. The entity will run the new children’s main hospital and centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals when they are built. Before that, it will run the services on the existing sites at Tallaght, Temple Street and Crumlin. The new entity will need to work closely with paediatric service providers in other hospitals across the country, in the primary care system and in the community. Accordingly, it is given broadly-worded functions that provide clarity, authority and certainty in respect of its leadership role nationally relating to paediatric healthcare and the national model of care for paediatrics, as well as to deliver on its remit for education research, philanthropy and advocacy on behalf of children’s healthcare in this country. The new entity will be led by a 12-member competency-based board appointed by the Minister for Health, the first of which, as I said before, will be the board of the children’s hospital group. The Bill gives the board sufficient autonomy to make and implement the decisions required to effectively carry out its remit as a State body, subject to the high standards of corporate governance and accountability required of State bodies. The three hospitals coming together under this Bill have different legal forms and the provisions in the Bill relating to their transfers are, accordingly, slightly different. Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin and the Children’s University Hospital, Temple Street are established under the Companies Act; Temple Street as a subsidiary of the Mater Misericordiae and Children’s University Hospitals Limited. Tallaght Hospital is a body corporate under charter and ministerial order. As they are funded as section 38 bodies, the hospitals’ employees are classified as public servants, subject to standard salary scales for the health sector and with access, in the main, to a public service pension scheme. The Bill provides that employees will transfer on existing rights and entitlements. As stated above, the proposed new entity will also be a section 38 body. The Bill recognises the historical voluntary ethos of the three hospitals. For example, in line with their current practice, board members of the new entity will not receive fees. The Bill provides that the board of the new entity will nominate eight out of the 12 board members and the chairman of the board will be elected by the board. Members may recall that the Minister announced earlier this year that the new entity would not be called phoenix children’s health. The legal name, children’s health Ireland, reflects the object and functions of the new entity. However, it is considered that it may be useful for it to also have an operational name or brand name. The Department is engaging with the children’s hospital group on arrangements for a new process to agree an operational name, which would be endorsed by Government. While ensuring wider consultation, this new process will acknowledge the previous naming process and the valuable input of staff, patients, service users and the Youth Advisory Council. Members may have particular views on the operational name and I assure them there will be opportunities to contribute to the naming process. A two-step commencement approach is planned. It is proposed to establish children’s health Ireland and its board before the end of 2018 and, on 1 January 2019, to proceed to transfer the three hospitals to the new entity. The transfer is best made at beginning of the year for a variety of technical and financial reasons. However, the transfer will be subject to the completion of the necessary preparations and confirmation by the new board that it is satisfied it has the necessary structures and processes in place for a safe transfer day. I will now summarise the main provisions of the Bill, which consists of 67 sections contained in nine Parts. Part 1, preliminary and general, provides for the Short Title of the Bill, definitions and administration costs. Part 2, on establishment and functions of children’s health Ireland, provides for establishment day and sets out the object and functions of the new entity. These have been well described already. It will be able to form or acquire subsidiaries or other corporate vehicles for limited reasons and, only with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it may acquire and dispose of land, borrow and accept gifts. Part 3, on the board of children’s health Ireland, relates to the composition, role and modus operandi of the board. It will be a competency-based board. Of particular note is the method of appointing members of the board. The first board will be the board of the children’s hospital group. Half of the board, that is, six members, will serve for three years and half will serve for five years, thereby ensuring continuity on the board. When the term of office of the six members appointed for three years expires, they will be reappointed or replaced on the basis of two chosen by the Minister and four nominated by the outgoing board, similarly with those appointed for five years and so on every two years thereafter. While the Bill does not provide for nominations by professional bodies, this is not to say that members of those bodies may not be members of the board at any given time. However, employees of the new entity cannot be members of the board. Board and board committee members may be paid expenses but not fees. This is in line with the voluntary ethos of the three children’s hospitals. Part 4, on the chief executive officer, CEO, and employees of children’s health Ireland, provides that the CEO will be appointed by the board with the consent of the Minister, and can be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. The CEO of the Children’s hospital group immediately before establishment day will be the first CEO. The superannuation provisions provide continuity for staff of the three hospitals. Employees eligible for the single public service pension scheme will be members of that scheme and all other employees will remain or become members of the voluntary hospital superannuation scheme. Parts 5, 6, 7 and 8, relating to transfers of the three hospitals and the HSE to the new entity, are quite similar and I will summarise them together while drawing attention to some particular issues. These parts contain standard provisions for the transfer of employees, property, rights and liabilities, contracts, agreements and records of Crumlin and Temple Street, and such as may be agreed or designated for transfer from Tallaght Hospital and the HSE to children’s health Ireland. Of note is that land and buildings are transferring to the new body only from Crumlin hospital. Temple Street Children's University Hospital does not own the land and buildings it occupies in Temple Street. It is owned by a holding company, the Mater Misericordiae and the Children’s University Hospitals Limited, and of course there is no land to transfer from Tallaght Hospital, which will continue in existence as an adult hospital. No decision has been taken yet as to what will happen to the sites when the services move out in 2022. After the transfer to the new entity, the Crumlin and Temple Street companies will be wound up by their directors under the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. As directors will no longer have the indemnity they would have enjoyed had the company remained in existence, the Bill empowers the Minister to indemnify past directors of Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals post wind-up where a concerned director has discharged, in good faith, his or her duties in pursuance of the functions of the company. As for Tallaght Hospital, the Minister for Health will, in time, bring a motion before the House to approve an order to amend the Tallaght charter consequent on the transfer of Tallaght Hospital's paediatric services to the new entity. Finally, Part 9, on the national paediatric hospital development board, provides for a number of amendments to the order under which the national paediatric hospital development board was established and for the dissolution of the board in due course. The statutory instrument will be updated consequent on the establishment of children’s health Ireland. For example, it substitutes "Children’s Health Ireland" for the three children's hospitals in articles providing for consultation on the development of the new facilities and amends the appointment process to the board to better effect its role of equipping and furnishing the new facilities. Section 67 provides that the members of the board in office immediately before the section is commenced shall cease to hold office, thereby allowing for the appointment of a board under a new process. In addition, the Bill provides that the board may plan, equip and furnish the maternity hospital to be located on the St. James’s Hospital campus next to the new children’s hospital. However, this function will only be commenced if a future decision is taken that the board is the appropriate body to do so. In conclusion, as Senators can see, progressing this Bill is a vital step in the new children’s hospital project. I believe the provisions in the Bill will allow the robust governance structure necessary to oversee the transition to, and provision of, a single national specialist hospital for the children of Ireland.I look forward to hearing the views of Members on the Bill
#DiarmuidWilson	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-party	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-dob	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	208	I welcome the Minister of State. I am dealing with this Bill on behalf of my colleague, Senator Swanick. We will be supporting this Bill, which will place the new national children's hospital on a statutory footing. The Bill is long overdue, having been on the Government's list of legislation for three years. It is also disappointing that the new children's hospital will not be operational until 2020, or so we are told. When the St. James's site was chosen in 2012, it was expected that the hospital would have been built by now and would be operational. The Bill makes provision for the establishment of a single statutory entity, children's health Ireland, which will provide paediatric services and take over the services currently offered by the existing three Dublin children's hospitals, Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, Temple Street Children's University Hospital and the national children's hospital at Tallaght Hospital. In addition to providing secondary and tertiary paediatric healthcare services, the new entity will be the lead centre for paediatric education and training and research and innovation in Ireland. It will also be the centre of a clinical network for paediatric services. The new entity will initially oversee the complex work of integrating the staff and services of the three hospitals I have outlined, which it will run as a single service initially on the existing hospital sites and, in due course, in the new hospital and centres being developed. The primary purpose of the legislation is to establish a body corporate that will govern and manage the new children's hospital and provide services on behalf of the HSE as a section 38 body under the Health Act 2004. The Bill consists of nine parts, as outlined by the Minister of State, and covers establishment, functions and powers, board matters, employment - including the role of the CEO - accountability and standards. Functions will include the delivery of health services, research, education and related functions. The Bill provides for the creation of children's health Ireland, a legal name which describes the new entity whose future services remit is broader than only running a hospital. Under the Bill, this new entity will have responsibility also for providing secondary and tertiary paediatric healthcare services and will be the lead centre for the paediatric education and training and research in Ireland. We want this hospital to be up and running as soon as possible. I am sure the Minister of State and our colleagues in the Oireachtas want the same. We were told initially that it would be ready, open and operational in 2019, then it became 2020, and later 2021. Now we are informed that it will be 2022. I certainly hope that it will be open and operational by 2022. The main clients of the hospital will be our children. In that context, I wish to refer briefly to waiting lists. There have been some improvements regarding inpatient day-case lists since 2016 and this must be acknowledged. The overall total number waiting in the group of three hospitals is down from 4,637 to 4,224, which is a slight improvement but certainly not good enough. The numbers waiting more than 12 months for scheduled treatment rocketed from 640 to 1,117 between June 2016 and June 2017. It has fallen back again, thankfully, to 1,078, nonetheless this is far too high and it is far too long for young children to be waiting for much-needed treatment. Prior to the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, becoming Minister for Health in July 2014, there was a 20-week target in place under his predecessor, Senator Reilly, for children to receive scheduled treatment. However, when our current Taoiseach was appointed Minister for Health in 2014, he increased that to 18 months and, unfortunately, it has not been reduced in the interim. Last month, 449 children had been waiting more than 18 months for schedule treatment. For outpatients, the deterioration has been truly shocking. Overall, the numbers waiting has increased by 38.5%, from 32,290 to 44,714, in the past two years. That is totally unacceptable. For those who are waiting a long time, the wait has been proportionally longer unfortunately. The number of children waiting over a year has increased from 5,010 to 17,137 and the number waiting over 18 months has risen from 770 to 10,427, a thirteenfold increase since June 2016. That is the stark reality of what young people are facing. I welcome this legislation and what it contains. I implore the Minister of State to impress upon the Government the need to have the children's hospital up and running by the new target date of 2020. It is imperative that this happens.

I thank her for her very comprehensive overview the Bill and the project to which it relates. I am not going to say that I welcome every aspect of the Bill, particularly as we are on Second Stage. The Bill has been initiated in the Seanad and I thank the Minister of State for that. It is a welcome development. The Seanad has a particular role and function and I would like to see more Bills being initiated here. When the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, addressed the Seanad, he referred its important role in the context of scrutinising legislation. That is our primary function and our primary role is to enhance, scrutinise and to seek to amend and improve legislation. I thank the Minister of State for giving us the opportunity to do so first by initiating the Bill in this House. I genuinely acknowledge the latter and the role the Minister of State plays in that regard within the Department. I acknowledge that the Joint Committee on Health undertook legislative scrutiny in respect of this Bill and was broadly supportive of it and of the new national children's hospital project. That is important. There has been substantial pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill by Members on all sides. That is also important. The Bill, initiated in the Seanad and not yet debated in the Dáil, is to establish a body corporate, children's health Ireland, to provide paediatric services and consolidate the paediatric services currently provided by three hospitals. This is important legislation. As we go through the various Stages, it is crucial that we tease out various aspects with the Minister of State and her officials. I look forward to the debate because I am aware that a number of Senators intend to bring forward constructive and meaningful amendments, which, I hope, can be accepted. Clearly, the Minister of State must consider those amendments when they are tabled. I want to single out two or three issues to which the Minister of State referred. Part 4 provides that the CEO will be appointed by the board, with the consent of the Minister, and can be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. This is right and proper. It is worth emphasising that the Committee of Public Accounts will have the power, function and jurisdiction to bring in the CEO and cross-examine him or her in respect of any matters. That is really positive and it is one of the things that jumps out at me. I welcome that intervention because it is right and proper. Far too often we have not seen the sort of accountability that the public expects, not only in terms of the use of our finances for our health services but also in the context of general corporate governance, medical governance and everything else relating to the care of citizens, be they children or adults. Governance is important, as is accountability to these Houses, which approve requests for funding. This is going to be a state-of-the-art children's hospital and we want it to be par excellence in terms of the services it will deliver.This is very important. The Minister of State said "As for Tallaght Hospital, the Minister for Health will, in time, bring a motion before the House to approve an order to amend the Tallaght charter consequent on the transfer of Tallaght Hospital's paediatric services to the new entity." Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, could elaborate on "in time", as much as she can, given the current date and time and how far back we are from that. It is important to progress this Bill fast. I am glad that it was initiated in the Seanad. We have waited for too long for a state-of-the-art national children's hospital. I welcome the legislation. I give it a guarded and cautious welcome, and I look forward to hearing the various debates and amendments as it goes through the Stages for enacting legislation in this House. It is an important piece of legislation and I am glad we did not have a summer recess before we got it under way. I say "Well done" to the Minister of State.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	210	I am dealing with this Bill today on behalf of our health spokesperson, Senator Colm Burke, who has been unavoidably detained in Cork. Senator Burke played a significant role during the pre-legislative stage of the Bill when it was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health. On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I acknowledge the work Senator Burke has done on the Bill and the interest he has shown in it. I am always delighted to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to Seanad Éireann. She is deeply committed to her work and is a person for whom I have huge admiration. I salute her and encourage her in the important work she continues to do. I agree with Senator Boyhan that it is great the Bill was initiated in Seanad Éireann. We have a significant role to play in initiating legislation. I would like to see more legislation initiated in Seanad Éireann. The Seanad is a most important vehicle available to Ministers who must get important legislation through, and who cannot get it onto the Dáil schedule through the Business Committee or whatever other convoluted apparatuses they have. The Seanad is a lot more straightforward and streamlined in that regard. I encourage other Ministers to do exactly the same as our good friend, the Minister of State, has done here. I agree with the substantial elements of the Bill. Where amendments are necessary and important to enhance the Bill then they should happen. While I broadly welcome the Bill I would include the caveat that if a good amendment is tabled then it should be entertained and included. We have seen this happen time and again in this House, and hopefully we will see a lot more of it. It is extremely important that we drive on with this project. The children and families of Ireland deserve a centre of excellence for the care of children. The narrative and debate have taken place over years. Lots of different scenarios and controversies have engulfed the development of a state-of-the-art children's hospital. Had we advanced the project a few years ago it probably would have been built a lot cheaper when value for money was available. When it comes to children's health, however, and the provision of a state-of-the-art facility, value for money should not be an issue. It is value for money, whatever it costs. I am aware that a significant portion of the Bill is technical in nature and provides for giving staff their necessary rights. The project pulls together three very proud, traditional institutions that have provided fantastic care over the years. This poses technical and logistical challenges. The Bill will, hopefully, deal with the vast bulk of those matters. Even when the Bill gets over the line and is signed into law, unforeseen circumstances may present themselves and we should not be afraid to amend the legislation if such unforeseen circumstances present themselves. The facility needs to be accessible to all children, and I know it will be. We should be the best country in the world for looking after our children when they get sick. We should be the best country in the world for looking after our children anyway. When children get sick the apparatus of the State needs to be able to kick in straight away to provide the necessary interventions and healthcare to ensure all children, with minor or critical injuries, can return to the best possible health that medicine can provide. I commend all of the staff in the various hospitals. When I was a child I benefitted enormously from the children's unit in the Mater Hospital, and especially the eye unit. But for their work, dedication, care and attention to me during the four years I attended the children's eye unit in the Mater Hospital - after I had eye surgery in London - I would not have the limited eyesight that I have today. I hope that future generations of young people will be able to look back with great pride on the supports they receive from this new children's hospital. There is already a unit of the children's hospital up and running dealing with planning. Eilish Hardiman is doing an excellent job leading that team. I commend the work that Eilish and her team are doing. I agree with Senator Boyhan that it is important to get the Bill kick started before the recess. I sincerely hope that when we come back after the recess it will move on to Committee and Remaining Stages very quickly.

Living in the shadow of its construction, however, has caused a lot of angst among our neighbours within a 1 km circle around the site, but sin scéal eile for another day. The project is going ahead and we wish it well. We are all aware that it is so desperately needed. I commend the Minister of State for the work on the project to date, including this legislation. Having been involved with the project from the outset, once this site was announced we were all a bit nonplussed. The hearings at An Bord Pleanála for three weeks over the Christmas period in 2015 gave us a great insight into what lay ahead for residents, staff, children and their parents in order to get this right. Given the recent, horrific scandals within our health services, it is welcome to see that the purpose of the Bill is to strengthen governance. I am aware that the Minister of State takes this very seriously and it is clear that the Bill has elements of strategic planning behind it. We are looking to the future to ensure that we try to structure more accountability and public involvement. This is welcome. It is also essential in the overhaul of the existing pervading culture within the health service and in the delivery of health services. I have several queries and suggestions for the Bill. As this is the first chance for Senators to speak during the long journey of the Bill, I hope the Minister of State will hear our concerns and take time over the summer to consider the suggestions, which come from wanting to further strengthen the Bill. On community ownership and stakeholder involvement, the objectives and functions in Part 6 of the Bill are great but lack detail on how the objectives and functions will be met. How, for example, does the Minister of State envisage the views of children and young people will be managed regarding the development of delivery of services within the hospital? Will it be consistent throughout the development and opening of the national children's hospital? We need further information on that. Where is mental health and disability dealt with in the legislation? Will the national children's hospital have provisions to assist children with mental illness or disability? I am aware that some 20 beds will be for children with mental health needs, but I also refer to crisis situations. Tallaght and Blanchardstown hospitals will open satellite centres, which will encourage people to go to those units, and the national children's hospital on the St. James's Hospital site will take the most sick and serious cases.We need to figure out the 24 hour a day, seven days a week, services for mental health crises because children, like adults, present most often out of hours with these crises. How will they be factored into the centre for highly specialised paediatric care? This is a high level consideration that should be referred to within the objectives. Will the Minister of State please address these concerns today?  Sinn Féin has several practical and ideological concerns regarding finances. Sadly, it appears that the Fine Gael mantra of privatisation and relying on a charity model of health service will continue within our new health structures. This has proved disastrous for the HSE and it is a mistake to continue on this ideological path. If we want to overhaul children's health services we need to change. Hospitals should not have to continue focusing on profiteering, nor should they be balanced precariously by depending on people reaching into their pockets to donate. To depend on this for such a vital service is unsustainable. We all know of scandals that have had an impact on people's readiness to donate. What will the money generated through fundraising be used for? Will there be a specific guarantee that it will be used only for health reasons and not to top up the chief executive officer's, CEO, pay as happened in the past?  The Minister of State said the CEO can be required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. I will table an amendment to compel the CEO to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and to ensure there is no wiggle room in that respect.  Part 3 deals with the formation of the board of children's health Ireland. We would like the board to have 13 members, including one active representative of Dublin City Council, as is the case with the board of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. We need a council voice and patients' voices. Section 14 disbars a person serving more than two consecutive terms. We would prefer if it was two terms and not just two consecutive terms. We would appreciate clarity on the reasoning behind this element. Has the Department engaged with trade unions about the transfer of staff contracts and, if so, what was the outcome of such engagement? We would also like to see a reference to staff well-being, given the burnout rate of front-line staff in our chaotic health services. Including well-being as an objective for staff would be most helpful. We want the three properties that will be vacated, especially the one in Crumlin, to be kept in use for health service purposes. Can we get a commitment on that? Has the Department considered turning the Crumlin site into an elective-only hospital or step-down facility or using it for some form of health use given our capacity problems? I am led to believe that the covenant of Our Lady's Children's Hospital contains a term to the effect that it should operate only in the service of children's health. Will the Minister of State comment on that? I have been conducting an extensive consultation with the community on the future of the current children's hospital after it closes. I will reserve commenting on the results until the consultation is finished but I invite the Minister to work with me on this consultation and give the results serious consideration. The staff of Crumlin hospital and the people of Crumlin hold dear and are rightly proud of the service the hospital has given to all our nation’s children there since 1956. They are sad it will close and decamp to the St. James's Hospital site. Their concerns need to be taken into consideration. The Minister of State mentions the maternity hospital and says the planning and equipment will be provided by the board. I am unaware of planning permission being either sought or granted for this up to yesterday. Will the Minister of State let me know what is happening because that is a further development on the campus in which locals in the surrounding neighbourhood would be very interested?  Sinn Féin supports the Bill and asks that the Minister consider our suggestions and Committee Stage amendments. The new children's hospital is a prime opportunity to make a radical change in children’s health services. We need to get it right and we can push this Bill to do that. 
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	212	I thank the Senators who have spoken this afternoon. As one of the line Ministers under the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, I may not be able to deal with all the questions. However, I assure Senators and those in the Public Gallery that everything will be done to adhere to safety and accountability in all aspects of the new children's hospital, particularly in respect of funding and monitoring. To answer one of Senator Devine's questions, the CEO will be compelled to attend the Committee of Public Accounts. That is stated clearly. Regarding the services at the children's hospital in Crumlin, an area we both represent, a process has to take place before information can be relayed and I do not have that to give the Senator. However, I believe there have been talks. I thank Senator Martin Conway, who has left the Chamber, for his contribution. There is always great support in the Seanad. I am glad the Bill has started here. There are great concerns and the raw views too and I welcome them because it is important when I am asked to step in on behalf of the main Minister to hear the views. I assure all the speakers this afternoon that I will relay all the information and the officials will do the same. None of us wants to see our children or grandchildren having to wait on waiting lists. I believe that with the new children's hospital under one roof we will have a real opportunity to change forever the way children are treated, particularly as regards waiting lists. We all want to ensure that in the future children in Ireland will have a world class hospital that will cater for all their needs and that they will not have to be passed from one hospital to another when they need operations or other medical treatment. I agree with Senator Devine, however, that we need to take into account the number of young people, particularly very young people, who are suffering greatly from mental health problems. I believe that will have to be taken on board in the children's hospital.  In response to Senator Boyhan, the Tallaght charter motion will come before the House at the end of the year and before the legislation is commenced.  I thank the Members for their supportive and some less supportive comments on the legislation and the children’s hospital programme, all of which we will take on board. I am sure there will be plenty of time when we move to Committee Stage to consider amendments. As I set out earlier, the overarching objective of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new body whose key function will be to take over and run the services currently provided by the three children's hospitals in Dublin in state-of-the-art hospital facilities currently under construction. Concern for patients is the paramount reason for this investment by the State. The new hospital, outpatient and urgent care centres, along with the regional paediatric units in Limerick, Cork and Galway and local paediatric units, will work together to deliver a new model of care for paediatric services. This will see children receive the right care at the right time in the right location and, where possible, close to home. For those who need to access specialist services in Dublin, the co-location of the hospital with adult acute services and eventually the tri-location of the hospital with maternity services will result in patients, from infants to adolescents, being able to avail of the best clinical expertise on one campus. The new development will mean that children and parents will no longer have to travel between several hospitals for different aspects of their treatment. Parents will no longer have to sleep on the floor when spending the night in hospital with their sick child. Staff working in buildings that date back to Victorian times will be providing services in a modern building, where health and safety are paramount. As I also outlined earlier, the building element of this complex project is proceeding well. Construction works on the main site are continuing as planned. The construction of the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre at Connolly is also progressing as scheduled. The entire concrete structure is now complete and the centre is expected to open in summer 2019. Works at Tallaght are also progressing with the decant and creche works scheduled to be completed in august 2018 and the main works on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre is expected to commence in September 2018. The Tallaght centre is expected to open in summer 2020.  We all wish that will happen. There is no doubt in my mind that these urgent care centres of excellence for Connolly and Tallaght hospitals will be very much part of the overall approach of the new national children's hospital and the work that can be done in communities and in our new hospital. I welcome the fact that both of these centres are on time for completion. I do concur with some of the Senators' feelings around the extension of the completion date of the new children's hospital to 2022. However, as somebody who lives and works in the area, I can tell Members that on a daily basis, the amount of work that is being done at ground level is something the likes of which I have never seen. Everything possible is being done by the project team and the construction firm to complete the project by 2022, if not before.  It is important that we recognise the significant role of these outpatient and urgent care centres. The availability of consultant-led urgent care, with four to six hour observation beds, rapid access to outpatient clinics and diagnostics will mean that families and GPs can access a range services locally. While the buildings are important, equally essential are the staff and the services that are provided to the children and families for their care. The ongoing work on the operational integration of Ireland’s three children’s hospitals and preparation for the move to the new hospital, and the opening of the two outpatient and urgent care centres is a large and complex programme of work, with multiple stakeholders. This Bill provides the new entity with the effective governance authority and accountability to oversee that work. The approach to populating the first board of the new entity recognises the need to maintain continuity and organisational memory and to ensure that board members have the required competencies to undertake the leadership role required over the next few years. Accordingly, the children’s hospital group board will be the first board of children’s health Ireland. Its members appointed a year ago, were selected on foot of nominations and an open competitive Public Appointments Service process. The board includes a member from Northern Ireland and an international expert, representatives from the three children’s hospitals’ boards, and experts in patient safety, change management, law and corporate governance.  I wish again to commend and thank the staff and boards of the three hospitals coming together, as well as the board of the children’s hospital group for the vision and commitment they have shown to this project, and in getting it to the stage we are at here today. Anyone involved in the new children’s hospital project is embarked on a sea-change. This is particularly true of the staff of the three children's hospitals, some of whom have devoted decades of their lives to these institutions. Change can be challenging. I want to recognise today the commitment that staff, past and present, have given to the three hospitals and say that I understand that they may feel they are witnessing the end of an era, and a sense of loss. I want to assure them that the development of this Bill was mindful of the history of the three hospitals coming together and the Bill is reflective of their values of child-centred, compassionate and progressive care provided with respect, excellence and integrity. The Bill provides that staff will transfer to the new entity on terms and conditions which are no less beneficial than those to which they were subject before the transfer. In addition, there will be new opportunities for staff. We must never forget the ultimate prize for children and families and for the staff who care for them. The establishment of the new children’s hospital is the start of a new era, a unique opportunity which will enable us to tackle current and future challenges in children's health, which many Senators have acknowledged today, and to deliver on the huge advances that are possible in children’s healthcare.  I am confident that this legislation will put the right structure and approach in place to integrate the existing services and be prepared for the development of the best possible paediatric healthcare in the new facilities. I am confident that the Bill as proposed will provide this new entity with the powers and functions it needs both now and into the future to manage the transition to the new children’s hospital and provide services for children’s healthcare. It is therefore our hope that this Bill will progress through the Houses by the end of the year, in time to allow the new entity to be established and operational by year end, before the opening next year of the first outpatient and urgent care centre in Connolly.  I thank all Members of the House for their contributions and I look forward to the Bill being considered further on Committee Stage. With the contribution and cooperation of the Members of the House, I am confident that it will be possible to have it enacted without undue delay. Can I also acknowledge the fact that behind me are women who have worked on this project long before I came to the position I am in, and to acknowledge the Department's work with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on this. As a person who represents the area locally, I know the concerns that were raised with residents and I have spoken to them and to many people over the last weeks and months when the construction had started. There is a sea-change and it is not only for the children and their families, it is for a community as well. I want to acknowledge the huge input of residents in the area, the community and the support that has been given by the F2 Centre Fatima. I also acknowledge the work done on the ground in local schools and with youth groups by the project team with whom I had been in constant contact and worked with before I was given this job. I recently opened a flyover at the site with some of the students from Goldenbridge secondary school, and a drone went over the site and took some amazing pictures. One of these students said to me, and on the day it took me to a different place, she said: I never thought I would be part of something like this. My options have opened now and I am considering that I would like to work in medicine or maybe in this hospital when it is opened, and many of my friends are as well.That is an added bonus to the hospital being at this location, that people who are already living and working in the community will have jobs, will have careers in medicine, and all other aspects of serving children through our new paediatric hospital. I thank again all the Senators who made a contribution. Unfortunately I am not able to answer some of their immediate questions. I will, however, refer them to the Minister for Health. I am sure there will be many amendments forwarded as well which may be considered on Committee Stage. I thank the Chair and all of the Senators.

I welcome, in the main, the fact that the provision relating to audit exemptions, whereby companies can continue to apply to the District Court, has been amended. I was a registered auditor for many years and I have been approached by a number of practitioners in respect of this matter. Ireland is the only country in Europe where audit exemption is linked to a late filing date. If a person files one day late, he or she loses the audit exemption. Many of the small practitioners are no longer statutory auditors. They cannot afford to be. They have signed off. If they miss a filing date by one day, their client loses that exemption and they effectively lose a client. There are genuine cases. I have already indicated to the Minister and her Department that this might be looked at again at a later date whereby if there are genuine or exceptional cases whereby somebody falls ill or is late by a short period, an exception will be made and he or she will not lose the audit exemption. The Minister could examine the possibility of allowing a concession once every five years but, of course, repeat offenders would still lose the audit exemption. Having spoken to practitioners, I know that there are genuine cases. I am aware of one individual who was under enormous pressure. It would not take away from ensuring that people file on time if we were to offer a concession in this regard. If an accountant flagged to the Companies Registration Office a week or two weeks in advance that he or she was dealing with a particular situation - it might be necessary to include a criterion in this regard in the Bill - a once-off exception could be made. As already stated, this would apply once every five years and if the person involved were to file late on a second occasion, there would be no exception. This has significant ramifications for the small practitioner and also for his clients. Many of these practitioners are sole traders, in essence, and they operating as limited companies. What is involved here gives rise to a huge amount of added costs. We must consider not only what we wish to achieve by ensuring that people file on time but also the human aspect. I just wanted to put this matter on record. It can be dealt with at a later date, perhaps under other companies legislation. I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to contribute on Schedule 2.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	216	When it comes to filing annual returns and financial statements, I share the view that we must make it as straightforward as possible for all companies. That is why the law allows them up to 11 months to prepare and file financial statements. Last year, we legislated to simplify or reduce the content of those financial statements for small and micro-sized companies. The Companies Registration Office is upgrading its IT system to make it even easier for all companies to file on time. The aim is to move to a process that can be done in a single step and entirely online. These are practical solutions that will reduce even more the reasons for companies to be late. That said, I am happy to keep the current situation with regard to late filing under review. Once the Companies Registration Office's IT upgrade is complete it will be easier to obtain accurate information on the profile of the companies that are filing late, because what we do not want to do is accommodate repeat offenders in terms of not making their returns when they should. However, if we are to frame any exemption from the current timelines, we will need to consider it very carefully. As I mentioned, the current timelines are very fair and timely filing is certainly in the public interest. However, we are happy to look at this at a later date.

The reality is, however, that this Government Bill was scheduled to be guillotined on Committee Stage and move to Report and Final Stages. The Bill was initiated on 8 January last and passed by the Dáil on 10 July. I do not want to dwell on this because I support the Bill. It is the right thing to do. I am conscious that it is the end of term but, when he was in the House, the Taoiseach referred to how we can polish up legislation. He expects that of us. He challenged us and said that the main function of the Seanad is to enhance legislation and examine it critically on Committee Stage. I want to acknowledge that. I am particularly supportive of the Bill before us, which seeks to address each of the issues for which it makes provision. The Bill is important in terms of An Bord Pleanála's role in compulsory purchase and acquisition in order that IDA Ireland can get on with its primary function, namely, industrial development. I will not dwell on that matter. I simply want to put down a marker because it is important to do so. We have had a good deal of legislation before the Seanad today. It should not become the norm - I am not suggesting it will become the norm - that we do not have Committee Stage debates. We should go through the process of Committee Stage. We should not guillotine the debate on legislation. There were weeks and months during which we had very little debate on legislation. However, this is important legislation and I particularly want to support the Minister on it.

There is no guillotine on this Bill. There are no amendments to it. That is the reason it has been passed by the House so smoothly. It was debated in detail and approved in the Dáil. We had a full Second Stage debate in this House and there were no dissenting voices. It is an excellent Bill. It balances the need for IDA Ireland to be able to strategically plan and bring foreign direct investment into this country and at the same time protects Irish citizens and property holders from excessive use of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, sometimes in over enthusiastic circumstances. The Bill is excellent. It fulfils the court's order in respect of the landmark case in Kildare. I welcome it, thank the Minister for it and commend the Bill to the House.

The Bill would place some individuals at a disadvantage. I refer to students and persons starting out in life either going to university or in a first job. Two cases with which I am very familiar in my own county concern two widows, both of whom lost their husbands recently. They had never driven before and they live in an isolated part of rural Donegal. They require a car to go to church, mass, the post office or the shops. They got a learner permit and are in the process of applying for their full driver's licence. One of the women has already passed her theory test and is waiting for a date for a test but the delays are anything between 12 and 20 weeks. If the legislation were to pass, both of those individuals could find themselves in a very difficult position, especially if they were to borrow another person's vehicle. Currently, they can drive legally in another person's vehicle, which they have borrowed having obtained consent, if they are driving accompanied. Following the enactment of the Bill the person who owns such a vehicle would also be guilty of an offence. My intention is to try to provide a level of flexibility until such time as the testing process is faster. I appreciate that there are backlogs in the system for people who are waiting for a driving test. It is only natural that there would be backlogs because there are so many people applying, but nonetheless, there is an anomaly which I believe this amendment would address and provide reassurance to people. Amendment No. 2 proposes the insertion of paragraph (d) in section 5(2). The proposed wording includes: (d) it shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the driver of a mechanically propelled vehicle to show that they (i) have taken the requisite number of RSA approved driving lessons' [so they are fulfilling their obligations](ii) have taken all reasonable steps to acquire an RSA driving test, and(iii) are in possession of an NDLS issued Learner Permit. I am trying to accommodate those people. This is a particular issue in rural areas where many students may have to travel to college and they are learning to drive. Let us take as an example someone driving from Glencolumbkille to Letterkenny IT. It happens on a daily basis that people drive back and forth. They are coming through the system. They have the learner permit and they are waiting for a driving test, but if the Bill were to come into effect in September they would find themselves in great difficulty. The Bill also puts and extra responsibility on gardaí because they would have to enforce it in small rural areas. The Minister is penalising not only the learner permit holder but also the owner of a mechanically-propelled vehicle because such people are also guilty of an offence under this section. The Bill refers to "where a person, not being that owner, drives the vehicle in a public place at a time". Two people are being penalised - the owner of the vehicle and the learner permit holder in situations where, for example, a parent may give a car to a child who only has a learner permit. I am not sure what the Minister's thoughts are on the issue and if he is willing to consider accepting the amendment. It is tabled not to be confrontational in any way but to be constructive. This is an issue which I know will impact a lot of people, including the two widows of whom I am aware. There are hundreds of other such people as well. Very often, when people go through the experience of losing a partner, husband or wife and have not driven previously, they are in a situation where they either learn how to drive where there is no public transport or else they depend on taxis, which is very expensive. I have seen many instances where people begin to learn to drive themselves. There are those circumstances in addition to the situation with students. I am interested in hearing the Minister's thoughts on the amendment.

I fully support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Ó Domhnaill, who outlined the case very well. I understand the provisions are motivated by tragic circumstances that occurred some time ago and that the Minister reflected upon the representations he received in that regard. I understand why the provisions are in the Bill, but what Senator Ó Domhnaill is seeking is flexibility. He has outlined the case very well to show how a person in a rural area in particular would be affected if somebody has a learner driver permit, who has undertaken specific training that is provided by driving instructors accredited by the Road Safety Authority and the person is deemed competent to drive a car while waiting to sit a test. I understand the waiting times vary in different parts of the country but it ranges from five or six weeks to 25 weeks in some cases. The waiting period will get longer as a result of the huge volume of applications for driving tests. It could be up to 30 weeks. Until such time as that waiting list is reduced to a reasonable time period of four or five weeks it would be sensible to show some flexibility in that regard. All we are asking is that this provision in the Bill would not be enacted until such time as the waiting period has been reduced to a more reasonable level. If somebody undergoes a test and makes a major mistake, that is all the more reason for the person not to pass the test. However, tests can be failed for very simple technical reasons. If somebody is not successful in a test, he or she should not have to wait another 25 weeks or 30 weeks to take the test again. People should be given another opportunity as soon as possible, having undergone more driving instruction.They should be given another test within a very reasonable timeframe. This has a very negative impact on rural Ireland in particular. I understand where the Minister is coming from by including it in the Bill. I fully accept that. All we are asking for is a period of time for the Minister to get the driving test sector in order so people can receive a test within a very reasonable timeframe.  I thank the Minister again for coming to the House.

He is dead right. This is about safety. I have been asked by a number of people to support this amendment but I cannot. I will tell the House why. In all conscience, it is not right or proper. This is about safety. I have a great friend and colleague who lost not one but two sons in the Minister's constituency on a particular road very near UCD which I do not need to name. What does one say to a person who had two grown-up sons, who were happy and successful at sport and academia when both were tragically killed in traffic accidents outside the door of their home right beside UCD? What does one say to a person who every single day has to talk about the past of her two sons, her wonderful boys? It was about safety. Someone who thought they could drive but could not was in possession of a car in an area where one should only go 30 mph or 40 mph. It is about safety. I cannot support the amendment. I heard all the messages about people travelling and rural isolation. A councillor and colleague of mine talked about his children in Donegal who wanted to go to Derry. They were waiting for driving tests for months last year and they took the risk because one cannot go from Donegal into Derry and wait with teenagers all day to come back. There are problems there. I have had numerous rows, arguments and debates with the Minister on many issues. One of the issues I first raised when I came in here was the long delays with the RSA and recruiting instructors for driving tests.  The Minister handed me the latest statistics on driving test waiting times. I thank him for those. I will share some statistics with the House. The longest waiting time for cars is 26 weeks in Castlebar, 25 weeks in Cork, 24 weeks in Ennis, 26 weeks in Skibbereen and 21 weeks in Wicklow. The list goes on. We have a problem. We have to get resources in place. People should not have to wait any more than six or eight weeks.  I do not know how to address the issue but I want to support the Minister. I will not support the amendment. I will support this important legislation. The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 is long overdue. I read the schedule earlier today. The Bill was initiated on 13 July 2017 and passed through the Dáil on 6 July 2018. There were more than 17 days of debate on the Bill. All these arguments have been gone through before. Initially I thought there was a case to be answered but taking it all on balance, how can we allow a situation where people are in possession of a vehicle when either they do not have the proper authority to have one or have not passed the State driving test that is required of them by law? I do not think we can allow it to happen. We have to send a clear message that it is about road safety. I shared the story about those two people but when it happens to us and one of our loved ones is knocked down and taken from this world suddenly the whole thing changes. We have to get into the mindset and shoes of people who lost their loved ones as a result of inexperienced drivers or people endangering their lives or others in a vehicle. That is really important.  I am delighted this issue is about transport and falls directly into the Minister's portfolio. I am happy to support the Minister fully on this one because it is right. I caution the Minister to address the issue of people who are waiting months, particularly in rural Ireland, to do driving tests. The Minister has a function and role. If he gets his legislation through, he needs to commit to setting guidelines and to having a situation where people can apply for a test and do one within a reasonable period, which I think is about six weeks. If they fail and have to apply again, they should do it within another few weeks. Let us have everyone who wants to drive on the road driving safely.  I will not support the amendment. I will support the legislation.

Like my colleague, Senator Boyhan, we will not support the amendment although I sympathise with a lot of the sentiment expressed in it in terms of the socioeconomic, geographic, transportation and access issues. There is a very strong argument to be made in the broader sense but it is not for this legislation. It is a fight we will stand with Senators on on another day. Senator Boyhan put it very eloquently when he said the heart of this has to be about road safety. It has to be about protecting citizens and ensuring they are safe. It leaves us vulnerable if we start to create different standards of expectation for people who are going out to operate motor vehicles. I am not even sure how one would roll out the mechanics or implementation of this, who would qualify and who would not. It leaves us open to a moral and practical issue. While I sympathise with the issues expressed around rural Ireland and transportation and connectivity, I do not think it is an issue for today. In support of the sentiment behind the amendment, what it does is outline clearly the need for us to invest in greater rural transportation connectivity but, as Senator Boyhan outlined, the very clear need is to ensure there are not such delays in waiting times for driving tests. There is a very strong and compelling argument for the Minister to ensure waiting times are reduced for all the reasons expressed by previous speakers. If we succeed in doing that and allocate necessary and worthwhile resources to the legislation and ensure it is properly resourced, we will see those issues overcome in a much more feasible and practical way and, above all else, in a way that ensures greater safety, responsibility and competence on our roads.

As the Minister will recall, I supported the Bill on Second Stage. I support the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. It is very important. I agree with much of what my colleague, Senator Boyhan, has to say but I believe this amendment is worthy of support. When we are talking about driving, we are talking about a situation where law has evolved over the years. Fundamentally, there is a balance here between the liberty of citizens to go from one place to another and to make their way using modern means, particularly given the pressurised lives that people live. People have to get to work and young people have to get to college and work. People in more isolated parts of the country have particular needs that people in urban areas might find it more difficult to understand or relate to immediately. All of those are important issues that have to be considered in their own right. It is true that safety is a paramount consideration. Senator Boyhan rightly raised a case with which we can all empathise, a terrible tragedy and fatalities on our roads. It is right he should raise it but it is wrong that our attention should be arrested by such cases in a way that would cause us to cease further considering issues.I say that out of no lack of sympathy for the people directly involved. It is simply that we live in a world where tragedies happen. While accepting that we cannot always prevent tragedies from happening, we must do our level best to do so. That is why we have laws. Laws restrict our choices and limit our freedoms to the extent necessary to promote and secure the common good. That is the balance that always has to be struck in law. Laws should be kept to the minimum necessary to protect the vulnerable and secure our safety, always mindful that encroachments on liberty are not, in general, desirable. That is the balance that needs to be struck with law - respecting people's liberty. We have two Houses of Parliament to consider legislation thoroughly so that it neither falls short of the good that is to be achieved nor goes too far to the point where it restricts people's liberties in a way that is unacceptable or unfair. When I commended the Minister in the context of the Bill last week, I commended, in particular, his focus on the need for consistency and on the need for us to get serious with the problem of drink-driving. That has been the primary focus of this legislation. As I understand it, that is why the Bill was so long before the Lower House. It is interesting that the digest on the Bill supplied by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service is almost completely taken up with the drink-driving dimensions. That leads me to wonder if the same level of consideration has been given to the merits of the other aspects of the Bill we are discussing, such as people with learner permits driving unaccompanied. Does the Minister have the statistics and analysis to be satisfied that, all things considered, the particular measure, unamended, is really necessary to save lives? My Sinn Féin colleague commended Senator Ó Domhnaill. There is good sense and good intent behind the amendment. It seeks not to create some kind of free-for-all on the roads, but a defence to proceedings relating to an offence under this section. It is where a person has taken the requisite number of approved driving lessons, has taken all reasonable steps to acquire a driving test and is in possession of an NDLS-issued learner permit. We are talking about checks and balances. Senator Ó Domhnaill is not advocating some kind of free-for-all. He is advocating a reasonable restriction on prosecution where some other kind of social good is being served by a person being able to be on the road notwithstanding that they have not yet passed a test but provided that they have applied for a test and so on, subject to the other conditions. I do not really mind if the Minister wants to add to or subtract from those conditions in some way in order to reassure himself and the rest of us that there is not an unacceptable compromise in the context of public safety. The social good underlying this amendment should be acknowledged. A balance should be struck here. This is a very different question from that of introducing automatic suspension where people are driving over the permitted blood-alcohol limit; that is a horse of a different colour. We could do an injustice to Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment simply because it is amending legislation that deals with something of such profound importance as the problem of combatting drink-driving in our society. I ask the Minister to consider the amendment. I will support it on the basis that I believe it is not reckless or something that will compromise people's lives and safety. It is a sad fact that we have road accidents involving people who have not been drinking and who are in possession of driving licences, car insurance and all the rest of it. Experienced drivers end up having road accidents and tragedies occur on our roads. That is not a reason to ban driving. We are on a spectrum here. What Senator Ó Domhnaill is trying to achieve with this amendment merits support. It is not about supporting people who do not care whether they have a driver's licence or who are seeking to drive recklessly without regard for the law. It is about recognising that there are serious delays in getting a driving test. In such cases the driving public, particularly people in rural areas and young people who are taking this process seriously, who are taking their lessons and who have applied for a test ought to be facilitated. There is an injustice in creating an offence in the way that will happen if this amendment is not accepted. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. I will certainly support it.

The House is being constructive on this. The Minister was involved in a lot of unconstructive debate in the Lower House, but we have heard here some heartfelt points. As Senator Boyhan mentioned, people in many areas are waiting 26 weeks for a test. Somebody who unfortunately fails a test after 26 weeks may have to wait a further 26 weeks before getting another opportunity. That is a whole year before somebody would be able to drive unaccompanied. It would certainly help to tighten up this area. It is not a spurious claim. We are not trying to create devilment; it is a genuine concern. In my area, a chap on an apprenticeship who was aware of the amendment contacted me. He has a learner permit and is waiting to get to sit his test. If he fails, he could have inconvenience for up to a year before getting a full licence. In this case, what is he going to do? Will he have to travel by bike? He is certainly more likely to be involved in some kind of accident when travelling by bike or walking. I ask the Minister to give the amendment serious consideration.

I do not doubt the intent of any of the contributors so far. It is an important discussion to have. For me, the issue becomes very black and white. I am conscious that there are people in the Gallery who have lost loved ones. None of us wants to see tragedy or accidents on our roads. However, we need to make a call on the issue. We need to set a certain standard and a certain expectation. While there is a list of things that people may have obtained that would be included in this amendment, what they do not have is the passing of the driving test. That has to be the bare minimum. It must be the standard that we come to expect of drivers, otherwise we will leave ourselves very vulnerable and open if, God forbid, an accident or a tragedy occurs on our roads. I think we have to reflect on that when we are seeking to put this legislation through. I do not doubt that colleagues are sincere in their efforts to get this amendment through.We could channel our collective political will to address the broader societal issues of delays in accessing driving tests and the lack of proper public transportation in our rural communities in a much better way than simply saying that there will be a lesser standard or lesser redress should it come to pass that somebody breaks the law, commits an offence and somebody is hurt or loses his or her life. We are leaving ourselves very vulnerable and setting a precedent that is not right.

I also mentioned the fantastic work the families have done by supporting the Minister in bringing the legislation forward. I hope there will be additional resources for people applying for their driver licences. Other Senators have raised that and it must be addressed. The day when people thought it was acceptable to drive with drink taken, even one glass, is long gone. It is better not to touch alcohol at all if one is driving. Looking at the statistics for the last six months there is a worrying trend in the number of deaths on our roads. Some 70% of them have been young people. It emphasises the importance of this legislation. On my behalf and on that of the other Labour Party Senators, I apologise to the families who had to sit through the filibustering that occurred in the Lower House. It was disgraceful that they had to sit through that knowing that the legislation will save lives. I am aware of the sheer annoyance they must have experienced. I hope there is a speedy process this afternoon and, hopefully, the Bill will wing its way to the President for signature so it can be enforced later in the summer.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	236	I sincerely thank the Senators for their contributions, both today and on Second Stage. This has been a serious, mature, considered and worthwhile debate. I cannot say the same for the Lower House, as has been mentioned here. We managed to thrash out some of the more important arguments here in a serious and reasoned way and we have been able to take points of view on board in a tranquil and unhysterical atmosphere. Senator Humphreys put his finger on it - we are nowhere near winning this battle against deaths on the roads. Today, the numbers are up four on last year despite the enormous measures being taken. There are many reasons given for that, including the fact that there is more traffic on the roads, but the figure of four more than last year is utterly unacceptable. We have no cause for satisfaction. That is the motivation behind this Bill and behind the support for the Bill. It is the motivation of the families in the Visitors Gallery, who are here to ensure that what happened to them will never happen to anybody else. That is a noble calling, and many Senators referred to it. This Bill would not have got so far without those families pursuing it to what, I hope, will be the end tonight. I will not accept Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment but I thank him for introducing it. I sympathise with it in many ways because the motivation behind it is genuine. He and Senator Wilson made similar comments, obviously articulating the real worries in rural Ireland about the effects of this amendment and the difficulties that people there have. However, as Senator Ó Donnghaile stated, we must have a measure. We cannot make exceptions for people when they are not safe on the roads or let them through for any reason. They are driving a killer vehicle. That is the reason I cannot accept the amendment, despite the fact that I know the reasons behind it perfectly well. The driver testing presents a problem which I have to address, and I will address it in response to this amendment from Senator Ó Domhnaill. We are addressing it, although not fast enough for the Senator or for me. I am certainly on the Senator's side on this but I do not see the logic of being on his side to such an extent that I make the roads unsafe for innocent people. I cannot take the extra step he is asking me to take, although I accept the reason he has given as to why I should. Today, in a measured way, the Senator brought that argument further into prominence. It was raised by Senator Boyhan previously and by Members of the Lower House. Quite honestly, in the last half hour or so we have seen a better case made by Senator Ó Domhnaill and the other Members who supported what is proposed than was made in six months in the other House, where the Members temporarily ruined the case they were making for improving the number of driver testers and reducing the waiting lists. When there is the type of histrionic behaviour that occurred there the argument gets lost. I thank the Senator for bringing the argument back centre stage. While I will not accept the amendment, I am going to address the problems he raised and which are accepted by all sides of the House. I thank Senator Boyhan for his support. I must say I am sorry I gave him that piece of paper when I came here as he used it immediately to beat me.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	238	That is fair enough. The Senator provided some examples which highlight the difficulties that exist. He quoted the longest waiting time in every case, and I do not blame him for that because it is the rhetoric of the argument. However, the average waiting time is under half what he quoted at 12.4 weeks. It is decreasing, but not fast enough for anybody. It would be far more acceptable if it was down to single digits. That is our objective and I hope the measures the RSA is introducing will do that. There is a danger, as one Senator mentioned, that there would be a balloon or spike when this measure goes through if people are seeking to pass their tests in a hurry, but we will see. I thank Senator Davitt. What he said was constructive. I do not agree with his view on it but, again, he is articulating something which should be said. Senator Mullen, too, in a cerebral way, introduced the social difficulties which some measures bring to rural Ireland. We have addressed that in a concrete way already by introducing the Local Link buses. That is a pilot scheme that has been introduced in 17 counties. It is not a panacea, it is a pilot. We will examine it after three months by getting an interim report and after six months we will see where changes should be made and whether or how it is successful. The anecdotal evidence coming to my office is that the pilot scheme is certainly revealing a huge pent-up demand, and satisfying it in some cases, for people to go out at night and get back home. It is not just about going to the pubs. A gap is being filled. It is about people playing bingo, going to dances and just making social visits.It is also about people going to pubs and back. Certainly, there appears to be a major appetite for it and there has been a good response in the areas where I have heard about it. Five local areas did not apply in the original round but since then they have all applied for the type of Local Link bus at night and in later evenings. We will find that it is doing a service. Certainly, it is experimental but it will be continued if it is working, and the evidence is that it is working. I cannot accept the amendment from the Independent Senator Ó Domhnaill because I cannot accept the principles behind it. I have some difficulty with the wording as well. First, I will explain the problem with the principle. It is illegal for learners to drive without a qualified accompanying driver. This has been illegal since 2007. The reason is clear: driving is a serious responsibility and we do not let people drive unaccompanied until they can prove via a driver test that they are sufficiently competent to do so. If anyone can find a better way of proving it, then let them come forward. This is in the interests of the learners as well as other road users. I have heard the suggestion several times during the passage of the Bill that we should somehow go softer on this ruling in cases where people have had trouble getting an early driver test. I have said before that I am not satisfied with the delays that people can face in getting a test. The Road Safety Authority has a target of an average of ten weeks for the waiting time. Earlier this year, the average was approximately 14 weeks and it is now down a little to 12.4 weeks. That is not enough but it is on a downward trend. Admittedly, 14 weeks is still 40% longer than the target. The latest figures, as of this week, indicate an average wait of 12.4 weeks. There is a downward trend and the RSA is working to speed this up. Additional tests are being provided by existing testers and new testers are being recruited. There is also authorisation for further testers to deal with any surge in applications if, as some suspect, there will be a surge after the passage of this Bill. None of this justifies people breaking the law by engaging in the highly risky behaviour of driving as unaccompanied learners. Too often, people seem to think that a learner permit is a licence. I hear people asking how learners are to get to college or to work if there is action taken to stop unaccompanied learners. I am sorry, but the law is clear here. The answer is that they are not supposed to act illegally by driving unaccompanied and putting themselves and other road users at risk. A learner permit is a permit to drive for the purposes of learning and no more. It is not a licence to drive freely on our roads and it should never be treated as if it was. Senator Ó Domhnaill is proposing an amendment to the provision known as the Clancy amendment. It gets its name because of the tragic case of a mother and daughter, Geraldine and Louise Clancy, who were killed in December 2015 when their car was hit by a car driven by an unaccompanied learner. The substance of the Clancy amendment is that owners of vehicles who let unaccompanied drivers drive their vehicles should bear a share of responsibility. Senator Ó Domhnaill's proposal would mean that the owner would get off if the learner doing the unaccompanied driving had completed the mandatory 12 lessons and had taken reasonable steps to obtain a driving test. If we accepted this, we would in effect be saying that there is a principle in law, but that it would be all right to break it if these criteria were met. In the case of the Clancys, the driver who caused the collision admitted that she took a bend at too high a speed and lost control of the vehicle. I have no idea whether she had taken 12 lessons or had a booking for a test, but how would it be relevant in a case like this if she had? Are we to say that in future the responsibility of owners who facilitate illegal unaccompanied driving will be void simply because the driver has had some lessons and tried to get a driving test? I have no doubt that some learners are good drivers. Likewise, I have no doubt that some learners are not. The only way we can be sure is by testing them. Until then, we can hardly take the fact that they have done lessons and applied for a test as proof that they are fit to drive unaccompanied. On principle, I cannot accept that we should go soft on people who break the law. I mentioned that I have a difficulty with the wording of the amendment. I will be brief about it. The section into which this amendment would be inserted relates to owners allowing their vehicles to be driven by unaccompanied learners or by unlicensed drivers. The criteria in the amendment that would allow people to get off include not only the driver having taken the requisite lessons and reasonable steps to obtain a driving test, but also the driver holding a learner permit issued by the National Driver Licence Service. It is proposed that this be inserted in a section under which an owner of a vehicle will face charges if he allows an unaccompanied learner or an unlicensed driver to drive his vehicle. Whether Senator Ó Domhnaill intends it, his amendment would apply to both of these cases because he refers to it being a defence to an offence under the section. I note that the person would have to have a learner permit but not necessarily a currently valid learner permit. This is a crucial flaw. If the Senator means his amendment to apply to unaccompanied learner cases only, then a reference to a learner permit is redundant. As framed, however, it would mean that if a person was unlicensed but had an out-of-date learner permit and met the other criteria, then the owner would be let off. This might apply if the driver had done the lessons at some point and had tried at some point to get a driving test. I do not believe this is what Senator Ó Domhnaill intends but would actually be the effect of the amendment. In summary, I cannot on principle accept an amendment that would write into the law that we did not much mind if learners drove unaccompanied so long as they had taken their lessons and tried to get a test. If the House was minded to do this, I would have to point out that the amendment before us today is a seriously flawed way to do it. Therefore, I call on the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment. In doing so, I wish to recognise the seriousness with which the House is taking the amendment and the Bill as well as the serious way it is being debated. It has highlighted several issues. I give absolutely no ground whatsoever on the principles of road safety, on ridding us of the scourge of drink driving or on the principles enunciated today. I recognise that this Bill is a fine one and I am sure it will save lives. However, I recognise that it has thrown up problems and has managed to allow people to highlight problems that exist in a responsible way. These are problems we are determined to address. I thank Senator Ó Domhnaill for bringing forward the amendment.

One thing is for certain, and I want to thank all the contributors, including those who are supportive of, and those who may not find their way to support, the amendment, I respect all the views because we live in a democracy and it is important in a Chamber such as this that we would have a reflective debate on all issues, including this particular Bill. The Bill is well-drafted, well-meaning and well-established. I thank the Minister for his contribution. Of course he is no stranger to this House having spent one or two years here during the course of his political career. I thank the Minister also for other work that he is doing to improve the safety of our roads. That work sometimes goes unnoticed but it includes the funding he is providing throughout the State, not only in one or two areas, to improve our road network. That is welcome and I thank him for that. I appreciate fully that the Minister cannot accept the amendment. Of course, the purpose behind the amendment is one of trying to be constructive. I am not questioning any other element of the Bill save for this particular area, which would appear to be a great cause of concern where there is a lack of public transport in rural parts of the country. I thank the Minister for his constructive approach. I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve not only through this Bill but across other public policy areas within Government where he is challenging vested interests. That is welcome.

I was a Minister myself. The Minister will decide when the sections of the Bill will come into force. I commend the Minister on the provision of the rural transport scheme, the pilot scheme, which he has brought forward at 17 locations. I am suggesting that to combat rural isolation, this scheme be studied and extended to other areas so that people can get together and ask how it can work. I am asking the Minister to provide this scheme so that the groups of publicans in rural areas could come together and decide the strategy for implementing this scheme to provide transport to and from rural pubs, which will be affected by the legislation. From my observations, I see so many people bringing their families to and from places of entertainment so there is a very real understanding of that. I see it at first hand. I commend those people who provide that service for families, neighbours and friends, so there is a realisation of the situation. Will the Minister extend the scheme to areas like County Roscommon and does he have any responsibility in that regard? Will he allow a bit of time for it? As he said, it is a pilot scheme that will be reviewed in three months and six months. He should give people an opportunity to work through this. For example, it could involve the purchase of a minibus less registration tax or some scheme that will assist in this regard. That is all I want to say on this section. In fairness, we were delayed coming in.

I hope that, after he reviews it, he may be in a position to extend it and make good connections not only for rural pubs but for the local GAA team and all the points he outlined in the earlier debate. That the Minister delays the implementation of this Bill is the intention of the Senator. I urge the Minister not to do this but to sign it as quickly as possible because the facts show that the loss of life is far greater in rural Ireland than it is in our cities. The purpose of this Bill is to protect people in rural Ireland. If we look at the likes of Donegal, we can see it has a huge impact in terms of the loss of life. I believe the Bill will be passed today and I believe it will be signed by the President. The Minister should certainly not delay in implementing the legislation because implementing legislation to save lives is what we are about in this House.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-07-17 00:00:00	Order of Business	270	I thank Senator Humphreys. I have no intention of delaying the implementation of this Bill. It has been delayed long enough. It has been delayed unnecessarily and we will expedite it as quickly as possible. Senator Leyden is right and wrong. In my comments on the amendment, I said that five out of 17 local areas - do not crucify me if I am wrong - did not apply for the first round of the rural transport scheme. I think Roscommon was among those areas. It was probably for no reason; it was very short notice. There might have been perfectly understandable reasons. They were not in the first round of allocations. Since then, every single local scheme that did not apply for its own reasons has applied, so if Roscommon has applied, which it must have done or Local Link for Roscommon must have applied, it will now be on the list for inclusion. In response to Senators Humphreys and Leyden, this is a pilot scheme. It is not written in stone that the routes being used at the moment will be there forever. My clear intention is that if it is seen to be working, and I think the initial indications are that it is getting a very good response, it should be expanded because we recognise, as I said a few minutes ago, that one of the issues thrown up by this Bill is rural isolation. There is no doubt that social isolation is there in Roscommon and elsewhere and we recognise that it must be addressed. That is what the pilot scheme is about. I see this as something that will be extended if it works and is used because it is meeting the needs of people throughout rural Ireland. I thank the Senator for his intervention. It is useful in respect of this issue because it gives us an opportunity to discuss it and for the Senator to come back and say where it is and is not working. Once the pilot is over, which is some time in December, we will look at it to change the routes or times, if necessary, and extend it or reduce it in certain areas. That is what it is about. If Roscommon has not yet been addressed, it will be.
