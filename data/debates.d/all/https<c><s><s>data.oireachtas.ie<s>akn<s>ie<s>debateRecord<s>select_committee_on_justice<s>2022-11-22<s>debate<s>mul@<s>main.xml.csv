I also welcome the members of the committee. The meeting has been convened to consider Committee Stage of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 and the Minister of State is here for that purpose. Some members may attend remotely and I ask everybody to note that if a division is called, members must be physically present in the committee room. Before we debate the Bill section by section, perhaps the Minister of State wishes to make some opening remarks.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022. This Bill introduces a number of important reforms in the law across a broad range of areas. These amendments reach across many aspects of people's lives and have the potential to make a real difference. I acknowledge that there are a large amount of amendments to this Bill. A large number of the amendments before the committee today were heads included in the original published general scheme that required further drafting and were not ready when the Bill was published. These include court-related amendments that will facilitate centralisation and automation of certain court offences and processes. This is part of a suite of measures my Department continues to introduce, which will improve access to justice and modernise the courts system. The volume also reflects the desire to use the opportunity that a miscellaneous provisions Bill brings to make the necessary corrections and updates to various legislation that otherwise would take significantly more time to progress and delay the delivery of the reform needed. The Bill includes amendments across a diverse range of areas, including bankruptcy, Irish nationality and citizenship, international protection, immigration, legal services, data protection and third-party funding. The amendments proposed by this Bill will have a positive impact on citizens, assist in making our courts and legal services more accessible, update the civil justice legal framework and further modernise and reform. It is intended to bring forward a small number of further amendments on Report Stage. These are amendments that require some further drafting and were not ready for today. They include amendments to section 46 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 and a new section 61B; amendments to the Data Protection Act 2018 on the enforcement of third-party beneficiary rights, confidentiality obligations and the issuance of reprimands; amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 to provide for a change to the levy model of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA; some additional amendments to courts legislation in relation to matters, including court officers; and an amendment to section 14 of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020. Officials are examining a number of further matters concerning naturalisation and citizenship. Amendments may also be brought forward enabling Tusla to apply for naturalisation on behalf of a child who is in care, under the Child Care Act 1991, to make provision in the continuous residence provisions for cases where the absence of a child from the State was connected with the situation of a child's guardian or of a person in loco parentis to the child and to provide for any further minor amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, arising from amendments brought forward from today. I wanted to alert committee members to those further amendments that may be necessary or brought forward on Report Stage and which, unfortunately, we were not in a position to introduce today.

#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Committee Stage	3	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following: “(2) The Civil Liability Acts 1961 to 2017 and Part 3 may be cited together as the Civil Liability Acts 1961 to 2022.”. This group of amendments amends the Civil Liability Act 1961 and relates to a new power for the Minister to make regulations in relation to periodic payment, indices and how it is to be applied. The substantive amendment is amendment No. 14, which provides for a replacement of the current section 51L of the 1961 Act. As Deputies will be aware, section 51L of the Civil Liability Act 1961, as inserted by the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, deals with the issue of the indexation of periodic payment orders, otherwise known as PPOs. The section provides for the annual adjustment of a payment under a PPO in line with the prevailing rate under the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. In addition, the section provides for a review of the application of the index after a five-year period to determine its suitability for use in PPOs. If, following the review, an alternative index is considered to be more suitable for the purpose of the PPOs, the Minister may, by regulation and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, specify an alternative index for use in adjusting payments under a PPO. This section also provides for reviews of the suitability of the relevant index at five-year intervals. In November 2019, at a directions hearing, the High Court found that there was overwhelming evidence that a PPO linked to the HICP would result in under-compensation. The expert evidence presented to the court indicated that the annual amount needed to be linked to a wage-based index to ensure full compensation for future care needs. The court indicated that the HICP should no longer be used in such cases. The effect of the High Court decision was that PPOs are not being pursued despite general agreement among all parties that a PPO is often the best solution for plaintiffs and defendants in such cases. In order to address the effect of the High Court decision, I have decided that it is necessary to amend existing legislation to delete the reference to the HICP. I am also taking the opportunity to substitute an alternative and more flexible mechanism for determining the PPO indexation rate. Amendment No. 14 gives effect to this policy decision. The amendment provides that the existing section 51L will be replaced by a new section, which essentially provides that the indexation rate for PPOs will be set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Subsection 1 sets out the general rule that a periodic payment order will be adjusted on an annual basis by reference to an index specified under the section and this index will be termed "a periodic payments index". Subsection 2 provides that an indexation rate shall be set out in regulations by the Minister for Justice for the consent of the Minister for Finance. Subsection 3 specifies in detail the issues that the Minister for Justice must consider. Subsection 4 provides for a review of the index and the general rule that the review must be carried out within five years of the making of the regulations setting the index rate.However, it is my view that we need flexibility in the determination of the index. We have seen rapid increases in inflation in the past year. It will be necessary to ensure that a periodic payment index is capable of being reviewed in the event of further significant changes in economic circumstances. Subsection 5 provides for the carrying out of subsequent reviews of the periodic payments index. Subsection 6 is a standard provision relating to the laying off regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection 7 identifies the scope of the new index which will apply to the annual adjustment to be made to the PPOs after commencement of the section. I take the view that in order to ensure the best outcome for those who have been catastrophically injured, we should put in place a specific index dealing solely with PPOs. However, this will take some time and a great deal of development work by the Central Statistics Office. In that circumstance, I do not believe that it is in anyone's interest to leave the situation as it currently stands. It is my intention, therefore, to set an interim rate for use in PPOs. This rate will include elements covering general inflation and crucially, given the High Court decision, wage inflation. To assist me in determining the appropriate rate, I have established a working group to advise me on the most appropriate rate in the current circumstances. Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 to 13, inclusive, are consequential amendments arising from the replacement of section 52L of the 1961 Act. Amendments Nos. 1 and 9 are technical amendments, while amendment No. 10 provides that the periodic payments index has the meaning assigned to it in section 51L. Amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, replace existing terminology in legislation with a reference to a periodic payments index.

Section 14 is the important one here. It deals with people in very difficult circumstances who have very serious injuries and need to continue to return to court to get their annual payment determined if it needs to be adjusted due to inflation. We should do anything we can to ease that both for the unfortunate individuals but also for the courts system because it is unnecessary to have that continue. We have no problem supporting this group of amendments.

#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Committee Stage	6	I move amendment No. 2:In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Amendment of section 2 of Act of 1956
3. Section 2 of the Act of 1956 is amended by the insertion of the following definition:“ ‘citizenship ceremony’ means a ceremony held—(a) before a judge, or a retired judge, of the District Court, Circuit Court, Court of Appeal, High Court or Supreme Court or such other person as may be designated for that purpose by the Minister, and(b) at a place and in a form approved by the Minister,at which an applicant makes the declaration and gives the undertaking in accordance with section 15(1)(e), section 15A(1)(h) or section 15B(1)(d), as the case may be;”.”.I am introducing amendments to 1956 Act to reduce from five years to three years the number of years' residence required for someone born in this State to become eligible for citizenship by naturalisation. This will allow children who are currently on a pathway to Irish citizenship to obtain that status at an earlier stage. It has been a cause of concern for some people that children born in Ireland to non-Irish parents do not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship from birth. The Government believes that providing a shorter pathway to citizenship is the right thing to do for these children. The amendment also provides a clear and specific procedure that will apply where a citizenship application is made for a child. I am also introducing a new section to be inserted in the 1956 Act to make further and clear provision for the continuous residence condition for naturalisation. This matter was the subject of judgments by the High Court and the Court of Appeal in 2019, in the case of Jones v. the Minister for Justice and Equality. I am also introducing an amendment to section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. The purpose of amendment No. 2 is to insert a definition of "citizenship ceremony" into the definitions section of the 1956 Act so that the definition will apply to the entire Act, including the new provisions to be introduced by the Bill. The existing definition in section 50 of the Act will be deleted. Amendment No. 3 seeks to remove an anomaly that has been identified in the provisions of section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 relating to the entitlement to Irish citizenship of grandchildren of Irish citizen officials posted abroad in the public service. This specific issue, which has been brought to the attention of my Department, relates to the entitlement to Irish citizenship in cases where children were born outside Ireland to Irish citizens who were working abroad in the public service and subsequent generations are also born outside Ireland. The anomaly that has been identified is that under section 7, as it currently stands, grandchildren of Irish-born Irish citizen officials posted abroad in the Irish public service are in a less favourable situation than grandchildren of foreign-born Irish citizen officials posted abroad in respect of automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship by descent if born outside Ireland in the requirement for registration in the foreign birth register maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Amendment No. 4 provides for amendments to section 15 of the 1956 Act which provides the conditions for issue of a certification of naturalisation. Amendment No. 6 is the main amendment in this group. The purpose of this new section 15B is to reduce the residence requirements for naturalisation for children born in the State to three years from the current five years and to improve the clarity of the procedure for applications for certificates of naturalisation for minors. Section 15(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, which has been amended on several occasions since its enactment, provides that as one of the conditions for naturalisation, the applicant must have had one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and four years' residence during the eight years preceding that. The effect of the proposed new section 15B will be to change the residence requirement for minors born in the State. The current four-year residence requirement will change to two years. The requirement for one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application continues to apply. The amendments, in effect, will replace a five-year residency requirement for minors with a three-year residency requirement. The new section 15B also makes specific provision for the conditions of naturalisation that will apply to minors. The application of the good character condition to minors was the subject of the 2019 High Court judgment where the court held that it is the character of the minor that must be considered and not that of the parent or a guardian of the minor who makes the application for naturalisation on the minor's behalf. The new section 15B will clearly address the issues arising from that judgment. For consistency with the provision of the Children Act 2001 relating to criminal responsibility of children, the new section proposes that the good character condition will only apply to a minor under the age of 14 in the rare cases where the minor has been charged with or convicted of a most serious homicide or sexual offence. Minors under the age of 14 will not be required to make a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State or to undertake to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values. This is in line with current practice. It will be possible for the requirement or the good character condition to be waived in respect of a minor aged 14 or over if it is considered appropriate to do so having regard to the particular circumstances of the minor concerned. The new section restates the existing requirement that an application for naturalisation in respect of a minor is to be made on behalf of the minor by his or her parent or guardian or by a person who is in loco parentis to him or her. In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my officials continue to examine the possibility of enabling Tusla to apply for naturalisation on behalf of a child who is in care under the Child Care Act 1991. It is hoped this matter can be addressed on Report Stage. The purpose of the new section 15C is to make further provision relating to the continuous residence conditions for naturalisation set out in sections 15 and 15A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. It has been established practice and policy to permit applicants for naturalisation to spend some time away from Ireland in any one year without it affecting their application, including in the year immediately preceding the date of application for naturalisation. The continuous residence condition of naturalisation was the subject of a High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in 2019 in the case of Jones v. the Minister for Justice and Equality. I believe that legislation is necessary to put this matter on a clear statutory footing. The new section 15C provides that absences totalling a standard 70 days, as well as up to 30 additional days necessitated in certain defined exceptional circumstances, will not impact on an applicant's compliance with the continuous statutory residence requirement. For minors, the intention is that the specified exceptional circumstances could only apply to a minor applicant in his or her own right, for example, if he or she had to go abroad for medical treatment or for educational reasons. Specific provision is made for cases where a minor applicant is absent from the State due to circumstances applying in respect of his or her parent or guardian. While it is not possible to pre-empt every eventuality that may arise, it is considered that these provisions are reasonable and balanced and afford flexibility to applicants for naturalisation. The definition of family is broad and includes spouses and civil partners, cohabitants, children, siblings, parents, step-parents, grandparents, children, aunts and uncles. The new section 15D is consequential on the new sections 15B and 15C. The new section 15E contains transitional provisions to ensure where an application for naturalisation is made before commencement of this Act but has not been determined, the applicant may benefit from its provisions. Amendment No. 71 provides for amendments to the Long Title of the Bill to reflect these amendments.

“Naturalisation of minors born in State and other matters
7. The Act of 1956 is amended by the insertion of the following sections after section 15A:
“Naturalisation of minors born in State
15B. (1) Upon receipt of an application under this section for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of a minor, the Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, grant the application if satisfied that the minor—(a) was born in the State,(b) subject to subsection (2), is of good character,(c) has had a period of one year’s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to two years, and(d) subject to subsection (3), has, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows—(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and(ii) undertaken, in the prescribed manner, to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.(2) Where a minor is under 14 years of age on the date of his or her application under this section for a certificate of naturalisation, the condition at paragraph (b) of subsection (1) shall apply to him or her only where he or she—(a) is charged with, and is awaiting trial for, or(b) is or has been convicted of,murder, manslaughter, rape, rape under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 or aggravated sexual assault within the meaning of section 3 of that Act.(3) The condition at paragraph (d) of subsection (1) shall not apply to a minor who is under 14 years of age on the date of the application for a certificate of naturalisation.(4) The Minister may, in his or her absolute discretion, waive the conditions at paragraph (b) or (d), or both, of subsection (1) in respect of a minor who is 14 years of age or over on the date of the application for a certificate of naturalisation, if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the particular circumstances of the minor concerned.(5) An application under this section in respect of a minor shall be made on behalf of the minor by his or her parent or guardian, or by a person who is in loco parentis to him or her.
Calculation of continuous residence for purposes of sections 15, 15A and 15B
15C. (1) When calculating a period of one year’s continuous residence in the State for the purposes of section 15 or 15B, the periods specified in subsection (3) during which—(a) an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation under section 15, or(b) a minor (in this section referred to as a ‘minor applicant’) in respect of whom an application for a certificate of naturalisation is made under section 15B, was not present in the State shall be reckoned as a period of residence in the State.(2) When calculating a period of one year’s continuous residence in the island of Ireland for the purposes of section 15A, the periods specified in subsection (3) during which an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation under that section was not present in the island of Ireland shall, subject to subsection (4), be reckoned as a period of residence in the island of Ireland.(3) The following periods are specified for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2):(a) a period not exceeding, or periods the aggregate of which do not exceed, 70 days, and(b) an additional period not exceeding or such additional periods the aggregate of which do not exceed, 30 days, where the Minister is satisfied that the person’s not being present in the State or in the island of Ireland, as the case may be, during such additional period or periods was necessitated by—(i) in the case of a minor applicant, exceptional circumstances relating to the minor applicant, or the person who made the application on his or her behalf, or both, and(ii) in any other case, exceptional circumstances relating to the person.(4) Where section 15A(4) applies to an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation, the periods specified in subsection (3) shall be in addition to any period of residence outside the island of Ireland referred to in section 15A(4).(5) In this section—‘day’ does not include part of a day;‘exceptional circumstances’, in relation to a person not being in the State or the island of Ireland, means one or more of the following:(a) the family or personal circumstances of the person;(b) the health requirements of the person or of a family member of the person;(c) requirements arising out of, or in the course of the employment, trade or profession of the person;(d) requirements in pursuance of a course of study or a professional qualification of the person;(e) any voluntary service by the person for humanitarian purposes;(f) such other circumstances resulting in the person’s not being present in the State or in the island of Ireland, as the case may be, as the Minister considers to be outside the control of the person;‘family member’, in relation to a person, means—(a) the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the person,(b) a child, son-in-law or daughter-in-law of the person,(c) a parent, step-parent, mother-in-law or father-in-law of the person,(d) a brother, sister, step-brother, step-sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, half-brother or half-sister of the person,(e) a grandparent or grandchild of the person, or(f) an aunt, uncle, nephew or niece of the person.
Saver for certificates of naturalisation

“Fees payable on declaration
3. The Act of 1956 is amended by the substitution of the following section for section 30:
“Fees payable on declaration
30. (1) Subject to subsection (2), whenever any person is by this Act required or empowered to make a declaration for the purposes of this Act, regulations made under this Act may require that such person shall pay, on the making of such declaration, such fee as may be prescribed.(2) Regulations to which subsection (1) applies shall not require the payment of a fee exceeding the maximum fee chargeable pursuant to regulations made under the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993 for the issue of a passport to a person aged 18 years or over.”.”.I do not wish to speak to the amendment at length. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on it.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Committee Stage	14	Amendment No. 8 proposes to replace section 30 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. That section provides that, whenever any person is required or empowered by the Act to make a declaration for the purposes of Act, regulations made under the Act may require that such a person shall pay, on the making of such declarations, such fees as prescribed. No regulations have had to be made under section 30 to prescribe fees for the purpose of that section to date. It is not clear to me, therefore, what the intention of this amendment is. The fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011, SI 569 of 2011, which were made in exercise of the ministerial powers conferred by section 3 of the 1956 Act. The application fee stipulated at €175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation, and a certification fee is payable on the issue of certification of naturalisation. The standard certification fee is set at €950, with a reduced fee of €200 applying in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or, in certain cases, when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons, there is no certification fee. The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour that confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at a European Union level. It is important the appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to affect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation, which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process. All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 8.

It is an issue that has come up, particularly for people who have been living in this State for a long time and have been paying taxes in the State. When they go looking for citizenship, the quite large amount of money they have to outlay for it is something that they find difficult. I encourage the Minister of State and his staff to look especially at those who have been long-term residents and taxpayers in the State for more than perhaps five or ten years or whatever so that there could be some reduction in fee in respect of them. It might be one way of alleviating this.

Definition (

Part 4

)
12. In this Part, “Act of 1995” means the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995.”.This group of amendments relates to the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995 and the duty of care of occupiers. I am proposing to amend a number of sections of the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995 in line with the Government policy objective of restricting the liability of occupiers. These proposals strike the right balance between ensuring businesses, community groups and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities while also acknowledging the importance of personal responsibility of visitors, recreation users and trespassers. The proposed amendments build on a review paper prepared by my Department in February 2021 and subsequently published. The proposed amendments contain the four key elements, which I will now outline. Amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment that provides the Act of 1995 means the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995. Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 contain the amendments to sections 3 and 4 of the 1995 Act and have the purpose of including in that Act a number of recent court decisions that rebalance the duty of care owed by occupiers due visitors and recreational users. The amendment to section 3 deals with a common duty of care owed by an occupier to a visitor. The amendment to section 4 deals in subsection (4) with a duty owed by an occupier towards a recreational user in respect of a structure provided for use primarily by recreational users. The duty owed to recreational users in respect of a structure is essentially the same as a duty owed to visitors under section 3. Accordingly, I am proposing an amendment on the same lines as the amendment proposed to section 3 in relation to the recent court decisions. The amendment in section 4 seeks to clarify and to limit the circumstances in which a court can impose liability on the occupiers of a premises where persons entered onto the premises for the purpose of committing an offence. The amendment provides that it shall be an exceptional circumstance where a court may determine the occupier shall be liable for a breach of the duty not to act with reckless disregard for the person. The purpose of amendment No. 31 is to insert a new section 5A in the 1995 Act providing for the circumstances in which the occupier may be relieved of liability where the risks are willingly accepted by a visitor or recreational user. Under this new section, it is not necessary for there to be a contract or evidence of other interaction. It is sufficient for the occupier to demonstrate by reference to the words or conduct of a visitor or recreational user that the risk has been willingly accepted. Amendment No. 33 is a consequential amendment to the Long Title. Effectively, through these amendments, we are rebalancing the duty of an occupier and restricting the liability of occupiers under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995.

A common issue we come across in rural areas is a trespasser on somebody's land using it for recreational use. We are talking about walkers, hillwalkers and people walking their dogs and the danger they may experience or cause to other people who are there, including the owner of the property. I would like more detail regarding how this change will impact on that. Insurance is the big issue here. We need to ensure any changes we make will streamline things and make them easier and clearer, because that is one of the problems. There is great confusion about who is liable. The Minister of State mentioned recreational buildings and facilities. I am thinking of facilities used for children playing. We need to find the correct balance that will make insurance more affordable for those running those businesses and the people who hire out other facilities, for example, bouncy castles, to people's homes. There is a major problem in respect of that. Will the Minister of State enlighten us a bit more on that? It is something we can examine in more depth on Report Stage.

I am interested in the area myself. Deputy Kenny makes a good case - indeed, the Minister of State has been proactive in respect of it - in terms of whether the proposed amendments encompass supermarkets and places of retail. Is this the thinking behind the amendments in terms of rebalancing liability or the presumption of liability in respect of slips, falls and those types of issues that can lead to litigation?
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022: Committee Stage	42	One issue that sometimes arises with insurance is that the law is considered to be somewhat complex in this area, so we are attempting to rebalance the current law in order that the occupiers face a decreased risk of liability with regard to those coming onto their property in whatever circumstances they may be. We have sought to do that by lessening the liability but also by bringing clarity to the legislation following a number of court cases on the matter. We are seeking to do this through rebalancing the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors and recreational users. We are talking here mostly about farmland and rural land where people may be going onto the land. It may be a visitor, recreational user or trespasser, and those different categories remain there but we have sought to clarify the type of liability and the circumstances where someone might face liability. What we have sought to do is reflect the common-sense view that the conduct of a high social utility should be assessed less onerously than the conduct of a low social utility. An example would be a recreational user going onto land where the farmer might have facilitated recreational users through a pathway or gateways. In this scenario, the farmer would not face increased liability as a result of facilitating recreational users. We also aim to tighten the law around situations where people may be going onto a premises with the intention of committing an offence. We sought to limit the circumstances in which a court can impose liability in those circumstances. The amendment provides that it shall be an exceptional circumstance where a court may determine that the occupier shall be liable for a breach of duty not to act with reckless disregard for the person in those circumstances. Obviously, it is up to the courts how they interpret and apply the law, but we are strongly of the view that what we have done here is sufficient to protect the occupier of the property while at the same time, ensuring there is no unfair risk to those coming onto the property depending on the different category under which they come onto the land. Regarding supermarkets, based on my own experience as a barrister, most people would take a personal injury action not to do with the natural state of the land but more to do with slips and falls. While the Occupiers' Liability Act may sometimes be referenced in a court case, people tend to succeed in those cases under negligence principles.

In some cases, they are not there for recreation. They come back or send people back later on who carry out crimes such as robberies. A lot of people, particularly in the farming community, are very concerned about that and want reassurance that they have the right to be able to ask somebody what they are doing there, who they are, what their name is, why they are on the owner's property, and for that to stand up. I heard of a case a number of years ago involving a mountainous area adjacent to a beauty spot. People continuously crossed this farmer's land, much of which was very rocky and dangerous. He challenged one couple with children. The couple got very abusive and left. He tried his best. He went to An Garda Síochána and tried to find out who they were and why they were on his land because he had seen them on his property several times but he was unable to find out who they were. While the countryside should be open for people to walk in and enjoy, it should not be abused, and in the case of the small minority who do abuse it, there needs to be some recourse to ensure landowners can come back at it in that respect. Regarding slips and falls in supermarkets or similar premises, I take the point that they are retail outlets. Somebody is going in there to purchase something. They are open to the public and are not properties on which people trespass. The situation is entirely different when trespass is involved. It is an area we need to get to grips with and find solutions.

I understand from the Minister of State's comments that this amendment probably concerns rural scenarios, but slips and falls in supermarkets constitute a real cost to business. Deputy Kenny mentioned people going onto lands looking for trouble rather than a rural idyll. They might even be looking for a fall thinking there might be a windfall at the far side of that depending on how they fall. My understanding is this amendment tries to put paid to that.

The term "offer to settle" is defined as an offer made by a party to a clinical negligence action to settle the claim to which the action relates in accordance with the pre-action protocol.The new section 17A will, when brought into operation, replace the current section 17A which was inserted in the 2004 Act by the Legal Service Regulation Act 2015. The overall effect of the amendment is to allow the pre-action protocol to be developed to address the particular nature of settlements in respect of clinical negligence cases. Preparatory work for the introduction of a pre-action protocol for clinical negligence actions is ongoing in the Department and the Office of the Attorney General. In effect, this amendment allows the pre-action protocols to be developed to address the particular nature of settlements in relation to clinical negligent cases which have been giving difficulty to date.

Effectively, it allows actions to be taken in the District Court which can currently be taken in the Circuit Court and the High Court. It does not take away from the Circuit Court or the High Court and should reduce associated costs for data subjects and those providing defences to claims as well. Effectively, the aim is to improve access to justice and reduce costs by opening the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear data protection actions.

Part 3 governs civil proceedings while Part 4 governs criminal and certain others proceedings such as extradition. Proceeds of crime applications are civil in nature but the drafting of the Part 3, as it stands, raises some possible doubts as to which part they fall under. The intention is that these will be treated as civil for the purposes of the 2020 Act as they would be for other purposes. Addressing this potential ambiguity ensures videolink applications are available and other civil measures in Part 3 apply to these applications.

It provides for unincorporated bodies such as golf clubs and voluntary committees to conduct their meetings remotely if they so wish, notwithstanding any internal rules of the body recurring in person meetings. A similar provision was included in the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, however, this is linked to the pandemic and has expired.

Amendment No. 50 provides for where a court officer or an office of the Courts Service has been designated a centralised court office, it would have the power to carry out the business of the court office of which it has been designated. Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 converse functions of court office staff. Amendment No. 53 provides from transitional provisions, while amendment No. 54 provides immunity from suit against the Courts Service and its staff in respect of anything done or said in good faith in the course or performance of functions.

The latter provides for appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court. This amendment addresses an anomaly identified by the Supreme Court in Irish Life and Permanent plc v.
Dunne, where there was no express provision to allow the High Court, when hearing appeals under section 37 where no oral evidence was given before the Circuit Court, to refer such appeal as a case stated. While the court interpreted the 1936 Act in order that a case stated could be referred under section 37, it would appear prudent to amend the Act to clarify the position.

Most court fees are payable at the point of lodgment of court documents. The prospect of such fees remaining outstanding generally does not arise in such circumstances. However, certain court fees, in particular fees payable on foot of a taxation of costs are collectible after the event, and instances of non-payment have arisen. Amendment No. 61 enables the recovery of unpaid court fees as a civil debt by means of court proceedings.

This amendment is intended to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the Court of Appeal and to reduce the time that is taken up by appeal hearings where there is an abuse of process, the appeal is frivolous or vexatious, is without substance or foundation and which may have been entered for the sole purpose of delay and obstruction. In addition, the following can be referred to a single judge: an appeal against an order or costs; an appeal against an order made pursuant to the slip rule; an appeal against an order made in respect of matters connected with the case management of proceedings; and an appeal against order of the High Court of an interlocutory nature as may be prescribed in the Rules of the Superior Courts. Effectively, to date, three judges of the Court of Appeal have had to sit to hear these types of applications, which, in our view, is completely unnecessary. This amendment will allow for a single judge of the Court of Appeal to hear such applications.

“Amendment of section 36 of Succession Act 1965
33. Section 36 of the Succession Act 1965 is amended—(a) in subsection (4), by the substitution of “until he has satisfied himself, on the basis of an examination of all notices of applications for grants made to the Probate Office and the district probate registries,” for “until he has received from that Office a certificate”, and(b) by the deletion of subsections (5) and (7).”. Amendment No. 68 relates to streamlining the probate process. Perhaps, like the Chairman, there have been a number of solicitors who have been hoping some amendments could be made to streamline the probate service. This amendment is one that will certainly help in such situations. Amendment No. 68 amends section 36 of the Succession Act 1965 to streamline the probate process by allowing a district probate registrar to certify that no other applications have been made in respect of the estate of the deceased person. This is currently done by the courts service personnel and the Dublin Probate Office. This amendment would allow district offices to process and issue the standard grants more efficiently, facilitating a short probate processing time. Amendment No. 79 is an associated amendment to the Long Title.

“Maintenance and champerty not to apply to dispute resolution proceedings
35. The Arbitration Act 2010 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 5:“5A. (1) This section applies to dispute resolution proceedings.(2) The offences and torts of maintenance and champerty do not apply to dispute resolution proceedings.(3) A third-party funding contract that meets the criteria (if any) prescribed under subsection (4) shall not, insofar as it relates to dispute resolution proceedings, be treated as contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal or void.(4) The Minister may, for the purposes of subsection (3), by regulation prescribe criteria, including criteria relating to transparency in relation to funders and recipients, for third-party funding contracts.(5) In this section—‘dispute resolution proceedings’ means:(a) an international commercial arbitration;(b) any proceedings arising out of an international commercial arbitration before a court of competent jurisdiction performing any of the functions provided for in the Model Law;(c) any appeal from a decision of a court referred to in paragraph (b);(d) any mediation or conciliation proceedings arising out of an international commercial arbitration, proceedings or an appeal referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c);‘third-party funding contract’ means a contract or agreement between a party or potential party to dispute resolution proceedings and a third-party funder, for the funding of all or part of the costs of the proceedings in return for a share or other interest in the proceeds or potential proceeds of the dispute resolution proceedings to which the party or potential party may become entitled.”.”.The purpose of amendment No 69 is to amend to the Arbitration Act 2010 by inserting a new section 5A to permit third-party funding in limited circumstances specifically relating to international commercial arbitration. It provides that offences and torts of maintenance and champerty do not apply to dispute resolution proceedings, which are defined as international commercial arbitration and any proceedings arising out of an international commercial arbitration, including any mediation or conciliation proceedings. The new section 5A also includes the power to make regulations prescribing criteria for third-party funding contracts. This amendment will have a positive effect on the international perception of the Irish legal framework by removing any doubts regarding the ability to enforce arbitration awards in the State. While the amendment provides for a limited liberalisation of third-party funding, next year my Department will commence a broader policy review on the Law Reform Commission position paper on the matter, which will be published in the coming months. Amendment No. 80 is the associated amendment to the Long Title.

36. Schedule 1 to the Garda Síochána (Functions and Operational Areas) Act 2022 is amended, in column (5) opposite mention of reference number 9, in the amendment of section 27B(15) of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, by the substitution of “The chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána division shall cause to be kept a register of all lottery permits” for “The chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána division shall cause to be kept a register of all gaming permits”.”.This amendment corrects a typo in the Garda Síochána (Functions and Operational Areas) Act 2022, and substitutes the reference to "lottery permits" with the phrase "gaming permits". Amendment No. 81 amends the Long Title to reflect the inclusion of the provision. The issue was caused by the change of Garda districts into divisions.
