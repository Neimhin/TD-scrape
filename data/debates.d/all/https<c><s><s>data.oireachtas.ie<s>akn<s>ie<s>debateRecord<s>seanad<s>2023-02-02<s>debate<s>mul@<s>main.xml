            <from>Senator John McGahon<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">I raise this matter this morning after meeting Cara McAdam, who is a science teacher in De La Salle College, Dundalk, a couple of weeks ago. She showed me the science laboratory and the rest of the college. There are four laboratories, one of which is in a new part of the building. Two are in a building dating from 1978 while one of the laboratories was built in 1998. I am sure the Minister of State can agree that using science laboratories built in the 1970s and the late 1990s in 2023 is not acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> There have been no upgrades to the laboratories during that time. They are very dated and in many regards are not fit for purpose. There is no safe working gas supply and no use of a fume cupboard in the chemistry laboratory. The laboratory built in 1998 is in a building with a chronic damp and mould problem. There is frequent flooding and infestations. There are about 700 pupils in the school, nearly all of whom are taking science. I saw for myself that the fume cupboard in the 1998 laboratory is positioned on the wall leading into the centre of the building, which is a violation of all health and safety standards. Fume cupboards should be on the edge of a building so that if there is an explosion, it goes outside rather than into the building. This clear violation of health and safety standards goes back to 1998. </p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The science laboratories are hugely outdated. We are encouraging many students at second level to look towards careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and science is a really important part of that. The students taking science in De La Salle College, Dundalk, are simply not getting bang for their buck. They are not getting the full proper science experience because their teachers are unable to teach them in adequate classrooms. </p>
            <p eId="para_20"> I accept that this school will have to apply for the summer works scheme, particularly in category 5, which is funding for science laboratories, and I know this process has started. Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to give me a bit more clarity on when that summer works scheme will open, when the category 5 scheme will open and when applications can be submitted. </p>
            <p eId="para_21"> This is a really good example of trying to modernise our classrooms across the country. It is really not fair that students are trying to learn in classrooms that are more than 40 years old. It is not fair that teachers trying to bring their students along and teach them in an important manner have to work in these conditions. </p>
            <p eId="para_22"> My reason for raising this matter on the floor of the House is because in 2023, students and teachers should not be operating out of classrooms that are 40 years old. Teachers should not have to operate in such a situation and the nearly 700 students taking science in De La Salle College, Dundalk, should not have to sit in classrooms with damp and mould infestations with equipment that does not work and where health and safety requirements are not met. </p>
            <p eId="para_23">I accept that the funding measures will be through category 5, so I am very keen to hear a bit more detail about that, including how the school will be able to apply for that funding and how we can get these four science laboratories upgraded as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (Deputy Niall Collins)<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_24">I thank Senator McGahon for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position in relation to De La Salle College, Dundalk, County Louth, on behalf of Minister for Education, Deputy Foley. De La Salle College is an all-boys school under the patronage of the Le Chéile Schools Trust. The enrolment at the school in September 2022 was 704 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> With regard to meeting the current and future accommodation needs of De La Salle College, the school was approved funding under the Department of Education's additional school accommodation scheme in 2018. This project will deliver two mainstream classrooms, a design and communications graphics room and two classrooms for students with special education needs. This project has been devolved to the school authority for delivery and is currently at stage 2A.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> In September 2022 the Department also approved interim accommodation to facilitate the opening of a class for students with special educational needs from September 2023. A project to deliver this modular accommodation is under way in cognisance of the importance of urgently facilitating the new special class at the school. The purpose of the additional school accommodation scheme is to ensure essential teaching spaces and accommodation for students with special educational needs are available to cater for pupils enrolled each year where the need cannot be met by the school's existing accommodation. At post-primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for significantly increasing enrolments due to demographic pressures or to provide accommodation for special classes and where all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for teaching purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately €4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025. There will be a rolling five-year funding envelope which will be updated annually for the period 2026 to 2030 within the Government's overall national development plan, NDP, funding envelope of €136 billion in Exchequer capital that will facilitate building a modern and sustainable school infrastructure. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high-quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities throughout Ireland. The strengthened focus on the refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands and will include a deep energy retrofit programme in support of our 2030 and 2050 climate action goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> I advise the Senator that updates in relation to all school building projects are provided on the Department's website and this is updated regularly.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I thank the Minister of State. As I said, this is just the start of the process of this campaign and the goal of getting these science laboratories updated. As the Minister of State has acknowledged and as I have pointed out, the way we will do this is through the summer works scheme through category 5, which is funding for science laboratories. Obviously, there will be a number of schools trying to apply for that. I would hope that, given the really severe condition of these school laboratories, which have not been updated since the 1970s and 1998, when the application does come from the De La Salle secondary school in Dundalk, the Minister and the Department would be able to look upon it favourably and in the context of the situation that nearly all of the 700 students in the school are taking science and they need the full science experience that students get at other schools in Dundalk.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I thank the Senator for giving the opportunity to outline to the House the position in relation to De La Salle College in Dundalk. The refurbishment of science laboratories as proposed by De La Salle College is appropriate to the Department of Education's summer works scheme. The summer works scheme is the funding mechanism for dealing with the more significant improvement works that are usually carried out during school holiday periods to minimise disruption to the operation of schools. The summer works scheme operates on a multi-annual basis, and at this stage it is envisaged the summer works scheme will next be opened for new applications later in 2023 for the delivery of projects on a phased basis from 2024 onwards. Schools will be notified of the details of the summer works scheme in due course and it will be open to the school to make an application at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Cathaoirleach. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber today. As the Cathaoirleach has said, a number of Members have raised this issue, and Senator Buttimer has indeed been at the forefront on the issues around cystic fibrosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I am here for an update from the Minister of State. He will be aware that Cystic Fibrosis Ireland had called for a health technology assessment to be completed by the end of January. We are now into February. I submitted this Commencement matter at the end of January to get an update. There are 35 children and their families awaiting news. They had been denied the drug Kaftrio. I have been contacted by a former senior psychologist at the adult unit for cystic fibrosis in St. Vincent's University Hospital. She outlined to me the real psychological challenges for people when they are dealing with a long-term condition such as cystic fibrosis. We in Ireland have a particular propensity for cystic fibrosis. There is no cure and people are reliant on these drugs. It is immoral not to ensure every person who needs the drug can get access to it. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response. I would like to hear that the HSE had been in contact with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and some confirmation that the health technology assessment is either completed or nearing completion. The families were disappointed to hear it needed to go through this step, albeit a step in the right direction.</p>

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. I thank Senator O'Reilly for raising this issue. Cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease for patients and their families. With Ireland having one of highest <i>per capita</i> rates of cystic fibrosis in the world, many of us will have been affected by the sadness it can cause for families. Access to effective treatments offers hope to those suffering from this disease, and the Minister aims to make this possible for every patient who needs it.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Kaftrio has been a life-changing drug for cystic fibrosis sufferers. Access to drugs like this was what we expected when the HSE signed its agreement with the drug's manufacturer, Vertex, in 2017. That deal stipulated that our patients would have access to Vertex's whole portfolio of cystic fibrosis drugs for a capped yearly cost. We made a ten-year commitment which has already seen us pay hundreds of millions of euro to Vertex. We entered this agreement in good faith, expecting that as new licences were approved for their medicines, the HSE would receive access at no additional cost. This had been the case previously when new indications were licensed. The agreement was amended in 2019 and 2020 to include these patient groups at no additional cost. However, for this particular subtype affecting a small group of children, Vertex is requesting additional funds to provide access. The HSE has statutory responsibility for the community drug schemes. It has structures in place to ensure our health services are available to provide the right care sustainably.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Given the substantial budgetary impact of the additional funds sought by Vertex, it must complete the pricing and reimbursement process that is required in respect of all other medicines. This requires the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE to complete a health technology assessment, HTA, of Kaftrio for this patient group. Until recently, Vertex did not engage with this process. Following extensive efforts from the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit, CPU, Vertex supplied its HTA dossier to the NCPE in January 2023. The NCPE has agreed to treat this HTA as a priority. The Minister is pushing to have the HTA completed as soon as possible. In the meantime, the HSE's CPU continues its open dialogue with Vertex and met its representatives on a couple of occasions in January.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> The Government is committed to providing access to innovative new medicines for Irish patients. Budgets 2021 and 2022 saw €80 million of funding dedicated to new medicines and 112 new medicines, or expanded uses of existing medicines, 34 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases, were provided since 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> I thank Cystic Fibrosis Ireland for its efforts in bringing attention to this situation. It provided valuable insight to the Minister during the meeting late last year. The voices of the parents of these children have also been heard and the Minister fully appreciates their concern. He and I are hopeful that this matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion for everyone involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I will not get into a long discussion on the stranglehold that pharma companies have when it comes to providing treatment. As the Minister of State indicated, a huge amount of money was given to Vertex. I am disappointed that we have no update on the HTA. I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister and ask him to, as soon as possible, give me a date by which he thinks it will be completed. Cystic Fibrosis Ireland wanted this done by the end of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> We have a new group in Leinster House of Senators and Deputies who are interested in rare diseases. It can be incredibly difficult to advocate for yourself when you have a rare illness. It is really important that we have this group in order that we can advocated more effectively on people's behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">We fully appreciate the severity of cystic fibrosis and acknowledge the fears and frustrations of the families affected by this situation. The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions as given to it in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. This requires that the HSE ensures that medicines are reimbursed in a cost-effective manner. The HSE is making every effort to fulfil its responsibility. Following extensive efforts by the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit we are now seeing progress with this situation. The Minister, the clinical community and, most importantly, the families affected are all eager to see progress towards making this drug available to these children. I will certainly convey the Senator's concerns and comments to the Minister directly.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">l raise an issue in respect of which Senator Ahearn campaigned all through last year in order to make sure that the product in question was on the funding list. It is now on the funding list but it may as well not be. The provision is completely impotent. I refer to the alleged reimbursement for Cariban. This product is for women who suffer severe illness and vomiting during pregnancy. The condition for its reimbursement under the scheme is that it must be prescribed by a consultant. However, the reimbursement is subject to the drug payment scheme meaning that the person for whom it is prescribed must pay the first €80. A woman may only see a consultant when she is well advanced in the first trimester, if not at the very end going into the second trimester, so she has to fund the medicine for the first 12 weeks. Even when a person qualifies for the scheme, there is no retrospective reimbursement.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> When this matter was raised in the Dáil, the response was from the Minister for Health - I note that the Minister of State here is not in that Department, which is a bit of a disappointment but which is no reflection on him personally - was to implore the drug companies to apply for the licence. However, the drug companies and practitioners are operating lawfully because we have an exempt medicinal product list. The point of that is that it is not necessary to apply for a licence or authorisation but if a consultant underwrites it, and, in other words, takes the risk away from the State in the prescribing of this matter, then where the consultant takes on the risk and carries the legal burden then it will be all right.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> Rather than Ministers standing up and calling on the drug companies to apply for this and ensure that it is on the list, it would be better to reappraise the exempt list and assess whether it is suitable. Women can be sick all the time for the duration of the nine months of their pregnancies. The State purports to provide them with financial support but, in actual fact, it does not do so; it provides them with the very minimum. In that context, they might get a box and a half of Cariban capsules every four weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I will not rehearse what Senator Seery Kearney said, but I echo both every single word and the passion with which she spoke. I have been raising this matter since April 2021. In other words, for almost two years. It seems that either no one is listening or that people are moving to some degree but are doing so while kicking and screaming. We are getting to the point where Hyperemesis Ireland is incredibly frustrated. Individuals such as Sabrina Hill have to go on Instagram and talk bravely about their experiences of going through this debilitating condition. It seems as though no one in a position of power cares. We talk about how healthcare, particularly maternity care, for women is free. It is not free for all women. It is not free for women who go through this condition, and that is not fair. They look at countries such as Spain, where Cariban is incredibly cheap to buy, or the UK, where it is free to get. Cariban is neither cheap nor free in Ireland. The most frustrating thing is that a consultant has to sign off on it. I know about this as a result of my wife's experience. We had a baby just before Christmas. If you go through the public system, as we did, you do not see a consultant until well into the second trimester. As as result, people who cannot afford this drug cannot see a consultant early in their pregnancy would have to pay for the drug themselves for the first 12 to 14 weeks. The cost is extraordinary. What is it with the Department of Health that it seems to be putting obstacles in the way of women right across the country in the context of their receiving the right and proper healthcare they deserve when they go through pregnancy?</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I am here on behalf of the Minister for Health. I thank Senators Seery Kearney and Ahearn for raising this matter and appreciate that it will be a concern for many women in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that affects some women and that must be diagnosed and treated appropriately. The Government is keen to ensure that anyone experiencing this condition receives the support they need. As part of budget 2023, the Minister for Health announced €32.2 million in funding for women's health this year. That includes dedicated funding for Cariban, a medicine used to treat hyperemesis gravidarum. As of January, this medicine is now available to those women who need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> Unfortunately, reaching this point has not been straightforward. Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, only medicines that are licensed and have marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency or Health Products Regulatory Authority can be added to the HSE's formal reimbursement list. Cariban is not licensed and therefore cannot be added to the reimbursement list. It is instead classed as an exempt medicinal product. There are three medicines containing doxylamine or pyridoxine that are licensed in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">These are listed in the reply. Two of them are gastro-resistant tablets and one is modified-release hard capsules. To date, the market authorisation holder of Xonvea has not progressed the pricing and reimbursement application further with the HSE. The market authorisation holders for Exeltis and Navalem have not submitted pricing and reimbursement applications to the HSE. Therefore, to address the unmet needs of patients with hyperemesis gravidarum, the HSE's medicines management programme was asked to review the evidence available on the unlicensed exempt medicinal product Cariban, and to make a recommendation on the appropriateness and feasibility of an exceptional patient-specific process for access to the product.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Following the recommendations of the medicines management programme, an exceptional arrangement has been put in place to support the reimbursement of Cariban. Cariban is now available under the community drug schemes on an individual patient basis for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy where consultant obstetrician-initiated. While the initial prescription for Cariban must be issued by a consultant, further prescriptions can be issued by the patient's GP. Consultant initiation is the case for all unlicensed exempt medicinal products under the community drugs schemes. The HSE advise that where a drug is not licensed, the expertise of a specialist in the relevant field is necessary to ensure safe usage. However, if a licensed product was approved for reimbursement this arrangement could then be reviewed or revised. The HSE therefore encourages clinicians, along with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Clinical Programme for Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and other healthcare professionals to encourage the market authorisation holders of the available licensed medicinal products to progress with the formal pricing and reimbursement process in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Minister of State. With due respect, putting the onus on drug companies to make the application when they are part of a for-profit industry - and let us be very clear about what it is - is absolutely farcical. It is not a patient-led response nor is it a citizens-of-the-Republic-led response. The fact is that what we are about is deferring the risk and the legal burden onto a practitioner or a consultant. The person who pays the cost in the middle of that is a woman who either does not get her prescription, does not get her funding, or may in fact be hospitalised at a cost to the State. The cost includes the hospitalisation, the woman's health, the bed that is unnecessarily taken up, and a woman on a drip in a hospital, as some of the patients who need treatment have told me. To be quite honest, the whole arrangement of an exempt list and our funding relationship with that needs to be reviewed and needs to be patient-centred.</p>

There are women listening to the debate today to hear what answer is going to be given from the Department. Basically, the response today is a load of rubbish. How many Ministers are there in the Department of Health? People will ask me today why no Minister from the Department of Health was here. Of course, it is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Collins. He is a great Minister of State in his Department. How many Ministers do we need in the Department of Health for one of them to come here and answer a question on why women cannot receive the same treatment? What they tell me is that if this was a men's condition, one could be damned sure that the issue would be resolved. Why can women not receive the same treatment and respect, at least in this Chamber, for Ministers from the Department of Health to come here and answer genuine questions from people who are actually in Government with them?</p>

            <p eId="para_53">On behalf of the Minister for Health, I thank the Senators for raising this important matter today. Progressing women's health is a priority for this Government. A strong commitment to promoting women's health was made in the programme for Government. We are fully committed to the development and improvement of women's health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole lifecycle. The funding of €32.2 million for the women's health budget in 2023 will help continue making progress in the area for the coming year. This includes the dedicated funding for Cariban. The Minister for Health is pleased that this treatment is now available to those women who need it, and hopes it will make a meaningful difference to their well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The Minister understands the frustration that exists around the fact that the medicine is only accessible via a consultant prescription in the first instance. This is because Cariban is an unlicensed exempt medicinal product, and therefore the expertise of a specialist in the field is necessary to ensure safe usage. The HSE's managed access protocols for Cariban lay out appropriate clinical protocols that must be followed to ensure safe usage.

            <p eId="para_56">I congratulate the Minister of State on her elevation to office.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> In 2019, the Houses of the Oireachtas passed the usual Finance Act, allowing for regulations of taxation, stamp duties and duties relating to excise. Included in the Bill was section 6, on benefit-in-kind emissions-based calculations, which gave effect to a measure included in that year's budget relating to benefit-in-kind tax on employers providing vehicles. The effect of the measure is as follows. From 1 January 2023, a new charging regime for employer-provided cars will take effect, and will be based on kilometres travelled with the CO2 emissions levels of the car. Also, the rate of benefit-in-kind tax on employer-provided vans will increase from 5% to 8% of the original market value of the van from 1 January 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> With a commencement date of four years off, I am sure it seemed a long way down the road, but here we are now and the tax hike signed into law prior to Covid is hitting people all over the country during a period of general global inflation and the Irish cost-of-living crisis. Average employees will see a reduction in their pay packet of approximately €300 per month, according to the chief executive of the Kildare Chamber of Commerce. One company driver, Ivan O'Sullivan, a medical representative who covers Northern Ireland and parts of Dublin and Leinster, drives hundreds of kilometres every day. He told RTÉ that his benefit-in-kind has trebled. "It is a huge hit for me financially. It is hundreds of euros a month, thousands a year", he said. Indeed, for many people who use a company car in lieu of a private vehicle, this four-year-old tax hike will all but wipe out any advantages received in this year's budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> We have about 150,000 company cars in this country and many of these workers have no choice but to drive them. They have been penalised for not having a private automobile - a state of affairs which any critical-thinking climate advocate would realise is absurd. Of course, the reverse logic when it comes to CO2 reductions does not end there. The formula used to calculate the tax, based on kilometres travelled, results in the benefit-in-kind charge on a work vehicle actually dropping at higher mileage due to the thinking that the greater the distance travelled for business, the more the car benefits the company rather than its employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> The Vehicle Leasing Association of Ireland has warned that it may be contrary to the climate action plan by making businesses move away from company cars to look at adopting an allowance method whereby employees could drive their own high-polluting second-hand cars rather than avail of the company's comparatively new more energy-efficient models. Vehicle leasing companies are reporting that some workers are seeking to hand back their company cars or buy them out so that they can use them as private cars and claim mileage instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">While many companies will transition to an electric fleet over time, at the moment, there is a shortage of electric and hybrid vehicles due to supply chain difficulties and electric vehicle, EV, battery technology. The charging infrastructure is not sufficiently advanced to make such vehicles a viable alternative for many workers. It is an absolute disaster between extra fuel costs and all the other costs that are part of everyday life. It is a real blow for anybody who has a company car.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> What is the plan? Are we keeping this reverse logic tax hike, which was put in place four years ago when we had no idea of the state we were going to be in? Are we at least going to introduce some measure to cushion the blow for those users of company cars?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill)<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_63">I thank Senator Keogan for raising this issue. Of course, she is right. When this was introduced in 2019, it was part of the climate action plan and part of a climate focus on making a transition and bringing the benefit-in-kind, BIK, in line with the other vehicle taxes, namely, vehicle registration tax, VRT, and motor tax which, of course, are carbon-based. The Senator is also correct in identifying that there was a long lead-in time to try to allow for fleet planning. However, just because the Finance Bill said there is a long lead-in time it does not always mean that people have the opportunity to be fully aware of that or fully able to adapt to it, particularly during a pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The Senator is also right in stating that there was no possible way of foreseeing in 2019 the energy price crisis we have or the inflationary crisis we had post pandemic. The situation is very complex. I genuinely recognise that and that the timing of this, albeit that it was planned three or four years ago, is quite difficult. I will set out some of the rationale behind the decision-making originally.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> As the Senator will be aware, and she has supported it on many occasions, Government policy is very firmly focused on the environmental rationale around company car taxation. As I said, the emissions-based approach has already been adopted for VRT and motor tax. The approach is being extended to company cars as per the 2021 climate action plan. A CO2-based BIK for company cars was legislated for three years ago, obviously, with the commencement date of 1 January 2023. From the beginning of this year, the amount taxable as BIK was determined as the car's original market value and the annual business kilometres driven, as highlighted by the Senator. The lead-in time between the legislation and that actually being applied was to send that advance signal to industry to adapt to this new system as typical lease renewal periods are approximately three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> Until the changes brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland's vehicle BIK regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 basis to it. This was despite the fact that the latter had been legislated for in 2008 but not implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> In some instances, as the Senator said, this new regime will provide for higher BIK rates, for example, with regard to above-average emissions and high-mileage cars. It should be noted, though, that to offset this, the taxable rates remain largely the same in the lower to mid-mileage ranges for the average lower-emission car. In addition, EVs benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9% to 22.5%, depending on mileage. Vehicles that run on fossil fuels are subject to higher BIK rates up to 37.5%. As we are aware, this new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges is designed to incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> Under the new regime, the number of mileage bands has reduced from five to four. There were some arguments around the mileage bands in the new BIK structure, as though they were incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions, which appears to be a contradiction. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that, as the Senator said, the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than to the employee and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee. Mileage bands also ensure that cars that are more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> Better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the number of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK system. That point is accepted across the board. The particular point the Senator raised was about the timing of its introduction at this moment and how that is impacting people having regard to the external circumstances. I understand and have a lot of sympathy for that. However, the purpose and rational was to bring the taxation around company cars into line with our own other taxation measures on a carbon basis and also with those right across Europe, which also have carbon-based BIK ratings.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I thank the Minister of State very much. I appreciate the comprehensive answer. The issue was the lead-in period, however, which began four years ago. It was not on the radar of many companies. I only became aware of it around December when a number of people contacted me to tell me how much they were going to be out of pocket.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Do I have to look at other legislation or other budgetary measures the Government has delayed over a period of time that have serious consequences for individuals, particularly companies and employees within those companies? This has hit the employees quite hard. I am a little disappointed that there are no plans to review this in the context of the forthcoming budget. Is there anything that can be done in the budget to make matters easier? Is this something the Minister of State might look at?</p>

            <p eId="para_72">I thank the Senator. I recognise that when something was legislated for in the Finance Act four years ago, it can seem a bit remote. The purpose of it was to enable fleet planning by companies, not by employees. The latter would not perhaps have had the same familiarity with the provisions of the Finance Act as we might have understood their employers to have, particularly when it came to renewing leases. These are conversations that companies that are engaged in ongoing lease renewals should be having with suppliers. There is a disconnect between the employee who is actually paying this now and the fleet planning we might have hoped for and anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> One of the aspects to look at is that budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end in 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. Therefore, the relief is being phased down incrementally from €50,000 in 2022 to €10,000 in 2025. That is to try to encourage early adaptation towards EVs by fleet planners, as opposed to employees, and to try to do that in the most expeditious way possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">The general scheme of the registration of short-term tourist letting Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny at the moment. In his opening statement on 25 January, the principal officer at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_78">As the committee is aware, large numbers of properties have been withdrawn from the long-term rental market in recent years for use as more lucrative short-term lettings, in particular in larger urban centres where housing demand and need is most acute. This trend, which has been largely facilitated by online platforms, has had a negative impact on the supply and availability of long-term rental accommodation in the private rental sector and in driving up rents.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">That is true. In his opening statement, the principal officer from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media stated, "The Government’s housing policy, Housing for All, includes the objective of making more efficient use of existing housing." That is also true. Housing is at a premium and the majority of people have no issue with the registration of self-catering accommodation and short-term letting. At a meeting in Buswells Hotel yesterday, the Irish Self Catering Federation highlighted a problem in this regard. I have also met a number of representatives from Connemara and have spoken to people in County Galway on this issue. Many small operators may have a converted old outhouse in the back or a garage that was converted for short-term letting. They may even be letting rooms in their own homes. Some holiday homes are used for two or three weeks by the owners but are also let on a short-term basis for six months. They have no problem with registering; the issue arises when they need to get planning permission, leading to problems with costs and the possibility of not being granted permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The motive behind this is to try to increase the supply of long-term letting with which I agree. However, the consequence is that people will just shut down. They will no longer let their properties and rooms. We will not have the long-term lets or the short-term lets. Those short-term lets are very important to the economy of places like north Connemara and elsewhere. It is also important to the owners of those properties. It is not that they will make a fortune, but they will make a few thousand euro after tax. It is important for that family. We need a debate on the matter of the Bill. I agree with the principle of what it is trying to achieve but there is considerable concern in certain areas about its consequences and that it will not achieve what it hopes and needs to achieve.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">The first thing I was going to do was to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for having the moment of silence for peace yesterday. I very much appreciated that. All the schoolchildren from Scoil Bhríde Athgarvan appreciated that you came down and gave so much time to them at our St. Brigid's cross-making workshop. I thank everybody from across the House who came. It was wonderful to have the buzz of children showing parliamentarians and staff how to make those crosses. It was a very special day for them as, of course, it was for everybody across the county of Kildare and throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I also thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for the excellent presentation last night and the film it put together about the creativity of Irish women across the world. It was wonderful to have the President of the European Court of Human Rights, Síofra O'Leary, and Professor Aoife Nolan who is now the president of the European Committee of Social Rights. It is great to have two such wonderful women leading the way in human rights and democracy across Europe. Well done to all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> Of course, there will be continued activities leading up to and including the bank holiday this weekend, which will lead us to the Brigid 1500 event next year. It is a really good time. We need moments of reflection like those in our lives when we can celebrate St. Brigid and her legacy. When I was growing up in Kildare, I always thought she was a very cool saint. When we see everything she stands for now, that is absolutely the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> We often hear of and pressures on our hospitals across the country and it is right to call attention to that. It is also important to highlight when things go right. Over the weekend, unfortunately a family member of mine had to go to the emergency department and was admitted to Naas hospital. Although I was not there, I must say that the care and support given was incredible. It was second to none. There were no long delays. It might have just been a question of luck. I thank the staff at Naas hospital and other hospitals who give everything they have to ensure that all those coming through their doors are treated with dignity, respect and the care they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> I wish to mention schoolbooks. We are very lucky to have excellent independent bookshops such as Farrell &amp; Nephew in Newbridge and Woodbine books in Kilcullen. There are smaller shops which sell schoolbooks such as Natasha's in Rathangan. There is a lack of clarity about the free schoolbooks scheme to be introduced in September. It is vital that these independent bookshops and other shops have the opportunity to supply these schoolbooks, which provides a lifeline to keep them open. We need to send the message from here that that is really important to our local economy and our local shops.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I want to raise two issues that have been given some coverage this week. The first is the incident at the Ashtown migrant camp. This morning, I am not going to getting into who saw that or who said what, and I think that debate has played out on Twitter between individual journalists, and Senator Mullen addressed it here yesterday. The evidence or lack thereof is there for anyone with eyes to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> A broader point coming out of all of this is why on earth we are only hearing about this encampment now. Ashtown is in Dublin, be it Dublin 15 or Dublin 7, so we have had at least one shanty tent encampment in our capital city for over a year. This tells us one of two things. Either the politicians in these Houses who serve that area did not know it was there, in which case it is a damning indictment of just how out of touch they are with their constituents, or they did know and did not do anything about it, which is equally damning as it shows how little care they have for their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I am in this House three days a week and I can tell the Leader that I still know if there is a peep out of a mouse in Duleek or any part of east Meath, and it is similar in Navan when it comes to Councillor Alan Lawes. I urge the public to look very closely at which of their politicians have their ears on the ground, listening to the people and amplifying their voices, and which ones are happy to sit in their ideological ivory towers with their own agendas.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Speaking of agendas, the St. Patrick's Festival announcement went a bit heavy-handed with the progressivism, did it not? The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, had the good sense to wear some green, as did a handful of others, but front and centre were, bizarrely, women and girls in what appeared to be Spanish-style flamenco dresses. I spotted two cowboys, some girls in an odd sort of beetle costume like something out of a Marvel movie and, of course, the ever-present men in women's faces, who apparently must be included in every public display lest the Government risk the ire of terminally online woke Twitter addicts.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> It was more than a questionable decision, many feel, to place a young girl of about eight years of age, 3 ft away from a man's crotch bulging out of tiny lace tights and underwear, and to take photos showing that, and then say, “Yip, that is what we want to represent Ireland internationally”, and run with it. I find myself agreeing with many citizens online who voiced the opinion that maybe, instead of the fetishistic exposure at our St. Patrick's Day parade, we just have St. Patrick. It worked very well for the past 400 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I would like to discuss the recently launched Youth Arts Now report. Research into youth arts is, unfortunately, lacking in comparison with other fields. I would, therefore, like to begin by acknowledging the hard work and dedication of John O'Brien and those who contributed to this report, including the Arts Council and the folks in Waterford. We have a long, noble and vibrant artistic history in Ireland. Indeed, I have often spoken of how, in my teenage years, I was politicised by our folk music and songs, some of which were the first great literary expression of the Irish people through the English language. However, despite our proud artistic history, youth art is, as recently noted in the Youth Arts Now report, facing several fundamental barriers to success, in particular a lack of a consistent and centralised source of funding to the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Varying funding from county to county means that young people find themselves in a postcode lottery, and the lack of funding has also meant that youth arts has come to rely on volunteers. These dedicated individuals give their time, their energy, their imagination and their expertise for very little financial reward or gain. We are, therefore, relying on the professional status and pay of those working in the sector to deliver on this. Young people deserve the inspiration and the tools to forge their own creative and cultural paths, and it is vital that we consider the recommendation of this Youth Arts Now report and assess how best to support it. I call for a debate on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> More broadly, I believe Ireland is excessively restrictive in terms of creating cultural activity. Where do I start? We have a litigious culture that stops events taking place, infrastructure that is in places non-existent, a lack of scale for people to organise events, and gatekeeping of bigger venues. Then there are the physically constrained Victorian spaces that were never designed for everyone and were designed primarily for the middle classes at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> Nowhere is this more restrictive and obvious at the moment than in the area of public art. Despite the undoubted artistic merit of street art and events, the number of spaces where street artists can legally paint remains few and far between. The closure of the Bernard Shaw and the demolition of the Tivoli Theatre have all but decimated the number of easily accessible spaces where young artists can practise their public art. The position is equally dire when it comes to private spaces, with planning law stopping that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> I know members of SUBSET are here in Leinster House today and that a Bill will be launched in the Dáil on this issue around planning legislation. It cannot happen soon enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I want to start by congratulating those involved with the launch of Dublin Communities Against Racism over the weekend, including my good friend and colleague, Senator Eileen Flynn. I found the recent eruption of racist anti-refugee protests to be deeply disturbing, and many of the leaders of these protests are spreading misinformation that plays on the fears and prejudices of ordinary people. It is commendable that in the wake of these protests, community members in places like Finglas and East Wall have banded together and formed local anti-racist groups to demonstrate that their communities are supportive and welcoming places, and are not represented by the far-right fringe.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> These anti-refugee protests outside places where refugee children are staying are not an example of normal democratic protests. They represent the intimidation of vulnerable people that this State has a duty of care towards. The recent attack on a homeless encampment illustrates the clear and present danger posed by violent racists. There were public threats seen by thousands of people on social media before the attack, so why did the Garda fail to take action to prevent it? That is the question I would like to ask. This is very concerning. Measures need to be taken to safeguard those at risk. We must be proactive about dispelling the lies and distortion that the far right uses to organise. Community leaders in relevant areas need to be liaised with so they can build support in their community for the new arrivals and can tackle any unfounded fears or rumours they encounter.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The arrival of refugees into communities, particularly ones which experience significant neglect, can inspire anxiety about additional strains on public services, which is understandable. The communities that are hosting additional numbers of refugees need to be provided with adequate resources. On an important point, the Government must also ensure that exclusive, wealthy areas do their fair share as well. Perceptions that deprived communities must house refugee populations when affluent ones do not, fuel this far-right narrative of grievance and paranoia. I support the proposal mooted by Councillor Dermot Lacey to use the vacant Jury’s Hotel in Ballsbridge to house refugees. It makes practical sense and would send a message that all of us have a role to play in making sure Ireland is welcoming to refugees fleeing violence, deprivation and war.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Ireland is a country that resisted and defeated the racism and cruelty of colonialism. It is a country that has exported its population to all corners of the globe. To be Irish and racist is irrational but, unfortunately, it is increasingly prevalent. Those of us in the anti-racist majority need to be clear that we will not stand by and allow refugees to be used as scapegoats. Refugees are welcome in our communities and racists are not.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">I want to raise a couple of matters with the Deputy Leader. The first is to seek a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on the circular economy Bill which he has brought before these Houses. The reason I ask for such a debate is the unacceptable dumping that continues to blight our countryside, roads and towns and villages. Of course, great credit must go to all those involved in Tidy Towns associations and community groups that carry out such great work in all of our communities, and we see them every day and weekend on our roads and in the countryside. However, driving into Leinster House today and talking to so many people over the last number of weeks, the simple fact is that our roadsides are dumping grounds, and this problem is as bad as I and many other people have ever seen it.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Every road, woodland, street and country area seems to be considered a dumping ground for those who have no consideration for the people living there. It is unsightly. This problem is worse than I have ever seen it.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> We talk about this beautiful green land we have, yet roadsides are covered in rubbish. There is no other way of putting it. I introduced a Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. Senator Malcolm Byrne introduced a similar Bill to encourage the use of CCTV to identify the perpetrators. Those Bills were accepted by the Government. The Minister thanked us both for our work on them, but, unfortunately, the problem is getting worse. Many people have raised this matter with me in the recent weeks. We need an urgent debate on this. The national spring clean initiative is on the way. A number of people in my community have been out and about in the past couple of weeks. They contacted me because they have found the problem to be as bad as ever. If a debate can be organised, it would be greatly appreciated. We need a debate on this matter as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I also wish to raise the issue of school places in south Kildare. Yesterday I received a call from parents in the area whose 12-year-old child has still not got a school place. I continue to receive many such calls on a weekly basis. Colleagues in this House and the Lower House also receive such calls. The parents in question are worried because their 12-year-old does not yet have a school place. All her friends have places. That is the problem. She is looking around and knows the school she wants to go to but, unfortunately, she cannot get into that school, which all her friends will be going to. Her parents were worried about her mental health. They are worried about where she is going to go. This is what is happening to so many families in south Kildare. I would appreciate it if we could contact the Minister for Education again. I have contacted her several times, as have colleagues in this House. I appreciate that solutions are on the way. I know that new schools and extensions are being built, but the problem is that this child needs a place for September next. There is a need for someone to sit down with the public representatives. I would appreciate if the Deputy Leader could contact the Minister in respect of this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I join Senator Black in commenting on the increase in the number of far-right anti-immigration protests across the city. We have seen lots of them in Ballyfermot and Drimnagh in the constituency of Dublin South-Central. Thankfully, and really encouragingly, local groups are coming together and hold protests against the far right. We have the Drimnagh For All and Ballyfermot for All groups. Since these groups were set up, the number of far-right protests in our area has decreased. The last protest the far right tried to organise was dampened down. If communities are considering joining groups such as those to which I refer, they should know that what they do works. When communities come together and make a statement that they are taking a certain stance and will not accept racism, people hear that and follow suit. When they see community leaders taking a certain stance, it is very impactful. We need to keep talking about, keep myth busting and keep putting out information explaining to people regarding why people are seeking refuge and why conflating the issues is not the right thing to do. People coming here are not getting houses from people who are on waiting lists. Many refugees coming to this country are in emergency-style accommodation all over the country and you are not comparing like with like. There is so much feeding of our fears. When these groups come together to put a stop to that, however, it really works.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> We need to look at the international protection process and the timeframes involved. It is really unfair that people seeking international protection have to wait so long. Many of them have deportation orders hanging over their heads. That is institutional bullying. It is horrendous when you see families that are not really living their lives because they have deportation orders over them. We need to look at systems to get people working and integrated, and, ultimately, to maintain our stance that we are against racism.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I will address the recent nursing home fees scandal and the withdrawal of disability payments to 12,000 people. I have the experience, as a parent and carer, of the day-to-day struggle to accessing citizenship in this Republic. It is very difficult. We are an outlier in European terms. This country is one of the worst places in the EU in which to have a disability or to be elderly, frail or vulnerable. I do not stand back from using those words. I have had the experience of lifting my adult son in the morning and looking after his intimate care needs. These are very intimate moments. It is quality time. We are trying to get him dressed and out of the house - to think there are able-bodied and well-educated people in positions of power who would conspire to suppress his rights. People in this Chamber may have had the experience of a parent who seemed invincible to them as though they would live forever. They might find themselves in that situation - lifting their parent on to the bed and looking after their intimate care needs. These are acts of love. This is not about the passive denial of somebody's rights. This is not about incompetence. This is about the proactive and premeditated use of the assets of the State to suppress the rights of our most precious citizens and I do not regard that as a sound strategy. I regard it as reprehensible. It violates the very social contract that exists between us as elected representatives and the people who vote for us and erodes public confidence in these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I ask Members to support me in calling for a full debate so that we find out precisely what happened here. If it is the case that the State's assets were used and mobilised and the State set its face against its own people, there needs to be accountability. I support the statement by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Bacik, to the effect that this could be a watershed moment. We could get something positive from this in looking at the role of the Attorney General. Government by the people should be for the people. Society is measured by the way it treats its most vulnerable citizens and if that is our measure, it is reprehensible.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">Senator Clonan is right. Society is measured by how it treats and values its most vulnerable. That is something none of us should ever forget. I am calling for a debate with the Minister for Justice on the motion passed unanimously in this House last week calling for a dedicated public transport Garda unit. My party campaigned on this issue in the last general election and included it in its manifesto. It did not make into the programme for Government but we have continued to work on this issue. Antisocial behaviour in any part of life is completely unacceptable. There is a particular focus on having gardaí deployed on public transport because as we are all trying to adjust and embrace climate action and reduce our private vehicle usage and encourage others to use or work in public transport, we need to ensure that it is not only reliable, efficient and affordable, it is safe. The results of our survey say that the vast majority of public transport workers and users who responded to it find it unsafe and would welcome the presence of gardaí on public transport. I would appreciate it if the Deputy Leader could arrange a debate in the House with the Minister for Justice on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Regarding the protests that are taking place around the country, I will not go into great detail because most of the points have already been made. It is incumbent on everybody, not just those in these Houses, to remember that to live free from fear of violence, intimidation and abuse is a basic human right. Each one of us needs to remember that. Let us not make excuses for attending protests that are designed to spread fear, intimidate and threaten violence. There is no excuse for it from anyone.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I absolutely support Senator Fitzpatrick’s point. I also support Senator Ardagh's comments highlighting the work of Drimnagh For All and Ballyfermot For All, of which we are both part, and the extraordinary coming together of the community to celebrate the diversity and inclusion and the spirit of welcome in the community. That is right and fantastic.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Speaking about the likes of Drimnagh, of all the community organisations and representatives within that community, Dynamic Drimnagh is coming together. It has the most amazing strategic plans. It highlights all of the incredible work that is done on the ground in Drimnagh and it is fantastic. Hence, Drimnagh For All was easy to be birthed because there was already amazing work on the ground welcoming, including and ensuring an inclusive community there. However, funding these organisations and funding infrastructure for the community of Drimnagh are very low on the list. For instance, in the past couple of years, one developer has put up two developments that have netted Dublin City Council more than €11 million, yet none of that is being spent in Drimnagh. In the past week, the council has announced beautiful tea rooms that will happen in Merrion Square and in other areas of the city, which will be funded by the development levies that are coming in from the likes of Drimnagh, which is seeing minimal investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> I agree and I understand this is the province of councillors and local authorities. However, I would ask that we have some level of oversight or interaction with the Minister. I wrote to both the Minister and Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage with me to find out whether we put in imposed criteria on local authorities. If there is a community that is underfunded for such a long time, there will naturally be dissatisfaction and they naturally will feel they are left out. It is important we address that and that there is equity. Where money is collected, a ring-fenced amount of that should be spent in that community for its infrastructure and care.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I fully support Senator Clonan and will support the idea of a debate on carers and people who look after those who are vulnerable. That is important. In the context of all that has been revealed in recent times, we need to have a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> While I understand people might have issues relating to migrants and developing centres, I absolutely deplore and abhor violence and people who are trying to stir up trouble. That is the last thing we want. We should all be resolute on that in this Chamber. By all means, we take on board the comments and concerns of people. However, some of the outrageous lies going out in social media are very concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> I want to use most of my time to speak about increasing interest rates. It now looks like we will have a further increase in mortgage rates. While I acknowledge the work done by the present Government, the Minister for Finance and indeed the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, we have managed to get to a place where the average mortgage rate here is 2.8%, which is the third lowest now in Europe. We have gone from being almost at the top down to 2.8%, which is the third best in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> My concern is about people who are on 6% and 7% mortgage rates, basically from vulture funds. Those people are in trouble already and I am concerned about them. There are a serious number of them. I heard the Minister for Finance speak about this and he is in talks with the Central Bank. I ask that we would agree to write to the Central Bank to express our concern on behalf of those people. The last thing we want is people in trouble with mortgages. It brings huge stress on families and children. It is a serious issue and I would like to see us address it. Perhaps we could get agreement from everybody that we would write to the Central Bank expressing our deep concern about that very high interest rate of up to 7% being charged by some vulture funds.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">I wish to raise, once again, the case of Julian Assange. Last week, while at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I attended a side event that was chaired by Dr. Pieter Omtzigt MP of the Netherlands and member of the European People’s Party. He is a very impressive politician who I have worked with before. He spoke passionately about why Julian Assange should be free. He spoke not just on the personal horrific treatment that Assange suffered, which was described, by the way, as a prolonged public execution, but also about the fact it is essential to the freedom of the press that a journalist should not be imprisoned and threatened with 175 years of imprisonment because he told the truth about war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas. That is why Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a host of newspapers across the world, including <i>The Irish Times</i>, have called for his release.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> That evening, I heard directly from Stella Assange, Julian’s wife, about the impact on his two young children of seeing their father locked up for 23 hours a day in horrific conditions at Belmarsh Prison, where he is released just for one hour a day. Let us be clear as to why this is happening. This is happening because the USA wants to send a clear message that if you tell the truth about what its armies did and its war crimes, you will face a lifetime in jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I was encouraged by the fact that there is a broadening cross-party consensus in Europe that we cannot stand for this and we have to stand up for freedom for Julian Assange. The Deputy Leader has taken courageous stands before. I ask her to call for his freedom today, along with her colleague from the European People’s Party, and call for a debate on the issue. We cannot allow this. We cannot pick and choose when it comes to human rights. If we rightly call out the crimes that Russia has made against people in Ukraine and we rightly call out the crimes against people imprisoned for speaking the truth in Russian, then we have to equally stand up for Julian Assange. The silence to date from far too many politicians is not acceptable anymore. I ask all of us to stand with Julian Assange.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I welcome the move by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O’Gorman, to formally bring childminding into childcare regulations. I welcome the language he used when he said that it is to be in a way appropriate to the home environment. My family has used childminders and I had a childminder in County Tyrone all those years ago. In fact, her name is Bridget Hughes and I chose Bridget as my confirmation name. I passed that on to my daughter, who is Rebecca Bridget, so we had a lovely day yesterday. It shows the power and impact of the childminding relationship and feeling part of their family. I really appreciated that.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> We do not want to scare off women who have decades of experience in this. We have to do it in a sensitive way. At the same time, at the moment, childminders or the people in the home do not even need to be vetted. They need access to supports, training and first aid. Of course, we have the national childcare scheme bringing in subsidies for parents who use childminding as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">My two criticisms are that it looks like it will take a long time - it could take three to five years although there might be some movement in 2024 - and that it needs to be ambitious. We have a major issue when it comes to the supply of baby rooms. Other countries use an approach to childminding called "day parents". More men do it - two men are registered with Childminding Ireland - and it is a more standardised approach. We should also be looking at models like that. Our city and council childcare committees should have representation from the childminding sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Will the Cathaoirleach indulge me for one minute to say how much my thoughts are with Michael Gallagher this morning? His son, Aiden, was murdered in the Omagh bombing in 1998. Chris Heaton-Harris is to announce today whether the British Government will hold an inquiry. An inquiry led by both the British and Irish Governments is needed. The victims and survivors deserve that.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">Last Saturday I was privileged to stand with county councillors and people from local communities such as Ballyfermot, Bluebell, Clondalkin and Drimnagh, people from working class communities. I do not like saying the far right or far left and all this crap. If you give a damn about people, you give a damn about people, end of story.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> However, to see the number of people who showed up on Saturday was heartwarming for me. While we focus on racists and hatred in this House, there are only approximately 20 people in all of Leinster House, including the two Houses, who really care about those on the margins of Irish society. That is out of 220 people. It is a sad time to see the hate that is going on in our society. Yesterday on social media - I try not to look at these videos of hate - a man minding his own business walking down the street was stopped by a bully. If a member of the Traveller community did it, we would be called "knackers" and "scumbags" but it is okay for those who are bullies in our society. They are nothing more than bullies.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> What we need to do is work with our local communities that are already on the margins of society. It is the job of all of us in the House to bring them back and make them realise that other human beings are not the problem. I keep bringing this up. It is the policies and legislation we have in place. People could say that we are part of the Government and it is not our fault, but is the fault of all of us. We need to be true to our communities. End of story.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> To see the racism in this House, to see that Members of this House can stand up and speak so much hatred of immigrants, of people coming into the country. Shame on them. They do not know what it is like to be at the margins of society. Having a trans friend does not mean you will stand with trans people. Having a Traveller friend does not mean you will stand up with Travellers. It is not about saying in this House "I stand with". There is no right or wrong way to be a racist. There is no such thing as a nice racist. If you act to be racist, the "but" does not stop it. The "but" still makes the person feel rejected and hated.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">I will continue the conversation about how we support our local communities. This morning the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, launched a guide for inclusive community engagement in local planning and decision making. It is a good start to many things but I briefly glanced through the document and there is nothing compulsory in it. It is guidance. There is no financial support to local government and no training.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> We have a legal responsibility under our public sector duty. It is in the Act that set up the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. We have responsibilities to enable our communities to rise. This is a good starting point, but we need to look at it and pull it apart to see how we can support it in a local community. If we do not engage with communities, including marginalised communities; if we do not have a full-time officer in our local governments working, listening and understanding what is going on; if people in the planning departments of our local authorities do not understand what accessible planning and development are, we will not get the answers. This is a lovely guide about engagement, but there is nothing statutory in it. There is no stipulation about how projects should be examined. No funding should be given to local government for projects that are not disability proofed or inclusivity proofed. No funding should be handed over to anyone for projects that are not inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> I ask for a debate on integration with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, as if we raise one community, we raise every community. It will cost less in the long run to be inclusive and will make a better stronger community. We need full-time workers in our local authorities. We need active engagement.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">I welcome the Heritage Council funding for biodiversity officers for a number of local authorities that was announced this morning. We still need to see more local authorities come on board. Funding has been announced for Galway County Council and it is at an advanced stage of getting that person on board, but we also need to see it for Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Biodiversity is important. We see it happening. In Roscommon we have the Ballydangan Bog Red Grouse Project which has been amazing. It has been bringing landowners together with ecologists to protect the environment. The project manages the landscape to protect curlews. The shooting or hunting club works with farmers and landowners to protect curlews. One of the highest numbers of pairs of curlews in Ireland are based in the Ballydangan Bog Red Grouse Project. This is a shining light for so many areas . It is based in the bogs around Moore and it is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Biodiversity happens in our communities and it is important we have officers to help and work with communities, farmers and landowners on the ground. Everything is not separate to policies in headquarters in local authorities. It must happen with community groups on the ground. I acknowledge that and the people who do the work such as Galway's Living Bog in Mountbellew which is another great project. It is making the bog come alive for community groups and students. It has built a walkway where people can explore and see some of the bogs and wetland areas. It is wetlands day today.</p>

The contract will cost somewhere north of €1.3 billion for five helicopters over four bases. Our colleagues in the UK have 18 helicopters over 12 bases for €1.6 billion. We will pay roughly €250 million more per base over the ten years of the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I heard the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on Newstalk radio yesterday evening - it is there for everyone to listen to - talking about how they had to go after the HSE charges against the old and the impoverished families and how they had to take legal advice. I have been screaming at him for two and a half years, asking him to look at what is going on in his Department. He is more concerned about the old age pension some pensioner has robbed in a nursing home than he is about looking at what is going on in his Department. I have a letter from him and his colleague at the time, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, stating they did not know what was going on with this contract but they trusted the officials to do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Over recent weeks and months we are hearing time and again that the advice of the Office of the Attorney General or of the Department was taken. We can no longer continue to hide behind advice that is not made public. It is simply not good enough. This morning, we talked to the Department of Transport regarding a marine accident investigation. I am told, with respect to the death of Caitríona Lucas, that some people were not interviewed as a result of that accident but, of course, we are not allowed to see the report and we will never know. The bottom line is that it is time to come out in the open. The public are able to take the information when it is given to them. The public are not afraid. I would ask that we stop hiding behind things, start looking at the pounds and leave the pennies to mind themselves.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">I ask for a debate on road safety. As of yesterday, four more people died in the month of January than the previous January and, unfortunately, two more people died last night in a very sad crash. My condolences go to their families and all friends in County Mayo. That is six more people who died in this calendar year than the previous calendar year or 20 people as opposed to 14 people. One person is too many but 20 is certainly too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Yesterday, representatives of the Road Safety Authority appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, mainly about the national car test and delays in the provision of driving tests, but I also asked them about road safety figures. A staggering statistic given, which the chief executive said staggered him when he discovered it, was that 40% of driver fatalities were people who had not been wearing their seatbelts, which is surprising in this day and age. The statistic surprised me and the chief executive, who is a man who works on road safety all day, every day. A total of 40% of driver fatalities involved people who had not been wearing their seatbelts. It is so annoying to get into a car and not put on a seatbelt because the car will make a pinging noise and most cars have had that facility for a very long time. We need a renewed effort when it comes to road safety. One accident ruins families and a fatality more so. We need an emphasis on drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and everybody who uses roads to improve road safety and the road environment. We can never be complacent about road safety. The number of fatalities has greatly reduced and is much better than it used to be. We have more cars on our roads and more people in this country. We need a debate on road safety and what we can all do, as users of the road space, to help roads be safer for everybody's benefit.</p>

          <from>Senator Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_155">I thank colleagues for all of the topics they have raised this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senator Horkan is right. I will arrange and request a debate because it very much does feel, not just this year but in recent years, that we are going backwards from some of the huge successes we have had in the reduction of the number of fatalities over the years. We all know the good work the Road Safety Authority does, particularly in the promotion of road safety. It is very sad to see the number of people who have lost their lives increasing. I send my condolences to the families and friends of the two young men who lost their lives in County Mayo last night. I will ask the office to arrange the debate as quickly I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I am not sure what Senator Craughwell is asking of me other than what he has raised this morning certainly puts things in stark contrast in terms of priorities. I suggest that we seek a debate on the value for money aspect of the contract. We have had that before but we are obviously not done with it yet. I will arrange the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I am sorry to say to Senators Craughwell and Boyhan that I cannot accept their amendment. I am instructed that I have to push on today. For the information of the House, No. 2 was debated on two separate occasions at the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight. I acknowledge the request made and apologise that I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Senator Dolan spoke about the appointment of biodiversity officers in local authorities. It is welcome to see that announcement. It is surprising it has not happened before, but it does shine a light on the individuals in all local authorities who are doing those biodiversity roles as leadership roles because we can cite many projects, as the Senator did, in all counties where local authorities are championing projects to make sure we are cognisant of the environment in which we live and, more importantly, sympathetic to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Senator McGreehan asked for a debate on the guidance that was announced this morning by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for inclusive engagement with communities. I will request the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> I thank Senator Flynn for her impassioned speech and acknowledgement that there are far more of us who will stand against racism in this country and who are willing to accept and welcome refugees who flee persecution of many kinds. That is notwithstanding that there are some legitimate concerns that have been raised that need to be addressed by this Government, particularly by our new Minister with responsibility for integration. The lack of communication with communities is a real problem. It allows fear to be stoked up by genuine people who, if they are addressed in a proper and timely manner, would have their fears completely addressed and assuaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Senator Currie spoke lovingly about her childminder, Bridget. I think we all have similar memories of aunties or family friends who minded us as kids. They have a special place in all of our hearts. It is very welcome that the Minister has included childminders in the State supports for families who very willingly use childminders.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The Senator also spoke about Michael Gallagher. Our minds are with all of the victims of the Omagh bombing. I wholeheartedly agree with her that an investigation must be done not just by the UK Government but also by the Irish Government to give people answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> On Senator Gavan's issue, the last time he raised it I told him I was not fully briefed. I have read a bit more about it since and it is absolutely outrageous. Apart from the appalling treatment of the man and the impact on his family and on the people who support him, what is really outrageous is that the world society expects more from modern democracies. We expect them to act with decency and integrity. While we raise many issues about Russia and China, we probably have a view that those countries are not quite as democratic as we are. Therefore, it is not that the infringements from a human rights perspective are not as outrageous but that we do not expect them to act in the same way as we expect modern democracies to act. One of the most modern democracies we all know, and in many cases it is cited as being an example of best behaviour, is the United States. Certainly, the US has not acted in a gracious way in this instance. In fact, it has been appalling. What is appalling is that other modern democracies are going along with the - charade is not a strong enough word - what I assume are the wishes or the instructions that have been handed down. I do not believe my calling for Julian Assange's freedom here today is going to make any difference, but we should have a debate not just on him but on human rights abuses and on any other issues people may wish to raise.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I will arrange the debate in the next couple of weeks and I hope we will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator Murphy raised an issue that was raised at our parliamentary party meeting last night. Maybe the momentum has not grown because people are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis on top of their mortgage costs or maybe it is due to the fact that fixed-rate mortgages or interest rates generally in Ireland have not been impacted upon quite the same as other European countries, but by all means it will. One of my colleagues mentioned last night that they know someone whose mortgage has increased by more than €1,000. I do not know any family who could be expected to take such an increase on the chin and carry on, especially when the cost of everything else has increased. It is something we need to debate, but I will certainly ask the Leader to draft a letter to the Central Bank raising our concerns. What concerns me are the statements by the Governor of the Central Bank in recent weeks that there is nothing to see here and we should just carry on and expect it. I do not think we can expect people to suck it up when mortgage rates could probably increase by anything between 40% and 50% due to the increases from 2.6% or 2.8%, which is currently the average here, to anything between 4% and 5%, which would be catastrophic for some families. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Boyhan spoke about mother and baby homes. The debate was quite difficult to listen to last night because the concerns that have been raised by individuals, their families and their supporters are very real. That is notwithstanding that the current offering goes beyond what the commission that conducted the investigation offered or proposed to offer. There are still some queries to be debated and we will do that in the House when it comes. I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> What Senator Seery Kearney raised is startling and it is not unique to Drimnagh, Dublin City Council or any other council. We have councils that receive enormous development levies in particular areas and those moneys are spent in other areas. Senator Keogan also knows this to be true. It is not good enough. The question of holding local authorities to account at the Committee of Public Accounts or at any other committee has been raised on numerous occasions and it is not viable, apparently. We therefore have local authorities that are not accountable to anybody other than their own board, which is the elected county councillors. Either they do not agree in such large numbers or, as we know, local areas only have a smaller number of councillors on local area committees than the wider council.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">There is definitely something not right, and we definitely have areas where communities have had to take very large developments, maybe not as openly or willingly as they would have liked. They have to take them yet the spoils of those benefits go somewhere else, and it is not right. I will raise the matter with the Minister and maybe ask him to come here for a debate to see what we can do to hold the developers more accountable or if we can put directives into the rules relating to the Local Government Act to make sure there is an equality of distribution of rates once the council accepts them through the development.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I will ask for a full debate on the matter Senator Clonan raised. It is not scheduled for next week because we did not know whether we would have all the documents from the Department of Health next week, but it will certainly be scheduled for the week after. As for the disability payments, sometimes I think I cannot be shocked any more by some of the things we uncover, but I am so shocked that a memo that was not even brought to the Cabinet for approval could somehow have become policy in the Department of Social Protection. Having been in that Department for so many years, I am shocked to my core that we would have treated people in such a vulnerable situation in this way simply because we thought the State was paying for their keep in some other congregated setting. I do not know who in the Department leaked the documents or who the whistleblowers are, but they are certainly bringing to bear information that we, as a society, absolutely need to know, as well as recompense. I am very pleased that the Taoiseach yesterday said unequivocally that there needs to be redress in respect of the disability payments and that we need to find out exactly who these people are and make sure they are compensated. More importantly, however-----</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Senator Ardagh spoke about supporting refugees but called for a review, as I think others have done, of the international protection process. Senator McDowell made a very valid point on RTÉ on Monday night. There are differences between some of the people who are presenting for international protection. There are different reasons, and we need to acknowledge that. That difference and those reasons feed into some of the fears people are expressing which we hear on the radio and on the television at the moment. We need to take an all-encompassing look at how we communicate with people, how we address the system and how we look at people who are genuinely in need of help and make sure we give them the most decent setting or environment to live in for as long as we can, until they either become Irish citizens or get to the end of their process. We need to look at the length of the process. I had a conversation with an ambassador who more or less pointed to the fact that Ireland is a soft touch in the way we act on this. Yet, although our system takes far too long because of the way our courts systems work, I think we allow people every single opportunity to make their cases. I think that is a good thing; I do not think it is a bad thing, and I do not think curtailing the process into six months or two years would do them justice. I definitely agree with the Senator, however, about looking for a review of the international process.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Senator Wall looked for the circular economy Bill to be debated, which I will request.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> He also raised something that I do not think is unique to Kildare. I have a little 12-year-old lady in Swords who has no place to go to school this September, which is affecting her mental health. The Minister for Education will be in the Chamber on 15 February to discuss education and school places, so I do not even have to ask for that debate because it is coming. Also, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will be here on 22 February to discuss a lot of the items we have raised here this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> In response to Senator Black, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will be here on 22 February, but I thank her for her contribution because everything she has said is very true.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Senator Warfield spoke about the recommendations of the Youth Arts Now report, on which he sought a debate. I will ask the Minister to come in for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Senator Keogan raised the Ashtown incident and the camp for migrants. The incident over the weekend represented a low point in how we treat people in this country, so I am glad the Garda is taking appropriate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The Senator also spoke about the St. Patrick's Festival announcement. The thing that grabbed me most about the announcement, while it is lovely to see we are back to normal and everything is gung ho again, was the €250 ticket price for ordinary Irish people to sit on the side of the road. I do not know if we have completely lost the run of ourselves, but I wrote to the Minister yesterday to say I do not know what that is about. I told him that the tickets should be free and that admission should not be charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Senator O'Loughlin spoke about her pride for St. Brigid. She also raised a really important issue with the school books scheme. It is not acceptable that we think our schools will go to the book producers and cut out the middle men and all the shops that have looked after us for so many years, so we will raise that with the Minister too.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Senator Kyne opened the debate by speaking about the short-term letting Bill and looked for a debate on the pre-legislative scrutiny report once it comes to us. We will have that report here as soon as we can.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_260">I am delighted to be here in Seanad Éireann to commence the passage of the Family Courts Bill. This Bill represents a major milestone on the path to achieving the commitment in the programme for Government to enact a family courts Bill to create a new dedicated family court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a less adversarial resolution of disputes.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Reform of family justice and access to a courts system that is less adversarial and reduces the costs of dealing with family issues has long been advocated for. This is not new; it has been sought for many years. It is my aim, as Minister for Justice, and that of the Government and Minister without Portfolio, Deputy McEntee, that a reformed family justice system will enable cases to be dealt with more efficiently and in a way that should ensure better outcomes for families and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The measures in the Family Courts Bill will be supported by the first national family justice strategy which was published in November 2022. The strategy is foundational in nature, recognising the many issues that currently exist with the family justice system and the steps needed to begin its much-needed reform. The Family Courts Bill will provide many of the building blocks essential for this reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The legislative changes put forward in this Bill were supported by the work of the family justice oversight group, which developed the family justice strategy. Its work was informed by a wide-ranging consultation process and I thank everyone who partook in that process. The group heard from those most impacted by their experience of the family justice system, including children and young people, and crucially heard their views on what a reformed system should look like. The strategy, which will be implemented over the next three years, has nine goals and more than 50 actions, with the aim of establishing a strong foundation for a future system which is more child- and family-centred, which supports and protects, and which is more streamlined and user friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I will now outline the purposes of the Family Courts Bill and provide an overview of the main provisions. The Bill provides for the establishment of family court divisions within the existing court structures. There will be a family High Court, a family Circuit Court and a family District Court, each dealing with family law matters as appropriate to its jurisdiction. Each of these family court divisions will have judges assigned to them on a full-time basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> The Bill provides a set of guiding principles for the family court system to make the best interests of the child a primary consideration in all family law proceedings, to operate in an efficient and user-friendly manner and to encourage active case management by the courts. The courts, legal practitioners and parties to family law proceedings will be required to have regard to these principles in the conduct of family law proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> A further aim of the Bill is to enable a greater proportion of non-contentious family law matters to be dealt with at District Court level, in order to minimise the costs for litigants and to provide local access to our court system. That is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_267"> A new provision included in the Bill will enable joint applications to be made by spouses or civil partners for judicial separation, divorce or dissolution of civil partnership. At present, one spouse or civil partner must bring proceedings against the other under the adversarial system. The changes should support the use of mediation and alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Part 1 of the Bill sets out standard provisions relating to the Short Title, commencement, interpretation, repeals and expenses. The Bill will apply to proceedings under the enactments listed in the definition of "family law proceedings" in section 2. Section 3 will enable the Minister to make regulations to prescribe additional enactments for the purposes of the definition of "family law proceedings".</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Part 2 provides for guiding principles to help ensure that the family court system will make the best interests of the child a primary consideration in all family law proceedings and will operate in an efficient and user-friendly manner. The courts, legal practitioners and parties to family law proceedings will be required to have regard to these principles in the conduct of family law proceedings. Key principles include: ensuring the best interests of every child involved, or likely to be affected, by the outcome of family law proceedings are primary considerations in the conduct of the proceedings; ensuring that the child's views are ascertained, where practicable, and given due weight, having regard to the child's age and maturity; encouraging and facilitating as far as possible the resolution of issues in dispute by means of alternative resolution methods, such as mediation, except in cases where this would not be appropriate, such as domestic violence cases; promoting and engaging in active case management practices; and conducting proceedings in a manner which is user friendly for the parties, identifies the issues in dispute, minimises conflict between the parties as far as possible, facilitates agreement being reached on the resolution of the issues in dispute, and is expeditious and likely to minimise costs of the proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The introduction of guiding principles for the conduct of family law proceedings provides for a particular focus to be placed on the needs of the families involved in proceedings by the courts, legal practitioners and the parties involved in the proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Parts 3, 4 and 5 make detailed provision for the establishment of the family high court, family circuit court and family district court, respectively. Each of these courts will have a principal judge and a number of ordinary judges assigned to it. The number of ordinary judges may from time to time be fixed by Acts of the Oireachtas. Judges assigned to the family high court, family circuit court, and family district court will have met certain criteria, including that, by reason of their training or experience, those judges are suitable to deal with matters of family law. Ongoing professional training in the area of family law will be required of family court judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> To ensure proper and effective management of these court divisions, the Bill provides that new positions of principal judge of the family high court, family circuit court and the family district court will be created to manage the business of each of the family court divisions, respectively. The principal judges will also be empowered to issue practice directions in relation to family law proceedings in the family court divisions. The Bill provides for the assignment of the principal judges by the president of the relevant court having had regard to recommendations regarding the selection process made by the Judicial Appointments Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The Bill also provides that the family court will sit to hear family law proceedings in a different building or room from that in which other court sittings are held or on different days or at different times from other court sittings, with limited exceptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Part 6 provides for the establishment of a specific family law rules committee. Currently, rules of court relating to family law proceedings are made by the District Court rules committee, Circuit Court rules committee and Superior Court rules committee. Establishment of a specific family law rules committee would ensure the rules in relation to family law proceedings are coherent and applied with consistency across all levels of the family courts. As an alternative to a specific family law rules committee, provision is made in Part 6 for the establishment of family law subcommittees of the existing court rules committees. These subcommittees would have the function of proposing family law rules to be made by those rules committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Part 7 provides for amendments to existing courts legislation to include appropriate references to the new family court divisions. I will outline some of the most important provisions of Part 7. Section 59 provides that judges of the family courts shall undertake training courses as required by the principal judge of each court in consultation with the president of the court in question and in consultation with the Chief Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Section 68 provides that where an enactment confers concurrent jurisdiction on the family courts, an applicant should not initiate proceedings in the family high court without special reason to do so. Where proceedings are initiated in the family high court without special reason, the court may transfer those proceedings to a lower court.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Part 8 includes key provisions of the Bill relating to the jurisdiction of the family high court, family circuit court and family district court, and provides for the amendment of enactments relating to family law proceedings. Section 69 provides for the family district court to have unlimited monetary jurisdiction in consent cases. Where a judge of the family district court is satisfied that the parties have reached an agreement on the subject matter of the proceedings and they have consented to the proceedings being determined by the family district court, the proceedings can be determined at family district court level without a limit as to monetary jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Section 70 provides that the family district court may send forward proceedings to the family circuit court where there are special circumstances in the proceedings that would make it more appropriate for the proceedings to be dealt with by that court. Section 71 provides that the family circuit court may remit or transfer proceedings to the family district court where it would be more appropriate for the proceedings to be dealt with by that court or if it is considered that the proceedings should have been commenced in the family district court in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Part 8 provides for the family district court to have jurisdiction in a wider range of family law proceedings than is currently provided for in family justice legislation. It is proposed that the family district court will have jurisdiction concurrently with the family circuit court and family high court in judicial separation, divorce and dissolution of civil partnership proceedings, as well as cases taken by qualified cohabitants. The new jurisdiction of the family district court in divorce, judicial separation and dissolution of civil partnership proceedings will be subject to a monetary jurisdiction limit of €1 million in relation to the market value of any land to which the proceedings relate. The €1 million limit may be altered by ministerial order, up to a maximum of €2 million. These changes are provided for in sections 80, 84, 85 and 90. Similar changes are proposed in relation to cases under the Family Home Protection Act 1976 and the Family Law Act 1981, as provided for in sections 76 and 78. The monetary jurisdiction limit will not apply in cases where a judge of the family district court is satisfied the parties have reached an agreement on the subject matter of the proceedings and they have consented to the proceedings being determined by the family district court.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Part 8 also proposes to increase the monetary jurisdiction of the family district court in maintenance matters. Section 75 provides that the monetary jurisdiction of the family district court in relation to payments that can be ordered under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 will increase to €500 per week for maintenance and €50,000 for lump sum payments. Section 77 provides that the monetary jurisdiction of the family district court in relation to maintenance applications under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 will increase to €1,500 per week for the support of a spouse or €500 per week for the support of a child. Section 90 provides for corresponding amendments to the maintenance provisions in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The jurisdiction of the courts under the Child Care Act 1991 will be changed by section 82 to allow complex child care cases to be brought to the family circuit court. Special care cases will continue to be dealt with at High Court level by the family high court.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Part 8 also amends the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989, the Family Law Act 1995, the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 to allow for joint applications to be made under those Acts for judicial separation, divorce, dissolution of civil partnership and ancillary orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Part 9 sets out the detailed rules applicable to attendance at and reporting of <i>in camera</i> family law proceedings. Part 10 contains transitional provisions which seek to ensure continuity of the administration of justice. An important provision is section 103, which provides that any order made in family law proceedings by the High Court, Circuit Court or District Court which is in effect immediately before the operative date will be deemed to have been made by the corresponding family court division. The section also makes provision relating to orders made outside the State that have been recognised by the Irish courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Schedule 1 sets out the legislative provisions to be repealed by the Bill. Schedule 2 sets out amendments to be made to various enactments.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> As regards pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the general scheme was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny in October 2020. In December 2021, the Chairperson of the committee wrote to the Minister for Justice to advise that the committee had agreed not to undertake further pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme and that the submissions received by the committee would be referred for information and attention as appropriate in finalising the Bill. These submissions were carefully considered during the drafting of the Bill. It is a difficult but common reality for families to find themselves dealing with the breakdown of a relationship or trying to resolve a custody or maintenance issue for a child. These interactions often take place when people are at their most vulnerable and, unfortunately, the family justice system as it operates today does not offer a smooth transition through changes in a family's life. Long waiting times to access the courts, multiple journeys to court buildings as well as overly bureaucratic processes, a lack of available information about the system and, at times, high legal costs add to the already heavy burden of stress on families.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> It is important to ensure children are at the centre of the family justice system. As of 2015, the voice of the child in childcare, adoption, guardianship, custody and access proceedings have been enshrined in the Constitution. As such, it is now the responsibility of all those working within the family justice system to ensure the voice of the child is heard and considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> A key action of the family justice strategy is to examine the role of expert reports in family law processes, including their commissioning and availability, their content and use and making recommendations regarding their future application and function. I asked my officials to prioritise this critical work and I am pleased to confirm that work has now commenced on this action. My officials will be engaging with key stakeholders via the family justice implementation group in coming weeks and months to ensure the recommendations take account of their expertise and experience and bring about reforms to ensure the courts are supported by the best advice in ensuring the rights and needs of children are fully met.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> I thank Senators for the important work they will do on this legislation. I highlight the work being done by former Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke, who is leading a group examining the future of the civil legal aid scheme. Senators will be aware this scheme supports those of limited means to access legal advice and representation in a range of civil law matters. The reality is, however, that the majority of cases for which advice and representation is provided are family law in nature. The review is under way, with separate stakeholder and public consultation ongoing until tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> The Family Courts Bill marks a significant step forward. It is important we pass the legislation and make sure our family law justice system is child focused and child friendly and is reformed to meet the aspirations of Members of this House and the expectations of our citizens, of families at difficult times and, indeed, of our Constitution in ensuring the child's voice is enshrined.</p>

          <from>Senator Mary Seery Kearney<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">I commend the work the Minister has done in the Department of Justice and the work done by the Minister, Deputy McEntee. It seems no time since this was announced, in Government terms at least, and now here we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">We are commencing with the Bill and I really welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> There is no doubt that the family court and family proceedings have their own unique flavour and unique province. One is dealing with relationships that are, in most cases, going to have to endure for the entirety of the individual's and the child's life. These are people who must continue to engage. One day, for example, the parents will be at their grandchildren's christening together, so it would be good to have proceedings as harmonious as possible. I am very fortunate to be in a very functioning, loving and blended family, but that is rare enough. It is unfortunate when there is a lack of maturity or a huge amount of wounding, but at the heart of it there is an adversarial system that is not suited to the nature of family proceedings. There is slow access to the court and it takes a long time to resolve. In that time of waiting it exacerbates people's hurt and their sense of frustration of not being able to move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> In this, I am aware of a couple of things. Obviously, this can move very quickly and is not dependent on the building of a new family court building in Hammond Lane, as is promised, but do we have any idea of the timeline on that? That would be useful even from a practitioner point of view: people are either at Smithfield or in Dolphin House. I have had the experience of Dolphin House when I went for guardianship of our daughter, taking along my husband who was fortunately consenting to guardianship. The facilities there need to be upgraded. They need different facilities. When there is such an intensity of feeling in such a tiny space it make things incredibly hard. It is very important. I ask for a timeline for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I am aware that Women's Aid has a number of concerns, which will come to the fore when the Bill is on Committee Stage. I would ask that we make sure we are engaging with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Part of this Bill led to a promise on the rates of pay for solicitors with the Legal Aid Board. I will touch on this matter very briefly. Uniquely, the solicitors who go in to work with the Legal Aid Board do not have the same opportunity to come in at points and the grade as if they had joined the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Chief State Solicitor's office. They come in at a starting salary based on how long they have been working there. The unfortunate point of this is that it is very low wage to start. There is, therefore, a rapid turnover of very good and committed people in there, and it will not attract the very high-calibre and experienced people because they would have to take a wage cut to work at the Legal Aid Board. As a consequence, families and those in need of solicitors in the Legal Aid Board do not get the benefit of very experienced people, and the turnover of people is just too much. I had raised this early on with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the view was that within the context of this Bill coming into being, it would be looked at. It is important this happens because of the experience lost. </p>
          <p eId="para_296"> With family law it is so urgent that we move to a different method. I practised in this area for a very short period of time and realised very quickly that my aptitude was not in that direction when at one point I found myself shouting at my client outside the High Court for the manner in which he was leaving his children without funding and without support, and for how intolerable I thought that was. I thought to myself that I could not adequately go in and do this. I would be breaking every vow I had ever made when it came to the law. It is, therefore, not an area I practise in.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Integral to this, if we are very much making sure that the best interests of the child are at heart, is that it is really important to support this with training and support for practitioners in the area. The tendency to write with a very adversarial emphasis is still there and it is important that not only do we have training but also on the other end of it to have a complaints mechanism. I believe there is a necessity to engage with the Bar Council and the Law Society in that regard to ensure they are practising in a different way once the Bill comes into being.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> I will use my last two minutes of speaking time to raise a matter that is particular to my own heart, which is in the area of surrogacy. I am aware that the officials with the Minister today have worked extraordinarily hard in this area. I have asked in this House for an idea on the timeline for when the legislative amendments will come in, so they can commence on Committee Stage. I have been ruled out of order as we are not allowed to ask that. I will just have to find a different way asking.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> Right now, today, there are women up and down this country who do not have access to their children because their children have been weaponised in the breakdown of that family. Today, there are applications to court for the court to take the child or children into care, or that the court intervenes where unreasonable activity is going on where the weaponising of the child is just horrific. This is while women do not have a right to a parental order to their own child. This applies also to same-sex couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I happen to be dealing with a number of women at the moment who are allowed to see their children for one hour per week, supervised, so this will coerce them into settling on the family home, or settling on other moneys that are owed, or something like that. It is really quite horrific. I read the solicitors' letters and it is outrageous. I have no means of making a complaint, because it is an adversarial system, but if I could I would. The day will come when I will read for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I have people ringing me several times a day about how unjust it is. We need to get to a place where the security of that family and the interests of those children, who are much wanted and much desired, are at the heart of the system. There are women who are cancer survivors who are now in a place where they are controlled with regard to access to their children. It is coercive control and it is all of those things as well. We also have people with terminal prognoses who do not have a pathway to ensuring they have the oversight of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Given that we are talking about family law, I would urge the Minister for Justice to use his good office to accelerate the delivery of the assisted human reproduction legislation, and to make sure there is no delay when it comes to the establishment of a regulatory authority. Given there are parental orders in respect of fathers, there is no reason we must wait until the establishment of a whole authority, no reason we cannot make direct applications to the courts and that court registrars do not undertake to notify the surrogacy register and donor register in those instances. There is no reason this could not be put in place. It is really important that this happens.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_303">I thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, for being here. It is my first time to talk with the Minister since his elevation to a second ministry as the Minister for Justice, and I congratulate him on that. I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive opening statement. What tends to happen in here is that we all repeat our briefing notes, which the Minister has already said in his opening remarks, so I will not do that. I thank the Minister for the very detailed analysis of what is promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I am not a practitioner, as are Senators Seery Kearney and Martin. I am not a barrister with the familiarity of the courts system as they have, but certainly it surprises me as to how it has taken so long to get to where we are. Why have we not done this years ago? This does not really matter now but it surprises me that all of these very sensible provisions are not in practice. I know it was in the programme for Government, which was agreed by the three parties, including Fianna Fáil. It is children centred and has had lots of consultations. There would be specialist judges dedicated to doing this full time, so they would get better and better at it and it would not be something they would dip in and out of. It would also be separate buildings or separate parts of buildings so the families and children are not interacting unnecessarily with other adults. This would be very positive because while it is a traumatic thing for anybody of any age to go to court, it is particularly so for families where children are involved in having to go into court. It is very helpful that it is being done in this way. This is what strikes me. Why did we not do all these very sensible things long before now? That said, the Bill is very positive. I certainly welcome it and I certainly do not want to delay the passage of the Bill through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is very useful that we are doing this. The Minister even gave us the word count of his speech. It is 18 minutes long and comprises 2,500 words. I am certainly not going to make a contribution of 2,500 words and 18 minutes by way of response. This is welcome and useful legislation. I am interested in the timeline as to how fast we can get it both through the Houses and in respect of what happens thereafter, that is, how soon will we see a building, see judges appointed and so on. These things obviously take time and we need to do it properly but it would be to the benefit of all of the users of the courts, the practitioners and, more importantly, the families and the children affected in particular, were this to happen sooner rather than later. I welcome this important Bill and support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad inniu. I also thank him for his opening outline of the statutory intention and content of the Bill. The opening contribution of the Seanad by Senator Seery Kearney was comprehensive and I commend the Senator on her well-known, respected, varied and ongoing work in the area of family law and of supporting parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I welcome this legislative initiative and am delighted that the Minister values it. It is very important on a whole range of fronts. For judges to be assigned on a full-time basis is crucial because full-time assignments bring a level of expertise, consistency in judgements, specialist knowledge and ongoing training in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I also welcome that more of the non-contentious matters, as they are referred to, can be dealt with at District Court level because family law is the one area of law that is different to the other ones, where emotions can sometimes run very high. When emotions run very high, people sometimes do not act in their best financial interest and it can be very expensive. The more we can do in the lower jurisdiction courts, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> I welcome the family law rules committee and the fact that alternative dispute resolution matters will be strongly encouraged. I further welcome that reporting will be continued. Dr. Carol Coulter has done great work on this and this is an area where one must be able to share with practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I believe, with the leave of the House, that I am sharing time with Senator Pauline O’Reilly.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">The heart of this is to be child-centred, which is very important. Perhaps on another day we could look at removing some of the legalese, to demystify the law, and to make it and the workings of the legal system more accessible to the people who use the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> A separate building is so important for family law matters. I recall a couple of years when the Circuit Court family law sittings did their best at a time when the courthouse was unavailable and the court sat in a nearby hotel with a ballroom, which was not appropriate. It was a licensed premises during the day. There was a long entrance to the court. I remember that people can be very stressed and worried if it is their first time in court. My last word was to my client to ask them not to worry as I was trying to calm the situation down. There was an emergency contempt of court matter immediately before us and the result of that matter was that the person who was found in contempt of court was shouting and screaming while being hauled out of a long corridor by two gardaí. The next thing was that my client had to walk down that foreboding corridor. It was highly inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> There is also the issue of the acoustics in court and I know that this will be a professionally assigned building on days when it is not sitting to hear other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> I recall once having a client whose family home was in jeopardy under a repossession order and nobody could hear anything in court. That was wrong. I remember the multiple visits to court which have to be tackled, together with the spiralling costs. I had another client where the person was sure that a protracted, contentious matter was going to be all over as it was in for final orders. The acoustics were very bad and I warned the client that it was looking very good that we would get our matter dealt with that day, and all of the rest. When we went back to the consultation room after our short hearing, my client surprised us with a gift of spontaneous refreshments. I had the task of apologising and telling her that the judge had not ruled, and had informed us that due to circumstances beyond his control that he could not deal with it that day. That was an extra annoyance and stress on that client.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> This, I inform the Minister, is all very good. I welcome the way the Minister is prioritising this and he has the full support, I hope, of everyone in the House. This is a very good day. A specialised divisional court to deal with this area is long overdue and I am very impressed with the monetary jurisdictions, and how there is flexibility within Government on regulations. Also, if parties consent, they can contract out, in a manner of speaking, of the monetary jurisdiction and have the matter heard at the lowest effective level, which will be less expensive on the parties, with the spiralling costs as they are. I hand over now to Senator Pauline O’Reilly and apologise if I have spoken at too great a length.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">The Minister is very welcome and I am delighted to be here today as someone who has worked as a family law solicitor myself. I feel very passionately about this piece of legislation and, indeed, I had the very great honour of being in the negotiations, along with the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, for the Green Party, with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It was a priority for us to put this into the programme for Government and this is a very significant day.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> It is completely true to say that family law cases are very traumatising for children. It is not just about the day one goes into court, or it is not just a day, but it is multiple days, often over many years. It is also about the fact that, in the home, people are preparing for an adversarial approach to family law. It is, then, looking for ways to build a case every day against somebody who is, essentially, part of one’s family and will always remain part of one’s family.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> It is completely correct that children are at the centre of this now and that we have separate buildings because, as my colleague, Senator Martin has said, I have also been in court with vulnerable people in family law cases where one has gardaí rushing past, people in handcuffs, which is particularly the case in Galway, and where so much goes on within that small footprint. Only barristers and solicitors, in fact, have a separate space where they can go, but clients often have to book a room in family law cases because one can be in and out for orders, sometimes, quite quickly. Usually, let us be honest about it, the parties are in the corridor having conversations and being overheard. It is very important to have that separate building.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I was also involved in collaborative law, which I believe is a very good approach but it is rare that it proceeds in that way. We have a legal obligation to speak to clients about mediation at the very start when one is taking on a case but again, given the nature of how some of those conversations happen -many of these cases do proceed to court - it is happening in an adversarial type of conversation.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> It is acknowledged that this Bill is not going to cover everything. Again, Senator Martin has mentioned that cost is very important and I know that Deputy Costello has brought up the issue of cost and greater access to legal aid. I would love to hear what the Minister's thoughts are on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I also note that Women's Aid have some concerns and certainly from working with people, it is very important to remember that children are the most vulnerable but there is often a vulnerable adult in that situation as well and negotiations take place with a vulnerable person.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Vulnerable adult children are also often in court and sometimes have had a long history of abuse within relationships. I am over time. I thank the Acting Chair for the latitude and opportunity to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Is Bille thar a bheith tábhachtach é seo agus, mar atá ráite ag comhghleacaithe eile, ceann a bhfuil ag déileáil le cásanna nuair atá daoine faoin a lán struis agus a lán brú. Cibé rud gur féidir linn a dhéanamh a laghdaíonn an strus agus an brú sin agus a chruthaíonn coinníollacha i bhfad níos fearr faoi choinne daoine agus iad ag dul tríd an gcóras dlí, is rud maith dearfach é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> State institutions of any description present difficulties on many fronts - too many to mention here - for those who find themselves using them. We have debated many times in the Chamber the need for the State's institutions to be much more user friendly and considerate of the people who pass through their doors. In particular there is a need to be aware of two dimensions, namely, psychological and resourcing. This is particularly the case when it comes to the relationship between people and the State's judicial institutions in their varied forms. We have heard very valuable first-hand experiences of that in the debate thus far. </p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Today, we are debating the Family Courts Bill. There is probably no other area of life which produces emotional tensions quite like a family in crisis and, unfortunately, potentially in breakdown. I am mindful, in addressing the Bill, that its constituency are stressed mothers, children, distraught parents and grandparents, fathers, siblings and relatives. They will have experienced coercive control, which is now a criminal offence because it is violent and destructive to family life, parental estrangement, a complete breakdown between parent and child, parental alienation or the hostility of a child to one of his or her parents induced by the other parent. All of these issues and many more potentially arise. </p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The reduced capacity of the courts during Covid also negatively impacted on families. Family breakdown is always a tough experience emotionally and financially. While these pressures are challenging enough for the families experiencing them, they then also have to manage the family law system, which falls far short of what it should be. Families are experiencing things such as lengthy delays waiting for a court date, adversarial and inappropriate settings to hear highly personal matters, the poor provision of ancillary court services and court-ordered assistance and delays in enforcing maintenance orders, which causes additional financial hardship, especially for mothers who are already struggling. </p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The proposal by Deputy Kerrane of Sinn Féin for a child maintenance service would help many families, as would the proposals from the Committee on Justice and Equality, chaired by my former colleague, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, which produced a report in 2019. It is a valuable report and I commend it to the Minister. The committee heard from wide variety of stakeholders and the report represents a solid basis for reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The current programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a family law court Bill to create a new dedicated family court within existing court structures and provide for court procedures that support a less adversarial resolution of disputes. It also promises to build a new family law court building in Dublin and to ensure court facilities across State are suitable for family law hearings so these hearings can be held separately from other cases. These measures are fully supported by Sinn Féin and we support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Legal reform and the building of a dedicated family law court for Dublin are of vital importance but any credible family law plan must go further and I appreciate that the Minister knows this, in particular in terms of supports. Not every issue before the court can be addressed at the point where relationships are breaking down. However, significant resources can and should be allocated to reduce the harms that can result to children and adults. Certain measures, if implemented, will make a significant contribution to making family courts work for families and children. Not only is that the intent behind this much-needed Bill, it can be the outcome. I look forward to working with the Minister and colleagues across the House to ensure that is realised.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important Bill, which the Labour Party will support. I note, as colleagues have said, that the programme for Government includes a call for a focus on reforming our family court system to ensure that proceedings involving children are dealt with in a manner that recognises the unique vulnerability and needs of children. That is the most important aspect of that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Like many Members across the House, I have dealt with vulnerable families who seek assistance and guidance from the State and who fear the legal system and what it may mean for them and their families. That is an important aspect of what we and the Government, through this Bill, are trying to do today. I welcome any attempt to reform the family courts system that puts the vulnerability and needs of children first and attempts to remove that fear for so many families.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I am dealing with current cases where the first thing I have to do is to reassure vulnerable families that the law is indeed on their side and they should continue down the legal route. It is alarming that this has to be the case. Assisting vulnerable families in their hour of need through our legal system must be a priority for all of us in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> I want to speak to the purpose of the Bill and go through some of the points that have been raised. I agree with the main purpose of the Bill, namely, to provide for the establishment of family courts as a division of each court's jurisdiction level. There will be a family High Court, a family Circuit Court and family District Court. </p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I want to refer to the section of the Bill that makes provision for a family court to sit and hear family law proceedings in a different building. Colleagues have raised this issue. When I sit down families in Kildare, one of the most significant things they say is that they are intimidated by what goes on in court. That goes back to the fear I mentioned. I welcome that we are now at last talking about a different room, something that was mentioned by colleagues in the debate on the Bill. I also support the idea that family courts will be held on different days, which will take away that fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I welcome that judges will be assigned to the court on a full-time basis. I agree with Senator Martin, who referred to the expertise that will bring to the judicial system. It is an important aspect of the Bill. Ongoing professional training is also referenced in the Bill. In fairness, those of us in the House engage in ongoing professional training. It also has to apply to those involved in the judicial system because things change. That is an important aspect of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The Minister mentioned cost in his opening speech. That is a prohibitive element for people engaging in law. I welcome the fact that the Minister is addressing that in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The Minister also mentioned former judge, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, and the closing date of 6 p.m. tomorrow for submissions to the civil legal aid review. Our legal aid centres are inundated with work at present and I seek a commitment from the Minister that he will continue to support them. I deal with a lot of people who are struggling to get appointments and be seen because of the number of cases that are going through the legal aid system. I welcome that a review is happening but I seek a comment from the Minister on where he sees that going. This all feeds into this issue because many people struggle to afford the cost of engaging with the legal system. </p>
          <p eId="para_340"> We all await the report from the review which is being carried out by the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke. We in the Labour Party look forward to the Bill. It is timely and we look forward to working with the Minister on the Bill in the House.</p>

        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_341">I join with others to express my broad support for the Bill. It is significant and a long-awaited milestone in the reform of the family justice system in Ireland. My colleague, Senator Ruane, who is also a member of the Committee on Justice, has tracked the Bill for a long time. She would like to have been here for the debate today, but cannot attend. She is, however, engaging an line-by-line reading of the Bill and is looking forward to engaging constructively in great detail in the coming weeks with the Minister and colleagues across the Upper House.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> The Bill promises a lot of important reforms to the family justice system, ones will make progress in addressing the deficiencies in the existing system which was not designed with families, in particular children, in mind. Specialised family courts systems have become standard practice across Europe and many common law jurisdictions. While Ireland is behind the curve, I welcome that the Minister and his Department have undertaken a lot of work to address this. It is important to commend the former Minister, Deputy McEntee, who did important work to push this forward and make the system fit for purpose. </p>
          <p eId="para_343"> We know many things might be in programmes for Government, but Deputy McEntee pushed this up the agenda to make sure that we are now at a point where we are debating a Bill. I commend the Minister and Deputy McEntee in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> I welcome that the Bill will establish family courts, with family courts at District, Circuit and High Court level becoming separate divisions within the current court structures. Other Senators have spoken about ensuring that the family court follows through at the level the cases are taken and having specialised Judiciary and legal practitioners, which will make the system more child and family friendly and less adversarial. The Bill will also streamline family law proceedings. The long delays in proceedings can often add greatly to what are already difficult and distressing times for people who, as eloquently described by the Acting Chair, will be together for a long time. Going through one or two years of difficult court proceedings can be damaging to lifetime relationships. I hope that the streamlined procedure will also mean that proceedings become less costly for the individuals involved as well as the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I welcome that the Bill provides for the establishment of a family law rules committee, which will develop a set of overarching rules and practice guidelines and help to build consistency in the new system in terms of procedures and judgments. The inclusion of national practice directions is important and positive and is helpful towards moving towards more consistent decision-making while retaining judicial independence. This is an area of concern. There are anecdotes about what judge a case gets and how he or she might approach it. There should not be a roulette system for how a case is handled. People should know the principles and practices that will be put in place and the kinds of consideration that will be applied consistently. This is important. Practice directions can often be developed more quickly than legislation or court rules and could help to ensure the system remains dynamic and informed by best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> I have a concern connected to one of the recommendations of the gender equality committee, of which the Minister may be aware. Better practice is badly needed in respect of court-appointed psychological assessments. These assessments are not clearly regulated and can be inconsistent. I know of cases – we cannot mention specific ones – where they have been used in an abusive way, with children weaponised and partners put through assessments multiple times. For example, a partner in a custody case who was better resourced was in a position to suggest a psychologist to the court and have that psychologist assess another individual. There is a major concern about something that should be a constructive element – psychological assessment – being weaponised. I wished to signal this as an area that may need to be addressed through the family law rules committee and, possibly, this legislation. I will revert on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Regarding the occasional abuse of the court system as opposed to just its inefficiencies, delays and inappropriateness, the Minister and Senators will be aware that a number of advocacy and campaign groups around domestic violence have advised that there are areas of the Bill they believe need reform and strengthening in order to reflect the needs of domestic violence victims. Domestic violence is a feature of a not insignificant number of relationships that break down. These groups are a key user group and it is important that they be listened to. When the Seanad pushed for the inclusion of coercive control as an offence – that measure came from the Seanad – one of the important messages was that the Government needed to listen to those with expertise in this area and to consider those who were using the system and their needs. I hope that we can strengthen the Bill in this respect. There will be opportunities to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The provision of out-of-court therapeutic family supports and alternative dispute services will be critical to the success of any new family court system. These should be free, accessible and carefully designed. For example, mediation is only appropriate sometimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I have many points to get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Advocacy groups have highlighted that the legislation does not adequately provide for the development of some of the necessary resources and structures around the provision of ancillary supports and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Legal practitioners have signalled a concern about the number of cases that may go to lower courts and the impact of this on, for example, the number of sitting judges needed at those levels to ensure sufficient capacity. We must not create a new bottleneck. Instead, there must be matching resources. In 2020, Ireland had one of the lowest number of judges per 100,000 inhabitants in the EU. The Department is awaiting research on this matter but the blunt figures point to a need for judges. Senator Wall referred to legal aid. Strengthening its provision and resourcing will also be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> The family law complex at Hammond Lane will be critical physical infrastructure in making all of this work in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> Senator Ruane has repeatedly highlighted the collection of child maintenance and legislation on same. This issue has been dealt with inappropriately through the courts and through difficult processes in the social protection system. Regrettably, there was not a clearer outcome from the working group on child maintenance regarding a child maintenance body, but the Minister may be aware that Senator Ruane has proposed legislation that has the support of the cross-party women's caucus in the Oireachtas. We are considering what legislative measures could be put in place. Given the difficult process of going to court, a legislative measure that removed that legal context from child maintenance would be positive. We may try to address the matter as part of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> We in the Civil Engagement Group look forward to engaging with the Minister on what is a positive initiative, one that has significant potential to be transformative for families. </p>

          <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2023-02-02T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_355">I thank Senators. The depth of feeling and priority they assign to this area is clear from their contributions. It was fascinating and insightful listening to the Senators' experiences. It reminded us of the urgency of, and reasoning for, doing this. Be Senators advocates, practitioners or both, it is clear that we have a wealth of expertise in the Seanad, which we will be eager to draw on as we work our way through the legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I acknowledge what Senators Pauline O'Reilly, Horkan and Martin stated. This was a priority during the programme for Government negotiations. It is lovely to be in a parliamentary chamber where there is a cross-party, bipartisan, non-partisan approach to getting this legislation right and getting it done. I thank Senators for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I also thank my colleague and friend, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, for her leadership and determination on this Bill. She would not forgive me if I did not keep it moving. I acknowledge the work and priority she has attached to the family justice system. Part of that work is culminating in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> If we are being honest, we in politics have a tendency to talk about milestones, significance and landmarks, but it is actually true in this context. It is not hyperbole. This legislation has the potential to be a major milestone and significant landmark law that reforms family law, puts the child at the centre of all that we do in that regard, moves away from the adversarial system and creates non-adversarial pathways that are operable and practical. I had a sense of it already, but I have an even greater sense of it now – if we want to move away from an adversarial system, it will of course involve the law, but it will also involve the buildings and acoustics. This point reminds me of the importance of approaching the Bill from a number of angles.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> The Bill's enactment will have a significant beneficial impact in terms of providing many of the key building blocks that we need to put in place in order to reform our family justice system and develop sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures for all families, but particularly vulnerable ones. I will examine the range of issues that Senators highlighted and give consideration to introducing appropriate amendments and teasing through the issues with Senators on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> I will endeavour to respond briefly to some of the points raised. I noted the question from my colleague, the Acting Chair, and other Senators around the Hammond Lane site.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I will get an update for the Senator and others on the Hammond Lane site. My understanding is that, more recently, the Courts Service Hammond Lane project board approved, in principle, the design plan of the buildings at its meeting on 28 November subject to a couple of amendments that are being addressed. I understand how significant that project is, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> There was a commonality to many of the points made by a number of Senators so I will not name everyone. Senators Seery Kearney and Pauline O'Reilly mentioned Women's Aid. I very much acknowledge its brilliance in terms of advocacy and what it does. I mean that extremely sincerely. We have a very good partnership approach with it on many important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I am aware of some concerns raised around difficulties experienced by victims of domestic violence relating to family law cases as they go through the court process. The roll-out of the family court division presents an opportunity to try to address these issues and make changes that will improve the court experiences of families and children in cases where domestic violence is involved. My Department and I will continue to engage with organisations, including Women's Aid, that work with victims of domestic violence. We will consider their suggestions on what changes are needed to ensure the establishment of dedicated family courts works to reduce difficulties that victims of domestic violence may experience in engaging with the courts. It is well known that we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to this, however. We certainly want this legislation to help and support victims and survivors of domestic violence in any way it can.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The issue with regard to Legal Aid Board solicitors was raised by Senator Seery Kearney. The issue of civil aid and legal aid, in general, was raised by Senator Wall and others. Among the terms of reference of the current review of civil legal aid is an examination of the modes of delivery of legal aid and advice provision under the scheme. The review group will be making recommendations regarding the future of the scheme and related systems to meet effectively the priority legal assistance of those with limited means as well as making recommendations related to the effective resourcing of the scheme to achieve it. I very much accept that Senators were making the point about resourcing and supporting it, and we will certainly do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The issue of training arose, which is quite important and is key. This is the benefit of having full-time assigned judges to the court. Ongoing professional training in the area of family law will obviously be required for family court judges. We now have the Judicial Council, which will be responsible for identifying training requirements. Improvement and training will be supported for all court staff and professionals working within the family justice system. That is important. Of course, it is about the judge, but it is also about all of the court staff in terms of the journey from the moment a person turns up to the end of the legal process. One element of meeting the strategic goal of supporting children in our family justice strategy is an action to engage with the Judicial Council and professional bodies to identify and deliver common and standardised child-focused training to all professionals working within the family justice sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I will comment on the point made by Senator Seery Kearney on the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022. The Senator reminded us, if ever we needed it, of the very significant urgency of making progress in this regard. I know this is a view shared by Senators across the House. The Senator made it very real for us in terms of the impact today on families going through challenging and difficult times, extraordinarily so in some cases. The Minister for Health and the Government are absolutely committed to bringing forward amendments as a matter of urgency. I will seek a detailed timeline and progression for the Senator on foot of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I acknowledge, as Senator Higgins did, Senator Ruane's interest in the Bill. I have absolutely no doubt Senator Ruane will go through this line by line and engage constructively, as she always does. I look forward to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Senator Higgins raised the issue of expert advice and reports. I touched on this briefly in my opening statement but ran out of time, so I would like to return to it. Who is an expert? Who is providing information that could be very influential in the outcome of a court proceeding, and does that person have the expertise to be as influential, if you like, in terms of a decision that could have a very profound impact on a child and family or perhaps on a vulnerable person. As Senator Higgins knows, Section 47 of the Family Law Act provides that the Circuit Court or High Court may order "a report in writing on any question affecting the welfare of a party to ... [family law] proceedings or any other person to whom they relate". Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be a "paramount consideration" for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody, upbringing of or access to a child is in question. Obviously, the courts and the Judiciary are independent. I very much get and respect that. It is a core tenet of our democracy. Assessors and experts in family law proceedings are formally appointed by the court itself and they are answerable to the presiding judge. The Family Courts Bill does not provide for any legislative change regarding these reports. I did say in my opening statement, however, that I asked my Department to prioritise the area around the whole issue of expert reports. I am pleased to inform the Seanad today that this review work has now commenced. This is an area to which we will be able to return and tease through the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> On judicial numbers, it is very important when we talk about judicial numbers to be aware, and I sometimes wonder whether it gets the attention it requires because people think it is about judges, that it is about the delivery of access to justice and delivering public services, in many ways. We do not have enough judges in this country. Let us be crystal clear. Yes, we wanted an evidence base to establish that but the Senator is right. We know without an independent report that we do not have enough judges. I received in recent days the report of the judicial numbers planning group. It is an excellent piece of work done by a group chaired by Ms Brigid McManus. I intend to engage with Government colleagues with regard to progressing this shortly. I believe there are key areas, whether it is housing, planning, family law, assisted decision-making, migration - you can pick a whole variety of areas - in which increased numbers can actually result in increased access to justice, but also very key societal priorities that need to be expedited. Expect developments on that shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I will also reflect on the comments regarding child maintenance. A piece of work was done between the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, in that regard. I am happy to engage further on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Let me end where I began by saying I am genuinely excited about this legislation. It is a very important piece of work. I thank everybody in the Department of Justice and beyond who has worked to get us to this point. We obviously want to get the legislation right and we will work with the Seanad to make sure we do that. We are now going to create divisions of a family law court throughout our court system. We will make sure there is a specific focus and route for people when family difficulties arise. We will make sure there is a system that is less adversarial and more effective in terms of cost and, therefore, more accessible to people, and that puts the child at the centre of all we do. That is our common objective. That is the message I have taken from Senators. I will reflect on the points they made today.</p>

          <p eId="para_376"> President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, on behalf of the Members of both Houses and on my own behalf I welcome you to this Joint Sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I also wish to recognise the Irish MEPs present, the members of the diplomatic corps and, of course, Ms Michelle O’Neill, MLA, who is also with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> President Metsola, <i>merba kbira fil-parlament Irlandi. </i>
					</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> President Metsola, you are very welcome to the Irish Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> We welcome you as the President of the ninth European Parliament - one of the key institutions of our European democratic structure. We salute you also as the third woman to lead that venerable institution, following the exemplary leadership roles of Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine. </p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Our European Union was founded on the values of peace and democracy. These values have been sorely tested since its foundation. We are now experiencing the greatest test in our lifetimes, with the war in Ukraine. It is almost one year since Russia started this unprovoked and unjustified war. In that time, it has caused inestimable damage to the fabric of Ukraine, which can and will be repaired with global economic support, but it has also caused irreparable damage to the place of Russia in the world and to the Russian people. The European Parliament will play an important role in building and maintaining support for the restoration of Ukraine and its inevitable accession into the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The Members of these Houses have had the pleasure of hearing recently from President Zelenskyy, who has become an extraordinary leader for his people, and we, as a people, have done our utmost to support the Ukrainian people and we will continue to do for many years to come. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> President Metsola, Ireland has been at the centre of the Union since we signed the Treaty of Accession to join the European Economic Community in 1972 and joined the Community on 1 January 1973. You speak to us today as we are celebrating 50 years in the Union. Membership has been truly transformative for our country. We went from being a small, closed economy and somewhat inward-looking society on the western outskirts of Europe to becoming a larger, ever more open economy with an export-minded and outward-looking people at the social and democratic heart of the Union. Most of the great social changes in Ireland over the past 50 years has been driven by European legislation and values - values which we were proud to willingly embrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> We have a saying in Irish - ní neart go cur le chéile. There is no strength without unity. We are truly stronger together.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> President Metsola, I invite you now to address these Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">Thank you. Dear Chairs, Taoiseach, Tánaiste, honourable Members of the Oireachtas, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me here today. It is an honour to be in Dublin’s fair city, representing the European Parliament, 50 years after Ireland joined what was then still the European Economic Community.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> We have come a long way together in five decades. From joining the Single Market to joining the euro, from helping to broker a peace to securing a Northern Ireland protocol. From opportunities to trade, travel and study to working to ensure social justice, respect for the rule of law, fundamental values and rights to live in dignity and safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> These European ideals are Irish values. The EU is not some faraway entity deciding for you. It is you. Ireland is Europe and Europe is Ireland. There is no decision that is taken without you. Dublin, Cork and Galway are the heart of Europe. When ten people lost their lives in Creeslough, we cried with you. When journalists like Veronica Guerin are killed for speaking up, we share your outrage and your determination for justice. When Ireland faced uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, your position was our position. We went through all of that together and we will stay together.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I was told that, 50 years ago, Irish married women were not allowed to work in the public service. It would have seemed inconceivable then that a woman - least of all one born on an island in the middle of Europe’s southern sea - would stand before you here today. That is part of what Europe can do, of how it can be transformational, of how it can be the leveller we need it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> We have come a long way but there is some way to go yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Europe is not only about funds for Irish farmers, cohesion, digitalisation, recovery, infrastructure, roads or clean tech. It is about a fundamental understanding that when we do things together, it benefits us all. It is about a shared destiny, a shared future.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> We have different languages, histories, cultures, traditions, beliefs and abilities but we share common values that are the foundation of everything that we do. The beauty of unity in diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> That great European Irishman, John Hume, once said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_394">Difference is the essence of humanity. Difference should therefore never be the source of hatred or conflict. Therein lies a most fundamental principle of peace: respect for diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Europe is not a homogenous bloc. It does not seek to make everyone the same but it is about trying to ensure equal opportunities, about levelling up, about ending intergenerational cycles of struggle, about the quest for real peace. There are few places in Europe where that message is as important and as well understood as in this great country.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> For 343 days now, Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of sovereign, independent Ukraine and the bravery of Ukrainian people have reminded us that progress and justice cannot be taken for granted. Democracy cannot be taken for granted. Europe cannot be taken for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> In the face of destruction, devastation and death, the Irish people continue to show solidarity in helping over 70,000 displaced Ukrainians. Irish people have a long history of showing empathy, of caring, of standing up. For that example to the world, I thank you. Maith sibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Since the Europe we want for the next 50 years is a Europe that cares, a Europe of real peace and a Europe of justice, we will keep standing with Ukraine in 2023, and for as long as it takes. No country can afford to go it alone. It is only together that we can bring back economic growth and find answers to the questions people ask of us as their representatives. This is also what Ukrainians are asking of us today. The European Union will continue to support Ukraine with financial aid, humanitarian aid and financial assistance, military support and practical solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> I thank the Irish across the country for their continued support for the European Parliament's Generators of Hope campaign to source electrical generators that allow essential facilities in Ukraine to keep running, in hospitals, schools, shelters and more. Since this country cares, you have proved that empathy is a sign of strength, time and again.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Former US President Barack Obama said it well when he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_401">Yours is a history frequently marked by the greatest of trials and the deepest of sorrow. But yours is also a history of proud and defiant endurance. Of a nation that kept alive the flame of knowledge in dark ages; that overcame occupation and outlived fallow fields; that triumphed over its Troubles – of a resilient people who beat all the odds.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">He was right. The story of Ireland is one of beating the odds, struggle, sacrifice, defiance and emerging stronger – lessons that Europe will need to draw on to face the year ahead. Make no mistake, we are living in times of polycrises: war, energy scarcity, electricity prices spiking, cost-of-living increases and inflation wiping value from assets, interest rates impacting government borrowing and housing markets, scarcity of raw materials and a global food shortage one short port blockage away. This is framed in the context of our still-ongoing recovery from the pandemic, the climate emergency and living through increased economic pressure from east and west, which is impacting our competitiveness. This has meant families struggle to stretch their wages to the end of the month. It has meant increased social pressure and people in Europe having to choose between feeding their children and heating their homes. It has meant increased homelessness and hopelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The challenges are clear across Europe but I know we can meet this moment head-on. The European Parliament's job is to help to provide the European regulatory framework for the challenges to be met and to show we can save jobs, create new economic niches, modernise and address climate change at the same time. That is what the Next Generation EU funds are about.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> We need to help our businesses and industries to compete. We can resist the temptation of overprotectionism but they need to have a level playing field, predictability and trust. That is how we can keep attracting investment and industry to Europe. We can learn from Ireland's remarkable macro-economic recovery and how you have managed to deal with the challenges of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Ireland will have a central role to play in addressing the challenges ahead, all the more so since the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, something the European Union regrets but respects as a democratic choice of a majority of British people. The European Union has not wavered in its solidarity with Ireland, and it is with civility and respect for the rule of law that the European Union and the United Kingdom will pursue their relationship. We will not leave your side.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Honourable Members, after 50 years Ireland continues to be an avid European Union team player, supportive of a European Union of values that strives for more equality, justice and care. One day after St. Brigid's Day, there is no doubt in this country that care matters. Healthcare must be accessible to all. During the pandemic, the European Union stepped up and led on healthcare. We were steadfast in securing vaccines and ventilators for all people in all member states. Now we need to go further and create a real health union. That is the best way that we can honour the unsung heroism of front-line workers and caregivers here in Ireland and around Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Social justice is high on the agenda of Irish Members of the European Parliament, whom I am happy to see here today. Irish MEPs have led the debate in Europe on mental health, the environment, gender equality, agriculture and farming, fighting domestic violence, femicide and so much more. Ireland has led. </p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I know the European Parliament has had a difficult few weeks but I am confident that we will fix our systems and rebuild trust. Of course, I would have preferred the world's attention to be on the great work that Members of the Parliament do every day, on the agreements we have reached on climate, migration and asylum, energy, funding and support for Ukraine, and on what we have done to protect the rule of law and strengthen our value-based approach. As your Taoiseach said a few weeks ago, the European project is a superpower of values. We should not forget that. It is important to remind people what Europe is all about and help them to recapture the sense of hope and optimism in our European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Next year, 2024, the people of Ireland will be called upon to vote for their representatives in the European Parliament. My appeal, to the young Irish in particular, is to choose. Vote. Your vote matters more than you can imagine. Your voice matters more than you know.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> Europe is not without imperfections or frustrations. I share many of the frustrations. I think we have to be honest about our failings as much as our successes. There is much that we can improve together, and we are determined to do what is necessary. Be part of that conversation; do not give in to the comfort of easy cynicism, peddled by those who say nothing has ever changed. They are wrong. The last 50 years proves that. For Ireland in Europe and for Europe in Ireland, I know the next 50 years will be a remarkable success story – because Ireland is Europe and Europe is Ireland. Thank you.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">Ceann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach, President Metsola, distinguished Members of the Dáil and Seanad, Irish MEPs and former Members of the Oireachtas, thar mo cheann féin agus thar ceann mo chomh-Theachtaí, cuirim fáilte ó chroí romhaibh. Ina cáil mar Uachtarán Pharlaimint na hEorpa, is ionadaí chroí daonlathach an Aontais Eorpaigh í. <i>Merba. Grazzi afna.</i></p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Ireland is marking 50 years of membership of the European Union this year. It has transformed our country and been a powerful engine for economic and social progress. Today, Ireland is a modern, prosperous and progressive country not only as a result of our own efforts, but because of the immense benefits we gained by joining the European Union. It gave us access to EU markets, to funding that helped us to develop our infrastructure and regions and to an agricultural policy through which we became a major food supplier to the world and which helped to sustain our thriving rural communities. Membership of the European Union has amplified our voice in the world. Today, the European Union is a significant global actor with regard to trade, foreign policy and development. It is also a vocal advocate for climate action. We engage with the world on the basis of our shared values, freedom, democracy and human rights, as well as on the basis of our shared interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> One of the most significant achievements of the European Union is the European Single Market, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It gave a great economic boost to the Republic of Ireland, unlocking our prosperity, but also removed border checks and restrictions on trade between North and South. Today, it is easy to take for granted the ability to trade, travel, work and study across the European Union without any barriers. You cannot see what is there any more. However, we need only look to the consequences of Brexit and its effects on the UK's young people to be reminded of how complicated life would be for our citizens and businesses were it not for the four freedoms of the European Single Market.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The European Union also provided a space in which peace on this island could be nurtured. It helped remove physical and mental barriers. Differences between North and South, and also between Britain and Ireland, melted away due to EU harmonisation. British and Irish politicians met as equals around the European table and we could more easily see how well aligned, rather than divided, we were on a great many matters, that we had a great deal in common and that there was more uniting us than dividing us. The European Parliament was a place where John Hume and Ian Paisley found common ground. I remember John Hume, that great European, saying how he was inspired by Strasbourg, where the European Parliament sits, in the Alsace region, which has switched between France and Germany throughout history. He asked why, if French and German people who spoke different languages and hurled them at each other through centuries of war could come together through common institutions, the two communities in Northern Ireland, who spoke the same language, could not do the same. The role of the European Parliament continues to this very day through the €1 billion PEACEPLUS programme, which we hope to finalise shortly. This will play a vital role in fostering peace and reconciliation in Ireland, particularly in the Border region. The fact that the President of the Parliament comes from the European Union's smallest member state and a fellow island state is deeply significant for us because we are a union of equals in which the voice of small states really does count.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> We meet at a time when peace is absent from our Continent. It has been almost a year since Russia launched its brutal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. We are proud to be part of a European Union that stands resolutely with the people of Ukraine. We will stand with them for as long as it takes. We pay tribute to the President's personal leadership and resolve. She was one of the first political leaders to visit Kyiv in an unambiguous demonstration of our commitment to Ukraine and an encouragement to that country on its European path. The European Union is built on strong foundations of shared values and a common purpose. It is rooted in freedom, democracy, the rule of law and a desire for peace. It continues to offer the hope of a better future to millions of fellow Europeans, from Ukraine to Moldova to the western Balkans, many of whom dream of joining the European Union. We should help to make that dream a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> As the President mentioned earlier, this week we celebrate St. Brigid's Day, Lá Fhéile Bríde, or Imbolc, the Celtic new year, which ushers in a new season of light, hope and growth. It reminds me of her inaugural speech to the European Parliament when she was elected President, in which she committed to standing up for the politics of hope and the promise of the European Union. We will always stand by her in that. Once again, the President is most welcome to Ireland. I thank her for addressing these Houses. Fáilte agus go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">Cuirim céad míle fáilte chuig an gcomhshuí speisialta seo de Dháil Éireann agus Sheanad Éireann roimh an Uachtarán Metsola. Is pribhléid agus onóir mhór dúinn go bhfuil sí anseo linn ag ceiliúradh 50 bliain de bhallraíocht na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach ón uair a chaith pobal na tíre seo vóta sa reifreann ar 10 Bealtaine 1972. Táimid fíorbhuíoch den Uachtarán as ucht a ceannaireachta san Eoraip, as a cuid oibre ar fad agus as an tacaíocht leanúnach a thugann sí don tír seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> It was my great honour to address the European Parliament last June. It was a special and moving occasion on which to reflect on our 50 years of membership of the European Union and also to celebrate the life and achievements of the great Irish parliamentarian, peacemaker and committed European, John Hume, whose bust we together unveiled.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Like the Parliament over which President Metsola presides, this Parliament stands in full solidarity with Ukraine. Russia's illegal and immoral aggression against its peaceful neighbour represents an horrific and violent assault. The impact on the Ukrainian people has been devastating and truly shocking. When I visited President Zelenskyy in Kyiv in July, I heard first-hand civilian accounts of the brutality and violence visited upon Ukrainian men, women and children by occupying Russian forces. The wanton destruction, including the targeting of nuclear facilities and other energy and civilian infrastructure, shows Putin's Russia behaving as a rogue state. The impact of this aggression has reached far beyond Ukraine. The energy crisis and its impact on the cost of living is as keenly felt in homes and businesses here in Ireland as it is in homes and businesses throughout the European Union. However, in the face of all of this, the support and solidarity of the Irish people has been truly inspirational. In the fact of this destruction and devastation, they have opened their communities, their homes and their hearts to more than 72,000 people who were forced to flee the war. We remain unswerving in our political support for Ukraine and in championing its path towards membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> In this Parliament, as in President Metsola's, we have loud debates which include a full range of opinions. However, let there be no doubt about where the Irish people stand with regard to the European Union and our own membership. The Eurobarometer report earlier this year showed that 71% of Irish citizens hold a positive view of the European Union. This is the highest figure recorded and significantly higher than the EU 27 average of 44%. It also found that 88% of Irish citizens were optimistic about the future of the European Union. However, we must never take this support for granted. We must continue to seek and embrace ways to engage citizens, especially our young people, on the aims and benefits of this great Union. We must continue to have a positive agenda of seeking ways to make our Union stronger and more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I thank President Metsola for her visit today, for her ongoing solidarity with Ireland and that of her Parliament in respect of Brexit and for her distinguished contribution in shaping the European Union's future. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">President Metsola is very welcome. This period of commemoration allows us to think big for a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">We have just celebrated our 100th year of the establishment of the State. In listening to President Metsola's words, I was thinking that it was founded on a real desire to stand on our own two feet as a nation, a strong sense of a nationalism, but that it was also imbued with an international perspective, an understanding from the start that our strength would only work within international law. Fifty years ago we learned the lesson that going it alone was not working and we wanted to join the European Union to take a further step in our prosperity, security and culture. We were lucky that the Union allowed us in - not lucky, we added to the Union, bringing neutrality, that still sense of not wanting to be militarily aligned. That was important to the time as something we brought and added to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> There is also what we gained. Strategic decisions at the time to invest in education, back our enterprise and go with the European institutions delivered fantastically for our country. President Metsola mentioned John Hume appropriately. We are approaching the 25-year anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and it is exactly the principle she mentioned, that coercion will not work in our desire for a united Ireland and that respect for diversity is a better way. We changed constitutionally and the vast majority of us voted significantly to take that approach. Now, 25 years on, we need to pause and consider where we are today and where we go for the next 25 and 50 years, recognising that our world is very insecure. Our security in Europe depends on the security of our neighbours in Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans, right the way around. We must recognise also that Europe is at risk. In our economy we are seeing a tendency to import all our software from the United States, all our hardware from Asia and all our energy from Russia and the Gulf. We need to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> President Metsola's address follows not that long after President von der Leyen addressed us. She said that she believes, and I believe the European Parliament thinks the same, that our future is in going green, the Green New Deal. There is the whole swathe of legislation the European Parliament has before it, the Fit for 55 package of legislative measures. I think there are 20 pieces of legislation that we are going to have to agree this year. That allows us to prepare for the future. It allows us to set the standard in aviation, maritime and digital policy where we need to get the constitutional rights of individuals stitched into the economic future. That is the key to success.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> It allows us restore nature. We have lost half of all wildlife in the last 50 years. Nature here, as across our Union, has been destroyed. Unless we address that, everything will be lost, all the foundations of our prosperity and security will be cut from underneath us. President Metsola's presence today is important and there is important work for us all to do. The constitutional, rule of law system we have is incredibly complicated if we try to explain it, even for those involved in the middle of it. It is this trialogue process where the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, the three legs of representative democratic institutions, have to work together. Let us do that. President Metsola's presence is an important moment at an important time when we have to do that legislative work to create the rule of laws that will provide for people's prosperity. I thank her and her colleagues from the European Parliament who are here today for the work they are doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_428"><i>Ben arrivata, Signora Presidente</i>. You are very welcome, Madam President. Ireland is a nation that stands proudly for the values of democracy, solidarity, equality and human dignity, for freedom. These are values shared and cherished by the peoples of Europe as we strive to shape a bright future for workers, families and communities in a rapidly changing world. They are of course the values that must drive, reform and recast the European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I warmly welcome President Metsola today. She visits us when our togetherness and common purpose have never been more important. A year on, Europe remains unified, Ireland also, in our support for the people of Ukraine against Putin's criminal and barbaric invasion. Russia's illegal war and violation of human rights must be stopped and the journey to peace must begin. Putin must withdraw. The Ukrainian people know that they are not alone. They know that Ireland and Europe will stand with them as they continue their struggle for the liberation of their beloved homeland.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Some 25 years ago, European solidarity was crucial in the success of our peace process and today Ireland is grateful for the unwavering support of our European partners in the face of Brexit. Europe has stood foursquare in defence of the protocol, hard-won protections for Ireland's peace, political stability and our all-Ireland economy. I acknowledge the repeated support of the European Parliament for the protocol and President Metsola's own staunch commitment, reiterated here today, to protect Ireland's interests in the midst of the Brexit storm. Sinn Féin supports the current talks between the European Union and Britain to make the protocol work better. We need pragmatic and durable solutions and we need them quickly. The people of the North of Ireland want stability and certainty. They want to see the Executive back up and running to deliver for them and their families under the leadership of our colleague, Ms Michelle O'Neill MLA, First Minister designate, who joins us today. We need to see an end to the DUP boycott of the political institutions in the North of Ireland. It has been reported that the mood music from the latest protocol talks is positive. That is most welcome. A fair and practical outcome to these negotiations must be delivered and the time for solutions is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> One of the surest ways of creating change in the world is by speaking honestly with our friends. It is time for the European Union and indeed the wider international community to act forcefully for peace in the Middle East, for an end to Israel's brutalisation of the Palestinians, for an end to the Israeli apartheid regime, a regime that sees annexation and illegal settlements, collective punishment, and the violent targeting of refugees and the dispossessed. In Israeli aggression, Palestinian reprisal, and innocent lives lost in Jenin refugee camp, in Gaza, in synagogues, we see the bitter fruit of the policies of a right-wing, hawkish government. President Metsola rightly reflected earlier on Ireland's colonial experience that shapes our world view. It is in that spirit that I say to her that it is wrong that Israel continues to enjoy a special partnership with the European Union while it tramples on the human rights of Palestinians----</p>

If the European Union is a Union of values, of peace, then the EU must be to the fore in forming a global movement against Israeli apartheid in Palestine with the same international determination and momentum that defeated apartheid in South Africa three decades ago. Tá a fhios againn nuair a oibríonn muid le náisiúin an Aontais Eorpaigh go bhfuilimid chomh láidir agus is féidir.

          <p eId="para_435"> President Metsola visits at a time of great change in our country. Ireland has always had the support of our gallant allies in Europe. Europe has kept faith with Ireland and that friendship has meant so very much. We have now had 25 years of peace but we have more to do. Our country remains partitioned but as we walk the final length of our long journey to full nationhood and reunification, I ask our European partners to continue to walk with us. I for one look forward to the day when we see Ireland, our country, in the European Union as a nation united, looking confidently with our European friends to a better future for all our people.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">Ar son Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre cuirim fáilte mhór roimh an Uachtaráin Metsola go dtí Tithe an Oireachtais. President Metsola is welcome. As Ireland marks 50 years of membership of the European Union, we remember the economic and social progress we have made together but we also recall the hard lessons, particularly from during the economic crash, when serious mistakes were made by the EU and the European Central Bank, ECB, which we felt here. Thankfully, more recently the positive principles of solidarity and collective action have been central to the European response to the Covid-19 pandemic and Putin’s brutal war on Ukraine. What those crises have shown is the critical importance of the role of the state and the fact that over-reliance on the market will not solve the complex problems we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Two immediate and pressing challenges that require a strong European response are the war in Ukraine and the climate catastrophe. First, since Russia's brutal invasion a year ago, we have seen nearly 5 million refugees flee Ukraine. Across the EU we have seen countries acting generously in response. Other wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, combined with the impact of climate change, have led to more people seeking international protection, both here and in other European countries. What we need to see in response is a collective approach at European level to migration policy, one that recognises the benefits of inward migration to our Continent, supports countries in meeting their international obligations and shows what we call céad míle fáilte to those who come here seeking refuge.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> As we see today, the historic meeting of EU Commissioners in Kyiv is showing welcome solidarity and practical support for Ukraine in terms of accession to the EU, in its rebuilding effort and in seeking to win the war. At that level, I urge that, as part of that solidarity message, we see the introduction of an EU-wide cohesion and integration fund, ring-fenced for supporting countries and communities that are offering a welcome and supports to those fleeing war and persecution. Such a financial programme would have a positive benefit, recognising that people and communities need support for integration.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Second, the climate crisis is an existential threat for all of us and we support President von der Leyen's strong leadership on a new green deal at EU level. However, we need to see more accelerated and urgent action. Debates over the proposed energy performance of buildings directive show we still have some way to go, with conservative groupings seeking less ambitious retrofit targets. We also need to see the EU do more to acknowledge the role of air transport in climate change. Like President Metsola's home country of Malta, we too are an island but we have to acknowledge that it is incomprehensible that aviation fuel is not taxed for its carbon emissions. We should see action on this at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> As the Labour Party is a member of the second largest grouping in the European Parliament, the Party of European Socialists, PES, we look forward to working le chéile san Eoraip with our sister parties to achieve a more equal Europe, our vision of a social democratic future for all the peoples of our European Continent.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">President Metsola is welcome to the joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas. As the Tánaiste said, the Eurobarometer poll earlier this year revealed that 71% of Irish citizens have a positive image of the EU, the highest rating among the member states. If anything, the fallout from Brexit has boosted those favourable views both here and across the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I acknowledge the staunch support of our EU partners for the Good Friday Agreement and the clear commitment that there will never be a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. We remain hopeful that a fair compromise is imminent on the Northern Ireland protocol. What is important is that when a deal comes the Good Friday Agreement, which has protected peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland since it was agreed almost 25 years ago, is defended and respected. We want to see the functioning institutions restored in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> While there is undoubtedly an overwhelmingly positive attitude to the EU in Ireland, there are also concerns about certain policy choices. The EU should be about the social Europe first and the economic Europe second. The fiscal rules, for example, need reform. One size does not fit all. For example, Ireland needs the freedom to deal with infrastructural deficits, climate change and our housing crisis, while maintaining fiscal stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I also want to raise the prosecution of an Irishman, Seán Binder, in Greece for the alleged crime of plucking drowning migrants from the sea. In January, some of the charges against Seán and other humanitarian workers were dropped but felony charges, including for people smuggling, remain. Such prosecutions are an attack on the core values of the EU, including human dignity, equality, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Another attack on the EU institutions is on trust in the EU by way of corruption, to which President Metsola alluded. Allegations that countries such as Qatar and Morocco have bought influence at the highest political level of the European Parliament were deeply shocking. The European Parliament has so far dealt with this scandal firmly and has lifted diplomatic immunity so that MEPs can be criminally investigated. Corruption, if it is found to exist, will rot the institutions from the inside out and must be excised from the roots. When the criminal investigation is over and if allegations against MEPs and lobbyists are proven, a serious review of existing anti-corruption measures in the EU institutions will be required. I am sure President Metsola will have the full support of this country for any such review. I also reiterate our full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and condemn the brutal invasion of a sovereign state.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I welcome President Metsola to Dublin and Ireland. I welcome her commitment to supporting continued peace on this island and to preventing any return to a hard border in this country. I also welcome her comments about the need to address the cost-of-living and housing crises that are gripping Europe and significantly impacting this country. I have to say, however, that it is long past time the European institutions acknowledged the role they played, particularly in response to the economic crisis after 2008 and the decision of the Troika to impose swingeing, cruel and brutal austerity in this country. That is not an historical matter and it has left us with a dire and cruel housing crisis that is inflicting utter misery on record numbers of people in homeless accommodation and tens of thousands of people who are affected by the lack of affordable and public housing. Europe has a great responsibility for the decisions it made in that regard, which also affected the crisis that continues to grip our health service as we were forced to cull thousands of health workers. That has left us a grim legacy in our health services, which are overrun.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> I also want to question the assertion President Metsola made about "a superpower of values" and principles. She rightly condemns Vladimir Putin's brutal and invasion of and inexcusable and criminal warmongering in Ukraine, but fails at the same time to condemn the crimes against humanity and the apartheid system that Israel is perpetrating against the Palestinian people, as was recently publicised by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. When she went to the Knesset in May last year she did not say a word about the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and did not condemn the apartheid regime. The European Union does not call for sanctions in the way it has called for them against Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">It is does not assert the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's right to resist an illegal occupation of their land and territory and the criminal apartheid regime that is imposed on them. Those double standards cannot stand. That is not a superpower of principles but one of double standards. Ms Metsola will know that six MEPs from the parliament of which she is president were denied access to go in to monitor the crimes of Israel against the Palestinian people. The humans rights organisations in Palestine wrote to her asking her to speak out against that, which she has failed to do. We need consistency and real principles when it comes to these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">Ar mo shon féin agus mo chairde sa Ghrúpa Réigiúnach, cuirim fáilte roimh an Uachtarán. Tá súil againn go mbeidh an t-am a chaitheann sí anseo ina chabhair agus ina ábhar eolais di. Tá súil againn freisin go mbainfidh sí taitneamh as a cuairt go hÉirinn inniu. It is a remarkable feature of our politics that I have the opportunity to address the President of the EU Parliament on the occasion of Ireland's 50th year at the heart of the European project. Three years ago, I entered politics principally out of frustration at the lack of a 24-7 emergency cardiac service for County Waterford and, more generally, unequal access to healthcare and education in the region. Everyone in the room will appreciate how swiftly I worked in my parish concerns there.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The warm welcome offered to the president today needs to be compared to the contested ground of the céad míle fáilte that Ireland currently musters for refugees. Irish people know that migration is a long term and often forever entanglement. The kindness and decency of the welcome matters. There can be no second-class citizens in a republic, even in our flawed Republic. Yet, we are now at risk of emulating the cold house of our English neighbours offered to Irish labourers in the 1950s, or the sentiment there delivering unconscionable treatment to the Windrush generation, in addition to their explicitly hostile environment for migrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Irish people value a warm welcome but the ability of our politics and that of the EU to deliver one is now an open question. Ireland can certainly afford a dignified reception. This week's GDP numbers show that the calibre of the welcome relates to the Government's capability rather than resources. The EU can also afford a warm house and a warm welcome. Ms Metsola, in her address on her election as president, affirmed a commitment to European values of dignity, solidarity and fundamental rights. Will our politics and governance allow us to live these values? Are we capable of ensuring that no more people meet the same fate as Alan Kurdi in the Mediterranean? It is profoundly a question of capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Realistically, in Ireland, it is a question of solving the housing crisis and the broader challenge of raising the capacity and the quality of government services. Our politics is tired and weary from permanent polycrises, including the bailout, the pandemic, housing, health and the energy crisis. The cost of failure to deliver is that we allow our values slip. If that happens, we will be diminished as a people. We will be known not for our welcome but our inability to welcome those who throw in their lot with ours.</p>

A trail of terror has been blazed by vulture funds and the banks in this country on ordinary householders and small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> We also have the situation regarding the Paris Agreement green deal of 2015, which is outdated at this stage. It is a goal we cannot continue with because it is putting penury and misery on ordinary people. We see countries such as China, India and Germany opening dirty coal mines at the moment, while we are taking all these measures at the behest of this agreement. I am not against climate change.

						</b>-----if that is possible. We have sniggers and insults across the floor. It is disgusting behaviour that has crept in from those who will not tolerate anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> A situation is also being forced on us in respect of the refugee crisis. We are "Ireland of the thousand welcomes", of course, but the problem is the management of that welcome and of inward migration, and the undocumented people who have arrived here. There is a lack of both information and a cohesive plan. We saw it in Lismore this week and it could be in the town of Cahir, where I live, next week, where rumour emerges. I have spoken about it to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who is doing his best, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. We need planning. We do not have the hospital services, again thanks to the troika and the banking collapse. We do not have the teaching capability or the services in place. We are foisting people on communities with no information, no proper truth and no proper debate. That is not a good situation. We want to welcome. We want to be able to say, "Ní neart go cur le chéile", as the Ceann Comhairle said, but we want to do so positively and together. We want to be able to debate the policy in this House. We have not had that debate for the past year. We will have statements next week, thankfully, when we will have some modicum of debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> All is not well in our little country. Europe has been good to us. We are celebrating 50 years in the EU but its policies are affecting the sale of portions of Coillte. European rules will not allow Coillte to avail of grants. This must be re-examined. The policies are too rigid to allow our economy to thrive. For our people to survive and be the vibrant people they are, we need better understanding from Europe for us.</p>

As a former MEP, I remember her when she was also an MEP, in particular in her role as vice chair of the petitions committee, where many petitioners from across Europe, including Ireland, came to make their case. I remember her humane approach and consideration, which was appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> However, we did not always agree politically. As a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, which is now the Renew Europe group, I remember we were sometimes on different sides of the argument. In a way, I see that as part of the strength of the European Parliament in that there is no in-built majority. Many majorities are constructed around specific issues and legislation. That allows MEPs from groups, large and small, to influence outcomes through compromise amendments at committee and plenary sessions. That strengthens the legitimacy of the democratic workings of the Parliament and helps to ensure that diverse voices can be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I commend the European Parliament on its steadfast support for Ireland throughout the entire Brexit process and its support for Ukraine as Russia targets its citizens and homeland. I agree with the President that the parliament is most certainly not without its failings. Her challenge is to minimise those, strengthen links to citizens and rebuild trust. As we celebrate 50 years of membership of the EU, I wish her well.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">It is interesting that another president of Europe is present today, although President Metsola represents the European Parliament. The most recent president we were blessed with was the President of the Commission where, arguably, all the power lies, the members of which are all unelected bureaucrats. Not to be undone, and to give the impression that the EU is a democratic organisation, a democratically elected member of the parliament is present today.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The purpose of today's visit is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of our membership of the EU. It would be nice to have Europeans here thanking us for our total contribution of fish to the EU, which far outweighs any help in terms of the value of moneys we have received from Europe since we joined. Acknowledging that we have been hoodwinked over the years, even to this day, when France, Spain, Belgium and a host of other EU countries have more entitlement to our fish stocks than we have, would be welcome and would at least make us believe that the EU is interested in what we have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Of course, the EU has always had plenty of our ruling parties to help it along the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">We are guilty of assisting in our own denigration unfortunately. Our ruling parties are going to happily get rid of our neutrality in the coming years and we will become an integral part of the European empire. I wonder what the European Parliament has to say about that but then the European Parliament will not have a role in defence. That will be left totally to the unelected Commission which is only required to inform the Parliament that it is going to war.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> It is also interesting that President Metsola is from another neutral member state of the Union. I hope it is not in name only. Does the Government of Malta carry on in the same way as the Irish Government and happily undermine neutrality at every opportunity? Perhaps the Maltese Government has more backbone and will defend what its citizens believe.</p>

          <p eId="para_472"><i>Merba ila Irlanda</i>. Merba ila Dublin. I speak as an Independent Senator representing the graduates of Trinity College Dublin. I also speak as a veteran of Ireland's Armed Forces and a veteran of conflict in the Middle East, a person who has witnessed at first hand the squalor and indiscriminate savagery of war in the Middle East. War such as that in Ukraine today kills innocent men and women and murders children. I commend the support our European Union has given to Ukraine, including the moral support, financial support and, yes, the supply of weapons and armaments that Ukraine may defend itself against Vladimir Putin's aggression. Today I make this plea to President Metsola, as a veteran and a parent of teenagers and young adults, please, we need to invest as much energy in ending this war as we do in tanks, air defence systems, fighter aircraft or longer range missiles.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Putin and his henchmen-and henchwomen have shown a complete disregard for the international laws of conflict. Putin has shown complete disregard for logic and a complete disregard for human life. Tens of thousands of young Ukrainian soldiers and thousands of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children have been sacrificed on the altar of his fragile ego and brittle patriarchal ambition as have tens of thousands of young Russian men from the poorest republics in the Russian Federation. And for what? A vanity project at the behest of the world's richest oligarchs. As spring approaches we risk escalation in this war. I have no doubt that Putin and his newly appointed General Gerasimov, architect of the infamous Gerasimov doctrine, is capable of deploying a so-called tactical nuclear weapon, or mini nuke, in Ukraine. That would signal the beginning of a wider and cataclysmic conflict. There is a saying in Russian, and there is also a saying in Ireland when people ask for directions, "I would not start here" but here we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> The direction I ask from President Metsola and from the European Parliament is to find the pathway to peace, to leave no stone unturned and to bring an end and a just resolution to the war. The most powerful weapon we can give Ukraine in this conflict is full membership of our European Union. We need to accelerate this because our values and prosperity represent the most powerful challenge to tyranny. Putin and his cronies will not be here forever. Ukraine will. Likewise will the European Union and the people of Russia. Let us find a pathway to peace through our European Union. It is not a military union but a social and economic union. Let us not forget it is the greatest peace process in human history and long may it continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">On behalf of the Civil Engagement Group I welcome President Metsola to the Oireachtas for the important discussions we are having to mark Ireland's 50 years of participation in the collective project that is the European Union. One of the reasons for the positive views of so many members of the Irish public towards that project has been the role that the European Union has historically played in supporting progress on environmental protection, workers' rights and gender equality, from the ending of the marriage bar and the introduction of the working time directive to the important affirmation of women's access to bodily autonomy, safety and reproduction rights, which are also reflected in our recent referendum, and the very welcome European Parliament vote today in favour of a strong directive on the rights of platform workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We cannot be complacent on either values or rights as they can be eroded as well as progressed. When it comes to the crucial issue of migrant rights the European Parliament has had moments of leadership, voting for the activation of the temporary protection directive for Ukrainians and a noble attempt to activate that protective directive in respect of Syrian refugees in 2015. There have been moments of retreat from rights, in the shameful failure to support search and rescue in the Mediterranean and the funding of walls with Syria.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> President Metsola spoke about real peace and it is very important. Europe is a peace project. It is not just security. Sometimes security and peace work in different directions. Real peace comes from longer and deeper work and investment in communities and cohesion. There are the particular contributions of neutral countries such as Malta and Ireland in the important international work of disarmament, which contribute to all of our security and peace in this world, and in the application and championing of international law wherever it is breached.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> It is extremely welcome that European countries have been strong and clear in their support of international law, human rights and humanitarian support for Ukraine but clear and strong positions are also needed elsewhere. The EU should not be allowing, let alone defending in the courts, trade in goods from occupied territories, be they in Palestine or Western Sahara. The targeting of front-line human rights defenders, journalists or civilians, and I know these are issues President Metsola cares about, are issues wherever they occur, including, as we have seen recently, in the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> President Metsola spoke about healthcare. When we talk of EU values if they are really values we should be wishing them for everyone. Values such as healthcare are important. The European Parliament took a position in support of a TRIPS waiver. This was important because it was an example of how parliamentarians can reflect the decency and solidarity of citizens rather than prioritising the profits of a few companies. It is to be hoped this will be reflected in the corporate sustainability due diligence directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I am coming to the end of my time. I was to speak on the future of Europe and I know President Metsola has a record in a former future of Europe process. The Parliament can speak to institutions and remind them that our mandate comes from the public of Europe; not from lobbyists or small interests but from the public. We can avoid the mistakes of austerity and build a Europe that genuinely cares and is social.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">Mar an cainteoir deireanach, ar son Bhaill Dháil Éireann agus Sheanad Éireann, gabhaim míle buíochas leis an Uachtarán as ucht na hóráide iontaí inniu agus as an gcairdeas agus tacaíocht a thugann sí féin agus baill Pharlaimint na hEorpa don Rialtas agus do phobal na hÉireann. Members of Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann, it is my pleasure to welcome President Metsola and thank her for her support and friendship to us as a democracy and a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> The European Parliament represents the second largest electorate in the world. The people of Ireland value being part of that electorate. For 50 years since 1973, 50 bliain ag fás, we have benefited from economic and developmental opportunities. More than this, our membership of the European Union enables us to stand with the hundreds of millions of Europeans who share our commitment to democracy and peace. President Metsola, today your address was both honest, challenging and sobering and we thank you for that. Tá seanfhocal sa Gaeilge agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an ceann céanna sa Mháltais. There is a saying in Irish, and I think a very similar one in your own language: Tagann an ghrian i ndiaidh na fearthainne - the sun follows after the rain. These are challenging times, as many of our speakers today have said, in our region and they demand a strong European Union. As President of the European Parliament you have shown your commitment to lead, renew and strengthen Europe in preparation for brighter days ahead. We thank you for your leadership, your presence and your visit to us today, which we see as a sign of Europe’s continued commitment to Ireland as well as Ireland’s continued commitment to Europe, as you have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> Your visit comes, as we spoke of at lunch, after an ancient Gaelic festival called Imbolc. For Christians, it is the feast day of St. Brigid and traditionally observed on the first day of February. Imbolc marks the beginning of spring, a time of renewal and a time of hope. I mention this today as a reminder to all of us that Europe, as a project of peace, has hope at its centre. In your role as President of the European Parliament you have been an agent of that hope. Your presidency has been simultaneous with the unjust war in Ukraine and you have met this challenge by demonstrating that Europe's strength lies in solidarity and unity. Ireland is proud to be represented in the European Parliament that is a beacon of hope for Ukraine and a driver of positive change in Europe and the world. I welcome today to our joint sitting members of the European Parliament who are here. I see former Senator, Deputy and Minister, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, Maria Walsh MEP, Deirdre Clune MEP and former MEP Gay Mitchell. You are very welcome. I want to welcome Michelle O'Neill to our sitting today and thank her for your leadership as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> A Uachtaráin, thank you for being here today. You went to Kyiv at a time when leadership was needed. You have demonstrated again that you are preparing for that brighter day. We wish you a very positive visit to our country. We thank you for your support. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
