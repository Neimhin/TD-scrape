            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Billy Kelleher</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> when the waiting lists and waiting times for inpatient and day case scheduled admissions will improve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [2647/15]</p>

            <p eId="para_2">When does the Minister envisage an improvement in waiting lists and waiting times for inpatient and day case scheduled admissions? The most recent figures are for October 2014, but the Minister may have more recent ones. At the time 59,463 were on inpatient day case lists, of whom 54,250 were adults and 5,205 were children. Those on the lists, who require some service from the health service, have been waiting an inordinate length of time. Things are moving in the wrong direction. Even though there has been an increase in funding for acute hospitals, when does the Minister envisage a decrease in waiting times?</p>

            <p eId="para_3">Improving waiting lists for inpatient and day case treatment is a key priority for me and the Government. My Department is working with the HSE to put in place a plan to eliminate very long waiters by the end of the year. This will involve productivity improvement and rigorous waiting list management. Further increasing day case surgery rates for specific procedures will be important in improving elective access within available capacity. Priority will be given to adherence to the guidelines on the scheduling of patients for surgery, including chronological scheduling, which will be vigorously monitored by the HSE throughout the year. </p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The management of competing demands for emergency and scheduled care requires changes in how and where patients are treated. The movement of care and treatment from inpatient to day case and from day case to outpatients is most important, as is ensuring the appropriate ratio of new to return appointments, which reduces unnecessary return appointments. Limiting elective surgery in preparation for, or as a response to, increased emergency department attendances is intended to help to manage the need for immediate emergency or trauma care. </p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Where it is necessary to prioritise cancer and other complex cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done. This inevitably will affect waiting lists. The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively, within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals. As I have stated publicly in the context of the significant emergency pressures being experienced by hospitals, realistically I do not envisage significant improvement in elective waiting times in the early part of the year. However, based on the high priority attached to this area in the HSE service plan and the first overall increase in the HSE budget in seven years, it is expected that improvement will occur later in the year. </p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">The previous Minister for Health, now Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, said, "For people and patients, a key barometer of the success of our reform programme must be the performance of emergency departments and waiting lists." I cannot blame the Minister for Health for the previous Minister's failings, but I cannot absolve him because of the fact that he is a member of the Government which put a fierce emphasis on the pretence that it would address all of these issues. We are facing into the fifth year of the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government and things have got progressively worse. Even though the Minister changed the criteria for counting those on waiting lists and the time people were waiting, things are still getting progressively worse. The idea that the solution to overcrowding in emergency departments is the cancellation of elective surgery beggars belief. This is creating a major difficulty for individuals in terms of being told their elective surgery has been cancelled and that they are back on waiting lists. If we could have clarity on what the Minister intends to do about this, we would appreciate it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">It is important to point out that all waiting lists are not the same. There are different waiting lists for different procedures, surgery, outpatient appointments, scans and other investigations. There are different waiting lists in different hospitals and for different consultants. Not all waiting lists are increasing; some are decreasing. For example, the waiting lists for physiotherapy and occupational therapy in the community are decreasing and there are very short wait times, if any, for palliative care. It is the case that the waiting lists for hospital-based investigations, procedures and appointments are rising. The figures for November which will be released tomorrow will show that they are rising and they will continue to rise for a number of months, not least because we have had to cancel so many elective surgeries this month. I agree that it is not a solution, but it is a necessary response to the overcrowding we are facing in emergency departments. We are doing three things. These involve transparency, greater efficiency around waiting lists such as adherence to chronological order, more new patients, fewer returns and other such things, and specific initiatives. Some 20,000 more day cases will be dealt with in 2015 as a result of the increase in the budget and there are specific initiatives in the case of scoliosis, endoscopy, ophthalmic services for children and orthodontics. We will see the impact of this but not until later in the year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">We welcome any commitment that there will be an improvement, but we would like to see an improvement in how we manage waiting lists. More importantly, we would like to see resources being put in place to streamline the assessment of patients and the lists on which they should be placed. What confounds people is the idea that we are consistently cancelling elective surgery in order to deal with crises in emergency departments. The idea that we put people on a waiting list while knowing that there is a chance that elective surgeries will be cancelled in January is something we need to examine. That policy exerts major stress and pressure on the many people preparing for operations throughout the Christmas period and in January who are then told that the response to the continuous emergency overcrowding in January is the cancellation of elective surgery. This has caused great distress for many, as the Minister knows from his other profession. People have major concerns when they are waiting for operations and procedures and that they are being cancelled as an emergency response is not good enough.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">It is important to point out that roughly 80% of people are seen within the target time. We tend to focus on those for whom the target is not met. While non-urgent elective surgery is being cancelled, out-patient surgery is not and in most cases day surgery and investigations such as scopes, for example, are not being cancelled. It is not the case that everything is being cancelled or anything like that.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> It is the case that emergency departments are much busier at this time of year every winter. What it might make sense to do would be to smooth out activities in hospitals so we do not plan as many elective procedures in January and instead plan to carry out more in the summer. At the moment, the surge happens in January and elective surgery is deferred but then wards are closed in the summer. It might make more sense from now on to plan to do fewer elective procedures in January and February and during the summer to keep the wards open and to do more elective procedures at that time. This would be a way of smoothing out the activity in hospitals. I am sure if it was that simple it would have been done long ago but it may be something that at the least may need to be attempted.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">The Government regards trolley waiting times of more than nine hours as being unacceptable and it acknowledges the difficulties which the current surge in emergency department activity is causing for patients, their families and the staff who are doing their utmost to provide safe quality care in very challenging circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, the re-opening of closed beds, the provision of additional diagnostic scans and additional ward rounds being undertaken by consultants in order to improve the appropriate flow of patients through hospitals. </p>
            <p eId="para_15"> The Government has provided additional funding of €3 million in 2014 and €25 million in 2015, to address delayed discharges. Actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional fair deal places and an extension of the community intervention teams. Where it is necessary to prioritise emergency and trauma surgery, cancer and complex non-urgent cases, the HSE assures me that this is being done. Inevitably, this will affect waiting lists and waiting times. The challenge is to minimise the need for cancellation at short notice and to manage the impact of such cancellations effectively within the hospital and in collaboration with other hospitals. As I have mentioned it may be necessary to increase elective activity over the summer period.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Last month I convened the emergency department task force in order to develop long-term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waiting times. My Department and the HSE are currently working together on a plan which will ensure that trolley waiting times are contained throughout the year, that operational arrangements in acute hospitals and across acute and community care are designed and implemented consistently so as to contribute to sustainable improvement in the future and to the provision of a strong basis on which to evaluate and manage performance.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">While some of the steps outlined by the Minister in his response are indeed required, nevertheless he has not indicated in his reply the importance of providing adequate staffing. I did not note it in the reply he has read into the record of the House. It is very important to recognise that the crisis that has presented in recent weeks across our acute hospital network, is continuing. I have noted that the INMO trolley watch yesterday indicated 431 people on trolleys. There is a continuing suspension of elective day case surgery at a number of sites, including at the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk, where the staffing resources at that hospital are being redeployed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, in order to prioritise urgent patient care and surgery there. This decision is to be reviewed on a weekly basis. That problem is continuing and I have provided one example.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I refer to the situation of the impending work to rule which no one wants to see happen. The nurses do not want to take these decisions. It is critical that appropriate steps are taken to recognise the complexity of the situation and the need for all elements to be progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> In conclusion, we discussed the matter in the Joint Committee on Health and Children last Thursday when the Minister and the director general of the HSE came before us. We did not on that occasion have the information that was revealed yesterday by the Minister's colleague regarding an expected further difficulty because of the exodus of some 1,000 nurses between now and June. I ask the Minister to outline to the House exactly what action he is taking to address the chronic shortage of nurses, both in terms of acute hospitals and the needs of the psychiatric hospitals.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">Adequate staffing levels are a given; I do not think it should have to be stated. The Deputy may be interested in some of the facts. We have more consultants than ever before and if we can achieve agreement with the IMO on the new consultant scales we will be able to regularise and advertise for quite a number of posts in the next couple of weeks, although, inevitably, such posts will take a few months to fill. We have significantly more midwives than previously, with an increase in numbers, from 900 or so, a few years ago, to close to 1,500 now. This increase is along with a falling birth rate in recent years. In the past year the number of nurses employed by the HSE increased by 500. It is true that the number has reduced by 4,500 from a number of years ago but I refer the Deputy to the extra hour worked by nurses, the graduate nursing programme and the extra 500 nurses employed last year. We are starting to go in the right direction again. Approximately 32,000 to 34,000 nurses are in the system while 1,000 retirements is equivalent to 3% of the workforce. It is not unusual to have a 3% turnover in a workforce in any given year. In the most recent recruitment campaign by the HSE more than 4,000 nurses applied for positions. However, we are not complacent - I note the particular issue in mental health care as the Deputy mentioned - and active workforce planning will be necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">While the Minister made reference to increased bed numbers, it is very important to understand that this cannot be achieved with a static complement of nursing staff. It is very important that the crisis we have recently witnessed and which continues, is addressed holistically in the round. It cannot be done simply by the introduction of additional beds on wards. If the same complement of nurses remains, then not only patient care will be impacted; despite the best efforts of the heroic nursing staff, the truth and the bottom line is that patient safety can also be compromised. It is hugely important that we have adequate nursing staff recruited. We have to recognise and realise that there are competing locations for our highly qualified new, young nursing graduates. It is very important that every effort is employed to make the opportunity and the contract here as attractive as possible. As I said earlier, it is not just a case of monetary return, but also there is the importance of career path development. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, very rightly highlighted this situation that in the coming months will compound the problem we have been discussing. What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that existing staff are retained? What further steps is he taking in order to ensure that not only applications are received but that actual recruitment is the result? On the back of the situation regarding the flu vaccine revelations last Thursday, what steps are now being taken to ensure if it is at all possible that all hospital staff - despite the fact that the flu vaccine is not of the exact match for the flu virus presenting - and all staff across our hospital sites are vaccinated in order to help avoid any loss of service due to contracting the flu virus? Is there a situation now in hand or planned?</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I am not sure what the Deputy means by revelations with regard to the influenza vaccine. The vaccine used in Ireland is the same as is used all around the world and as recommended by the World Health Organisation. The reason we have to be vaccinated against the flu every year is because the virus changes and mutates every year. It is the case that this year the vaccine only has about 25% to 30% coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> It is the responsibility of infection control and occupational health units in every hospital to ensure that staff are vaccinated. Individuals also have a personal responsibility in this regard and the vaccine is available to staff free of charge. The other advice we are giving to people revolves around infection control, whereby we are encouraging them to "catch it, bin it, kill it". In addition, GPs are being advised to prescribe Tamiflu antivirals to the members of high-risk groups in order to reduce the duration of the illness.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">3. <b>Deputy Joan Collins</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> his views on waiting lists at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin, in respect of knee replacement surgery; if he will provide a breakdown of the length of time patients are waiting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_29">I tabled this question because Cappagh Hospital has come onto my radar on a number of occasions - I am sure the position is the same with other Members present - in the context of waiting times relating to knee and hip surgical procedures. There have been reports to the effect that operating theatres at the hospital are sitting idle because the authorities there do not have the resources available to allow procedures to be carried out in them. Question No. 27 in my name relates to an elderly and very ill woman in my area who has already been to St. James's Hospital and who has been informed that it will be almost 15 months before she will be operated upon. This is a serious matter. What is happening is not acceptable and I do not believe the Minister would stand over it. Will he indicate what is being done in the context of reducing waiting times?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_18" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_30">There are currently 686 patients waiting for knee replacement surgery at Cappagh Hospital. Some 15% of these patients, approximately 100, have been waiting between nine and 12 months and 12%, in the region of 70, have been waiting for more than a year. I met representatives from the hospital late last year to discuss the challenges it faces. In 2014, there was an increase of approximately 40% in the number of overall patient referrals. This increase in demand, coupled with a reduced budget, cessation of National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, funding, and a reduction in private income limited the availability of suitably qualified staff and this led to a reduction in surgical capability at the hospital and an increase in waiting lists. The HSE has been engaging with Cappagh Hospital on an ongoing basis in order to identity potential initiatives that would allow for a reduction in waiting times for patients for surgery. Further funding was provided in late 2014 which allowed the hospital to undertake additional workloads.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> I am happy to inform the Deputy that the HSE has also provided Cappagh Hospital with additional resources - in the form of an expanded budget - for 2015 to allow for an increase in inpatient procedures. The 2015 budget allocation process has enabled the opening of closed and under-utilised capacity at Cappagh Hospital. This will enable the opening of an additional 1.5 theatres per day - bringing the total number in use to four - and will allow the authorities at the hospital to increase activity levels. The hospital will target this new capacity to significantly address its current waiting list breach volumes. The HSE will continue to engage with the hospital to explore mechanisms to ensure optimal use of resources, including theatre capacity, at the hospital within the overall resources available to the acute sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Minister for his reply. I am sure people who are awaiting hip and knee surgery will welcome additional resources being made available. This matter comes down to the number of nurses and consultants available to carry out procedures. If sufficient staff are available, this ensures that referrals can be made and admissions facilitated as quickly as possible. It is a terrible tragedy that consultants are informing patients that they should contact their local Deputies for assistance if they are having difficulty in the context of waiting lists. That should not be the case. The HSE should be able to identify where problems exist and then, as the Minister indicated, it should be in a position to try to address them by putting the necessary resources in place. I welcome the fact that the latter is now happening. Steps should be taken to ensure that waiting lists are checked every two months in order to gauge the level of movement relating to them.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_20" as="#Minister_for_Health">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">Waiting lists are checked every month or two months and are validated every three months. As a result of the modest increase in the budget for 2015, capacity and workload at Cappagh Hospital will increase and more procedures will be carried out there. Of course, demand is also increasing. It is my hope and expectation that - on foot of the expanded budget - activity will increase faster than demand. However, I cannot say that this will happen for certain and we will not know the exact position until later in the year. While what I have outlined will allow the hospital to open four operating theatres every day, there is still unused capacity there. If I had additional moneys available - I do not - we would be able to do even more. Like every other country, Ireland is obliged to operate its health service within budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> One of the advantages for Cappagh Hospital is that it does not have an accident and emergency department and is not, therefore, obliged to restrict surgery when surges occur. This must be borne in mind when discussing the reconfiguration of accident and emergency departments at hospitals throughout the country. More elective work can be done at hospitals which are not obliged to deal with unpredictable surges at accident and emergency departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I thank the Deputy for tabling this question. Like others, I was shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable adults at Áras Attracta. Every person who uses our disability services - as the Deputy is aware and as I have stated regularly - deserves not just the best standard of care but also to be treated with respect and dignity. The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the director general of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> In December, the HSE initiated an expert investigation, chaired by Mr. Christy Lynch, and an independently-chaired review, led by Dr. Kevin McCoy, of services at the facility. Mr Lynch's investigation team is working independently of the HSE and its findings will facilitate any disciplinary process the HSE may undertake. I welcome the fact that the Garda has cleared the way to allow Mr. Lynch's investigation to commence. I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress. Dr. McCoy is undertaking an assurance review of the services at Áras Attracta and his final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex. The review will identify system-wide learning, involving engagement with relevant experts as well as input from staff. The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. These initiatives include the establishment of a national implementation task force, including a series of national summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and culture; implementation of the national policy and procedures on safeguarding vulnerable persons at risk of abuse; development of an advocacy service, which is vitally important; implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres; development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services at Áras Attracta, when complete; and development of long-term, sustainable and evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">On Tuesday, 9 December, Mr. Tony O'Brien, the HSE's director general, confirmed on "Prime Time" that he would roll out undercover inspections at facilities like Áras Attracta and was to consider the introduction of CCTV.

We have employed consultants to advise us. We have not rolled back from the commitment or from ensuring that, when the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is not present - I believe that HIQA would never have found this instance - we will be able to put in place a mechanism that is not easily obscured or doctored in any way. I stated what I did last week because we are not experts in this technology. We must ensure that vulnerable people in particular rather than all settings are protected on an ongoing basis.</p>

We have had little time since early December to discuss it with respect to Áras Attracta. I welcome the Minister's initiation of an investigation, but I am concerned that the person leading it has business interests that are dependent on the HSE. In terms of issues like fair procedure, due process and independence, is it appropriate that the person leading the investigation is financially linked to the HSE in his domestic circumstances? It is where he earns his money. The HSE and an agent of the HSE is investigating the HSE.</p>

The job he does for the Government is second to none. It is we who owe him, not the other way around. We may pay for the service that he provides, but it is an excellent one.

            <p eId="para_50">This question relates to the problem in recent weeks of the large number of people on accident and emergency beds. People who need care in the community, be it hospice care, public nursing home care or home care, remain in acute hospital beds because they cannot access those outlets. No one who does not need to be in hospital should be there. People should be where they are most comfortable.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Deputy for her question. Delayed discharges arise when a patient has been judged clinically to no longer have a requirement for acute hospital care but remains in an acute hospital bed, thus rendering that bed unavailable for patients who need admission. In budget 2015, the Government allocated €25 million to tackle the problem of delayed discharges. This additional funding is being applied across residential and community services to reflect the varying needs of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Of the €25 million, €10 million has been allocated to the nursing homes support scheme, resulting in 300 extra approvals and a shortening in the waiting time for approval from 17 weeks to 11 weeks. Some 145 approvals were in acute hospitals and 107 were for long-term residential care. Some €8 million is being used to augment short-term residential care capacity and has provided for 50 additional short-stay beds sourced from the private sector. An additional 65 beds are to come on stream on a phased basis from March 2015. Some €5 million is being used for home care services, which will provide 400 additional home care packages to benefit 600 discharges across targeted hospitals. Some €2 million is being used to strengthen community intervention teams, which to date have facilitated 571 people in being seen in their own homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The HSE is considering every possible option for alternative accommodation, including vacant beds in private nursing homes, to address delayed discharges. Since 5 January, the HSE has been working to match patients whose acute care has been completed but who require ongoing residential care with suitable placements. This will see a potential movement of a further 250 patients from acute hospitals to other suitable facilities and is in addition to placements already approved under the €25 million delayed discharge initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Matters certainly seem to be moving, but how many beds have been released by discharging patients from acute hospitals? How many does the Minister of State expect will be freed up for people by March so that those who do not need acute hospital care can receive the care most suitable to them and with which they are most comfortable?</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> This crisis in general hospital and community care owes to cuts. Losing 5,000 nurses in recent years is bound to have had an impact. Beds have been closed. Can we open more hospital beds to take in people from accident and emergency departments, which is where the main problem lies?</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Later, I would like to hear from the Minister his opinion on the problem of the registration fee for nurses. They will not be able to pay the €150.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">As the Deputy rightly stated, the registration fee issue is for another discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The €25 million has resulted in 300 extra approvals, with 65 approvals to come on stream in March. On top of these is the ongoing fair deal scheme allocation of 515 beds per month, as I outlined before Christmas when this issue was being discussed. The initiative should make some impact, but we must realise that we have an ageing population and this is winter, when even we get little infections that can be difficult to shift. We are determining what long-term plan needs to be in place to deal with this issue. I refuse to call it a problem, as it is simply part and parcel of what happens as we age. We need to plan for that, which is what we are doing. We have the statistics but planning is important and we are dealing with the issue in a comprehensive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> As far as I know and apart from in community hospitals, which are non-acute, no beds are closed other than those that have been closed for reasons of infection control and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">I accept the Minister of State's comments, but if the Government is planning, it should have planned for what happened a number of months ago. Why are we in this situation if the Government has the statistics?</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> We know from yesterday that, by June, a number of public nursing homes could face bed closures.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">Has the Government planned for that and the fact that, within six months, there could be fewer beds for people who need the care — I hate saying "step-down care" — that they cannot get in the acute hospitals? I refer to the care they need in their communities or homes. How are we planning for that? Is it being factored in for six months down the line? While I acknowledge it is winter, I believe we still need increased care for an elderly, ageing population. I will be elderly some day and hope we will be able to have in place the care that is needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">It is a different subject but it is all connected. I understand we have a plan in regard to HIQA, standards and nursing home units, or long-stay units. As we all know, events can happen completely unexpectedly, or out of the blue, in the area of health that we do not know about and for which we are not planning. The difficulty is that there are times when we know exactly what we need to do but unfortunately do not always have the money to deal with the problem in a timely fashion owing to the circumstances the country finds itself in. However, we know about the issue being raised and do have a plan. My mantra seems to be that we know about the matter and have a plan but sometimes do not have the money. It is only with great good luck that Deputy Collins and I will reach later life, and we should accept that.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I want to ask about the cost to the HSE or State in general arising from legal and medical fees in the tragic case of a clinically dead pregnant woman who was kept on life support for 23 days against the wishes of her family and next of kin. What has been the cost of this horrific case arising from the eighth amendment and involving the taking of unwanted intervention at a time when a health crisis was escalating in the State?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_66">I wish once again to convey my sympathies to the family of the woman at the centre of this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> As the House will know, this case concerned a woman who was brain dead, pregnant and on life support for a number of weeks in a hospital in the State. An application was brought to the High Court by the woman’s family to withdraw somatic life support. Clinicians decided not to do so for fear of legal repercussions arising from Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution. The case was heard in the High Court on 23 and 24 December 2014 by a panel of three judges. The family, the HSE, the interest of the unborn and the mother were all represented, and medical evidence from consultants in intensive care and obstetrics was heard. On 26 December the court issued its judgment authorising the withdrawal of ongoing somatic support.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The HSE has advised me that it is unable to provide the full legal and medical costs relating to this case at the current time. As is normal, legal fees arising from court actions take some time to be submitted and settled. In any event, it is not usual as a general rule to provide cost details at individual level in respect of specific patients as both technical and privacy issues arise in making and providing such calculations. While it will be possible at a certain point to calculate the legal costs, it may not be possible to calculate the medical costs. No additional staff were employed as a result of the case. While an ICU bed was used, it would have been used in any case, albeit by somebody else.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> I expect to receive further information from the HSE on this case as part of my consideration of the High Court judgment and its implications as I wish to ascertain what lessons may need to be learned from this extremely sad and unfortunate case. As I mentioned previously, I fully believe clinicians should be able to make challenging ethical decisions in consultation with their patients and their families, as appropriate, on the basis of best clinical practice rather than on foot of legal advice or under the fear of prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> I ask that the privacy of this family be respected and that it be given the appropriate time and space to grieve its loss.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I also conveyed my sympathies to the family when I raised this issue in the Dáil. I believe it was the only time it was raised. Nobody has mentioned the names of those in question, and nobody knows their names; that is fine but it should not be used as a gag against public representatives raising legitimate questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Dr. Peter Boylan called what happened in the tragic case grotesque and experimental. The Minister should be asking for a report from the doctors on why they felt it necessary to keep the lady on life support when it would seem, according to any information I have looked up, that no 15-week foetus has survived under these circumstances anywhere in the world. The ICU consultant involved said we were dealing with a corpse and could not believe what was going on. It would seem that we have the money to keep women as incubators but we do not have the money for nurses or beds. Can the Minister explain to people suffering from rare, life-limiting and life-threatening conditions why they cannot get medication - relevant cases have been highlighted in recent days - although money is being spent in circumstances such as those described?</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> The Minister of State from the Labour Party, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is shaking her head. Fine Gael introduced the eighth amendment in 1983. The Labour Party is sitting on its hands even though it disagrees with it. It is apologising saying it is in a coalition in an election year and that it will suspend its belief in women's rights for the duration. If I were the Minister of State, I would not be shaking her head.</p>

            <p eId="para_77"> An issue of privacy and decency arises and the family has asked for privacy and for its confidentiality to be respected. We should endeavour to do that to the greatest extent possible. All of this was heard in open court and the doctors gave their reasons and answered the questions. They gave reasons as to why they were not willing to end somatic life support without legal advice and cover. The answers to the Deputy's questions exist already. All these matters were aired in open court. The legal costs are not yet known. It takes time before legal costs are agreed, as the Deputy knows. The medical costs probably cannot be calculated and it may well be the case that there were no additional costs. As I pointed out, the ICU bed would have been used anyway, and the staff involved were employed in any case. There were no additional staff employed.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">It is legitimate to ask how much was spent by the State in defending what is now an absolutely disgraceful and medieval law, which has proven that women are considered to be incubators. High Court cases cost a lot of money; I know that. Having legal representation supplied to the both the unborn and deceased woman was bizarre. The Minister is unable to provide information now. Will there be a time when he can?</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> People watched in horror as the case arose over Christmas. There was considerable comment in social media. It was asked why this was happening when there was a trolley crisis and bed crisis escalating in hospitals. The case brought home to people that this is an invasion of privacy, based on the eighth amendment, in respect of families' decisions. I acknowledge that the Minister admitted it is the eighth amendment and Article 40.3.3° that compelled doctors to take their course of action.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> On the matter of gagging, people on this side of the House have spent their entire lives fighting for social progress but people on the other side of the House have not. Questions and issues such as those in question need to be raised. The Minister should accept that.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">Under the Health Act 1970, as amended, eligibility for health services is based primarily on residency and means. The Deputy will be aware of the publication of the report of the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility and the medical card process review in November 2014. A key recommendation of the expert panel was that a person’s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. Discretion continues to be an integral part of the medical card assessment process. All applications are assessed under the relevant legislation and the HSE's national assessment guidelines. However, to build on the conclusions of the two reports, a suite of actions have been identified to improve the operation of the medical card system, particularly for people with significant medical needs. A detailed programme of reform has been drawn up by the HSE with short, medium and long-term actions to be addressed in the period 2015 to 2016. The HSE has appointed a senior manager, at assistant national director level, with specific responsibility for primary care schemes and eligibility, to lead the reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> I can advise the Deputy that the temporary reinstatement of discretionary medical cards that were previously removed, pending full implementation of actions to improve the operation of the system, remains in place. Holders of discretionary medical cards are no longer included in random reviews and a discretionary medical card issued on the basis of a terminal illness will not be reviewed and end dates are no longer included in the medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> The HSE has ensured a more integrated and sensitive processing of applications, involving a greater exchange of information between the central assessment office and the local health offices on people’s medical circumstances and needs. The HSE is taking steps to establish a clinical advisory group to develop a methodology and guidance for the assessment of applications involving significant medical conditions so as to take account of the burden involved and the needs arising from the condition and to ensure appropriate services are provided for those who need them.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> The number of medical cards held on the basis of discretion having been exercised by the HSE has increased from approximately 50,300 on 1 January 2014 to approximately 76,700 on 1 January 2015. The Deputy can see, therefore, that the process is working.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I thank the Minister of State for her response and appreciate, in particular, the last nugget of information which obviously is pertinent. I commend the Minister and the Minister of State, given that, if I am not mistaken, this is the first time in seven years that the Department of Health's budget will actually be increased. It is also welcome that discretionary medical cards will not be reviewed for individuals who are terminally ill. That is a far more humanitarian way of approaching these issues. The last thing a family member wants when coping with potential grief is to have to deal with reams of paperwork from the Department of Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> Given the difficulties with the medical card system in recent years, culminating in the report published in November 2014, I am pleased that we have seen some movement on the issue. However, a number of such cases have come through my office in recent months. While I am positively disposed to what the Minister of State said, the information with which I have been provided somewhat belies what has happened in individual cases. I appreciate, however, that what has happened in individual cases is not the best way of ascertaining how the whole system operates. Nonetheless, more could be done and I would like to see the Minister of State undertaking a review of the process in the coming months. That would give us an opportunity to debate the matter which I am sure Opposition health spokespersons would welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">The review of the system, both within the Department and the HSE, is virtually continuous. Because of the difficulties that arose with medical cards the matter is constantly being reviewed, re-evaluated and tweaked. There are difficulties concerning medical cards because they no longer technically just give access to a GP or medical services in an acute hospital. Their expansion sometimes causes difficulty. We are examining what additional services are provided and whether it should all come within the ambit of the Department of Health. That is all being examined, but the discretion promised in both reviews by the Government has continued. The Deputy can see from the last piece of information I have provided that clearly the process is working. The humanity and compassion that need to come into play when someone receives a diagnosis, which each and every one of us hopes we will never have to get, must be shown within the system. It is difficult to include this in legislation, but it does need to be provided for.</p>

The approach being taken to medical cards should, for instance, include continuing medical card cover for those seeking employment. That would give them peace of mind when they re-entered the workforce. These changes are being welcomed by the general public. While it is a separate issue to that of the discretionary medical card, it is worth mentioning.</p>

When the Minister was questioned about this issue last week, he boasted that the position had improved and that the numbers on trolleys had dropped again since that horrendous peak figure had been reached. I note that, according to Trolley Watch today, there are 431 patients on trolleys. How long will we lurch from crisis to crisis? When will the Minister get a handle on the issue?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_97">The Government regards trolley waits of over nine hours as unacceptable. I acknowledge the difficulties the current surge in emergency department activity is causing for patients, their families and the staff who are doing their utmost to provide safe, quality care in what are very challenging circumstances. All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care. These plans include the opening of additional overflow areas, the reopening of closed beds, additional diagnostic scans and consultants doing additional ward rounds to improve and speed up the appropriate flow of patients through hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> The Government has provided additional funding of €3 million in 2014 and €25 million in 2015 to address the issue of delayed discharges. Actions being taken include the provision of about 400 additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional fair deal places and an extension of community intervention teams. In addition, Mount Carmel Hospital will reopen later in the spring and provide important relief for Dublin hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> Last month I convened the emergency department task force to help to develop long-term solutions to the problem of overcrowding by providing for an additional focus and momentum in dealing with challenges presented by trolley waits. Following a second meeting last week, the HSE is working on an action plan to be finalised by the end of the month to specifically address emergency department issues with a view to achieving a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> The number of patients on trolleys this morning is 357. They includes patients on trolleys in wards but do not include patients in day wards. Of these, 169 have been on trolleys for more than nine hours. However, we do expect the number to fall below 200 by the end of the day. As the Deputy knows, patients are not discharged overnight; therefore, the figure is always higher in the morning. As patients are discharged during the day, the numbers fall. We, therefore, expect that there will be fewer than 200 by the end of the day, but then, of course, the number will rise again overnight. </p>
            <p eId="para_101"> There are significant variations from Mullingar, Kilkenny, Cavan to Kerry where there is no one on a trolley to as many as 24 being on trolleys for more than nine hours in Beaumont Hospital. I will be happy to answer any further question the Deputy may have.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">Clearly there is some movement as a result of the crisis that arose last week but there are, as stated by the Minister, 357 people still on trolleys today. As I mentioned, yesterday there were 431 people on trolleys, some of them in wards, resulting in there being more people in wards than there should be. I note from the RTE headlines this morning reference to the fact that 4,000 nurses have resigned in the past three years, 5,000 in total have resigned over the past number of years and warning that 1,000 more are to leave in the next year. Also, some 5,000 beds in total have been taken out of the system and 2,000 beds are currently closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> It appears that the measures being taken are small in comparison with the scale of the problem, which gives little confidence that we are not going to continue to lurch from one crisis to another. As acknowledged by the Minister in his responses last week, the emergency measures being taken will lead to the cancellation of non-emergency surgery, which will affect waiting lists and result in other people in the health service suffering. Despite the emergency efforts to deal with the trolley crisis the situation is still out of control. Is it not time that the Minister listened to the nurses, who have now been forced to call for industrial action in the form of a work to rule early next month, that what is needed if we are to get a handle on this crisis is thousands more beds and thousands more nurses, significant extra resources and a reversal of the cuts that have been implemented?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_104">I would point out that 4,000 nurses have not resigned. Rather, the number of nursing posts has been reduced, which is not quite the same thing. Between 2008 and 2013, the number of nursing posts reduced by approximately 5,000 but this is offset in large part by the fact that nurses work additional hours under the Haddington Road agreement and also by the graduate nursing programme. However, in 2014 the number nurses employed by the HSE increased by 500. We are now starting to increase the number of nurses working in our public health system. This is in addition to the fact that we now have record numbers of midwives and more consultants than ever before. It is important to put all of the facts in the public domain. The only thing that is better than the truth is the whole truth.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> If this was a simple problem it would have been solved a long time ago. The difficulties vary from hospital to hospital. The fact that the work to rule will take place in seven hospitals and not all 28 or 40 facilities indicates that there are particular problems in some hospitals. In some hospitals difficulties arise because of late discharges, either because there is no funding available for the fair deal scheme or, as in the case of the Beaumont-Louth area, there are no nursing homes. What is required is different sets of solutions, a national approach and particular approaches in particular hospitals. That is what the emergency departmental task force is all about.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">Yes. According to RTE, the figures it obtained from the HSE indicate that almost 11,000 nurses left the profession between 2010 and 2013 and 1,000 more are scheduled to retire this summer. Is the chaos in our health service the result of people being forced to work harder under the Haddington Road agreement, resulting in the huge culling of nurses from our hospitals, particularly our accident and emergency departments? Is it not the case that the reason nurses are flooding out of the system is because they are at their wits end and completely stressed because their incomes have been slashed, thousands of beds have been closed and billions of euro has been taken out of the health service? Nurses can no longer bear that because not enough resources, staff or beds are available in the system patients and staff are suffering. It is a disaster.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">No, I am not: I am disputing the Deputy's understanding of them. It may well be the case that 11,000 nurses have left the service in the past five years but it is also the case that 6,000 nurses have come into the system. As such, the net reduction in nurses is approximately 5,000 but this has further reduced to 4,500 because the number of nurses increased in 2014. As I said, this is partly offset by the current record number of doctors and midwives in the system, nurses working additional hours and the graduate nursing programme. The number of nursing hours done is not necessarily the same as the number of nurses employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> There are approximately 34,000 nurses in the public health service. If 1,000 of them leave this year, that equates to approximately 3% of the overall number. A 3% turnover in staff in any organisation is not enormous. It is manageable. A particular issue, as mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is that mental health nurses can retire at 55 years of age, although they do not have to do so. We are encouraging them to stay on. Also, the HSE's latest recruitment campaign for nurses had almost 4,000 applicants. There are people who are willing to work in our services.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Deputy for tabling this question. The development of primary care centres through a combination of public and private investment is supporting the delivery of an enhanced range of multidisciplinary, locally accessible primary health care services. To date, there are 85 primary care centres in operation throughout the country, 42 of which have opened since 2011. The HSE uses three mechanisms to deliver primary care infrastructure, including direct build - by the HSE; public-private partnership, PPP; and operational lease with the private sector. There are currently 37 locations where primary care centres are under construction or at an advanced planning stage using one of these three methods of delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> Direct Build centres are funded through the HSE’s multi-annual capital plan, with funding provided for 16 centres in the plan. Some 14 centres are being progressed through public-private partnerships. This project is currently out to tender with three preferred bidders. Tenders are due to be returned early in 2015 and it is expected that the preferred bidder will be selected in Quarter 2, 2015. Subject to successful completion of financial and contractual arrangements, it is expected that construction work will commence before the end of 2015, with the centres expected to be completed by the first half of 2017. To date, 43 primary care centres have been delivered through the Operational Lease model. The HSE is at advanced stages with developers in 28 locations where agreements for lease have been entered into and it is currently at negotiation stage in an additional 32 locations where Letters of Intent have been issued. </p>
            <p eId="para_117"> In November 2014, the HSE advertised an additional 73 locations for delivery of primary care centres by Operational Lease. Friday last, 16 January, was the closing date for receipt of Expressions of Interest. The HSE will review all Expressions of Interest to determine which are suitable for more detailed consideration and progression to the next stage of the process. </p>

            <p eId="para_118">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The primary care centres are a fundamental plank of the Government's strategy to keep people out of hospitals. This question relates to the previous question in regard to trolley usage in our acute hospitals. In Beaumont Hospital, which is in my constituency, many people are being treated for COPD. Treatment of these people outside of the hospital system would result in up to 45 beds per day or 28,500 bed nights per annum being freed up. There is huge potential in regard to the introduction of the primary care centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> Perhaps the Minister of State would provide an update on the status of the Coolock, Darndale and Edenmore primary care centres. The method of delivery of the centres, including by public private partnership or operational lease, are subject to market conditions, developers and so on. Perhaps the Minister of State would update me on how often the list in relation to primary care centres is updated in terms of viability and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The enhancement of primary care centres will have a manifold impact not just for health in the community by stopping people from having to access acute care in hospitals. The second impact it will have is with the recovery of the economy and the building industry which I believe is as important for those engaged in it with regard to their general and mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> I do not have the information on the Deputy’s specific area but I will get it for him. Primary care provision is reviewed very often. The progress we are making in it is extraordinary and going at a rate of knots. The interest in it is incredible too. I attended one of the meet-the-buyers sessions recently and it was impossible to get in the door due to the extent of interest. It is about ensuring we have proper facilities in primary care and, equally, that we get GPs, general practitioners, to co-operate through providing their specialisms and covering certain geographical areas. There are difficulties in some areas, as Members know, but we are managing it.</p>

What are the figures for 2015 and 2016 for the Health Service Executive's, HSE, direct own build of primary care centres? Obviously, the delivery of primary care centres is going to take significant pressures off acute hospitals. People will want to stay in their communities rather than necessarily having to travel to hospitals. The sooner more of these primary care centres get up and running the better.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The budget for the nursing homes support scheme for this year is €948.8 million. The budget for 2015 reflects an increase of €10 million from the position in 2014. This €10 million increase has been allocated to the scheme as part of the initiative relating to the issue of delayed discharges and has allowed for the provision of an additional 300 long-term residential care beds. It has also reduced the time spent on the placement list from 15 weeks to 11 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> My Department and the HSE are working to ensure the resources are available to deliver the best possible outcomes for older people. This will require an integrated approach across community, residential and other service areas. It is clear that even with this additional €10 million, the scheme will remain under pressure and the longer term position, therefore, needs to be carefully considered. The review of the nursing homes support scheme, as well as considering how the scheme has operated to date, is expected to identify some of the issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including the future financing of the full range of supports for older people. Work is well advanced on this review and it is expected to be completed by the end of this quarter. As the scheme is statutory based, the implementation of recommendations arising from the review will require amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I thank the Minister of State for that information. She claimed there will be a €10 million increase for the fair deal scheme which represents a 1% increase in its overall budget of €1 billion. That is insignificant. I would not even elevate it to a drop in the ocean as it will have no effect. The Minister of State stated it is intended to get the average waiting time down from 15 weeks to 11 weeks. I know many people who were on the waiting list for funding for 20 weeks. When they were finally approved for funding, they had to wait another 20 weeks before a cheque actually arrived to pay for the fair deal scheme. Despite the 1% increase in funding in 2015, we will still be 400 beds short compared to what was available in 2013. The Minister of State must address in her review the issue of the HSE's own community nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> I am also concerned that she said this review will require legislation. Will we even get to it in the life of this Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_132">It is that type of talk - this €10 million is only a drop in the ocean - that got us into the position we are in today. As if €10 million did not have a significant impact for the extra 300 people who could avail of the scheme. It made a significant impact. This type of attitude towards public finances - that <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude that €10 million does not matter and throw in what is there - is what got us here.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> We are very conscious that we must be careful about the difficulties in the provision of care for older people into the future. We are equally conscious that we do need additional resources. To be honest and straight about it, provision should have been put into the original legislation for this. I believe the fair deal scheme should be demand-led with tight access. We do not need new legislation - that is what Deputy Sean Fleming chose to misunderstand - but an amendment to existing legislation, namely the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. The Deputy is long enough here to know that is not new legislation but an amendment to an Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">An amendment to legislation will require a Bill to go through the House. That is new legislation in simple English. Legislation can be big or small.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> Everyone welcomed the extra 300 places but there are still over 2,000 people waiting for the scheme. It is not even a drop in the ocean as far as those people are concerned. The Minister of State must address the issue of why she is seeking to privatise the scheme. We know about the differences between the Labour Party and Fine Gael, namely the latter is a privatisation party. I would have thought Labour had a bit more of the common interest and the good of the people at heart. I hope in this review the Minister of State will push for community nursing homes. We have spoken several times about Abbeyleix District Hospital and St. Brigid's Hospital in Shaen, Portlaoise, County Laois. For a small amount of money - a couple of million euro, not €10 million - 70 extra beds could be provided for the scheme which would be far cheaper than going the private route. It would also be far more economical to utilise the staff in those hospitals who are only dealing with respite care to provide services in the public community nursing home sector rather than privatising it.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">It is the Government’s intention to have a combination of residences available to people in the scheme, a significant proportion of which will include the public sector. We have 129 public long-stay nursing homes residences. We cannot afford to lose any one of them whether it is at Shaen, Abbeyleix or Cork. We are in constant negotiation with HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority, about how that can be managed. We have made it very clear that we cannot afford to lose any of them. I am a great believer in public service and will continue to be. The public service provides a different service than that provided by the private sector. The private sector does an extraordinary job in certain circumstances but both are needed in this area. Both need to co-operate in this area too.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_138">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_139">— having regard to the motion passed by Dáil Éireann on 11th June 2014 which recognised the need to establish the facts regarding the deaths of children at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway between 1925 and 1961, including arrangements for the burial of these children, and which further acknowledged the considerable public anxiety as to the conditions generally in mother and baby homes operational in the State in that era;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_140">— noting that it is the opinion of the Government that these matters of significant public concern require, in the public interest, examination by the establishment of a Commission of Investigation;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_141">— noting that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has led the Government’s consideration of these sensitive matters;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_142">— noting the factual information compiled and the specific matters identified for further consideration in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th July 2014 and which has assisted to inform Government considerations on the scope, format and terms of reference for a Commission of Investigation;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_143">— and further noting that a draft Order proposed to be made by the Government under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 (No. 23 of 2004) has been duly laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th January 2015 in respect of the foregoing matters referred to, together with a statement of reasons for establishing a Commission under that Act;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_144">approves the draft Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters) Order, 2015 and the statement of reasons for establishing a commission of investigation. </p>
          <p eId="para_145">I welcome the opportunity to bring this motion to the House. I begin by acknowledging the Irish women and children who were in mother and baby homes in this country in the last century. Many will be following proceedings in the House today with a great deal of anticipation. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I believe that by setting up the commission with all the necessary powers to get to the information required we will come to a greater understanding of how it was that we, as a society, failed in our treatment of vulnerable single women and children in these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Last May people in Ireland and around the world were shocked by media reports about what was described as a mass grave in the mother and baby home in Tuam, County Galway. The sense of indignation we all felt about this was palpable. While some academics had examined these matters, as a state we had failed to come to terms with a harrowing reality of our past; the manner in which single women and their children had been treated in mother and baby homes, how they had come to be there in the first place and the circumstances of their departure from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> As Members know, I came into this office last July, shortly after a motion had been passed by Dáil Éireann in June on the need to establish the facts regarding the deaths of children at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway and the subsequent publication of the report of the interdepartmental group on mother and baby homes. As an immediate priority, I was concerned to meet and hear, at first hand, the accounts of many people and groups that had expressed views on the need for a full exploration of all the issues raised by the discoveries in Tuam. These included demands to explore a wide range of matters – many directly related to the disturbing account provided by local historian Catherine Corless; others related to the wider issue of mother and baby homes generally and the role they had played in Ireland for such a long period.<b>
						</b></p>
          <p eId="para_148"> For those who gave me individual accounts of their experiences, I found them compelling and greatly appreciate the willingness and courage of those who shared their personal and often harrowing experiences with me. On my own behalf and that of the Government, I thank them for taking the time to meet me. Other advocacy groups, public bodies and political colleagues across the spectrum also provided me with a wide range of views, all of which assisted me greatly in focusing the terms of reference in what was an extensive scoping process, given the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> At its meeting on 8 January 2015 the Government agreed the processes to establish a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters. The following day I published the draft order now before the House in the presence of former residents of some of these homes and their representative groups. The terms of reference have been developed having regard to the requirements of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. The order should be read in the context of the significant powers, procedures and protections laid down in the enabling legislation. I think all of the groups I met agreed that making this a feasible task which could be completed in a realistic timeframe was critical. However, this must be balanced with ensuring we do not compromise on the need for the commission to answer the questions raised. Given the breadth of the issues raised with me, this has been a challenge. </p>
          <p eId="para_150"> As Members of the House will be aware, when this debate began, the issues appeared narrow – the high rates of mortality and the burial arrangements. However, the debate broadened to the question of the operational arrangements in mother and baby homes and the care and welfare provided for both mothers and babies. As our work progressed, a further set of issues arose about the whole phenomenon of mother and baby institutions in Ireland as a response to the issue of crisis pregnancies over a much longer period of time. As individuals and groups made submissions and following the work of the interdepartmental group and my own meetings, it was clear to me that the issue of entry and exit pathways of both women and children raised further questions regarding the social, political and legal environment that prevailed and how it evolved over time. Further, the links between mother and baby homes and the issue of adoption, both before and after the introduction of legal adoption in Ireland, were highlighted. It included questions about children adopted and taken abroad and children whose parentage was concealed with and perhaps without the consent or knowledge of their mothers. As is clear, this is a much wider agenda than our starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides an effective, prompt and transparent mechanism to investigate complex and sensitive matters, while also respecting fair procedures and natural justice. I am pleased to bring to the House the draft order and statement of reasons for establishing a commission in accordance with the legislation. The terms of reference, included as a Schedule to the order, reflect the range of matters that we were asked to consider and are a fair and balanced response to the many requests for issues and items to be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> As the draft order has been laid before the House and published more widely, for the purposes of the motion I propose to focus on its principal objectives and, in particular, the rationale for key provisions within the terms of reference. The draft order contains a number of preliminary recitals and four main provisions. The recitals provide details of the statutory powers under which the commission is being established by the Government and confirm the date of the Government decision as 8 January 2015. They acknowledge that the Government order may be signed by the Taoiseach when a draft of the proposed order and a statement of the reasons for establishing the commission have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House. </p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Articles 1 to 3, inclusive, provide for the Short Title; define the relevant enabling legislation; establish the commission and task it with investigating and reporting on matters which the Government considers to be of significant public concern. This is the threshold for establishing a statutory commission of investigation. The terms of reference have been developed in accordance with section 4(2) of the 2004 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> Article 4 designates the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs as the Minister responsible for overseeing administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission. I will receive the reports and discharge related functions under the Act. In addition, the order authorises me to appoint members to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The terms of reference of the commission are focused on a combination of four distinct factors. First, clarifying that the intended focus is on single women and children accommodated for the purpose of receiving extended and supervised maternity and infant care services in mother and baby homes. Second, defining the specific issues of public concern as discrete matters to be investigated. Third, specifying a list of mother and baby homes as well as providing for examination of equivalent experiences within the network of county homes. Fourth, defining the relevant period from 1922 to 1998 while allowing the commission to reduce the relevant period in respect of any component part or institution if it considers it appropriate to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> The approach taken serves to provide a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in mother and baby homes during the relevant period. The motion approved by Dáil Éireann had a central emphasis on mother and baby homes. During the course of our deliberations a clear consensus emerged on the need to thoroughly examine the experience of those who spent time in mother and baby homes. Practices in these homes have not featured prominently in the various reviews and investigations to date. Rather, they have dealt with many of the past abuses inflicted on vulnerable citizens, many of whom were women and children. Accordingly, the terms of reference focus on institutions which can clearly be identified as having the primary function of providing sheltered and supervised ante and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, which included board and lodgings, as well as an ethos that those running the institutions considered would promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers before they left the institution or give them training to live independently. As established in the academic literature, in many cases institutional approaches were based on a moralistic approach intended to rehabilitate single mothers and to make arrangements regarding the future care of their children. On the basis of the available information I am satisfied that the 14 institutions included in the appendix to schedule 1 to the draft order meet these criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> It is clear from the available information that in some county homes mother-and-baby-type services appear to have been a notable focus of operations. For this reason the terms of reference provide that the commission will also consider a representative sample of county homes in its investigations and reports. The sample will be selected by the commission based on evidence of the extent of the operation of this specific function, considering factors such as the number of relevant births, the duration of such operations and the typical length of time for which these mothers and children were accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Article 1 ensures that the primary focus of the investigation relates to the experiences of women and children who resided in mother and baby homes over the period. The following matters will be investigated: entry arrangements and exit pathways of single women, including consideration of the extent of their participation in relevant decisions; living conditions and care arrangements in these institutions; mortality among mothers and children, including causes, circumstances and rates; post-mortem practices and procedures, including reporting, burial arrangements and the transfer of remains for anatomical examination; the extent of compliance with relevant regulatory and ethical standards in respect of systemic vaccine trials identified by the commission as having been conducted on children in these homes; entry arrangements and exit pathways for mothers and children leaving institutions, including patterns of referral and relevant relationships with other entities; and the extent to which any group of residents may have been treated differently on a systematic basis on any grounds, including race, disability or religion.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> The commission is tasked with undertaking appropriate comparative analysis, where relevant, to assist the general understanding of its findings. Article 2 provides that the investigation will cover the years from 1922, that is to say, from the establishment of the State, to 1998. The commission may reduce the relevant period for any part of its investigation where it deems it appropriate to do so. The series of definitions included in Article 8 bring additional specificity to these investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Article 1.7 requires the commission to investigate the nature of the relationship between mother and baby homes and other key institutions, including children's homes, orphanages and adoption societies. In fact, some of these institutions were on the same sites as the mother and baby homes, while others were not. This will allow the commission to investigate concerns about how children exited such institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> The terms of reference require the commission to identify the extent to which children's welfare and best interests were considered in making arrangements for their placement, whether through boarding out, fostering or adoption, in Ireland and abroad. Furthermore, the terms of reference stipulate that the commission should identify the extent of mothers' participation in such decisions, including procedures relating to mothers' consent and the extent to which these procedures were sufficient to ensure that consent was full, free and informed. There appears to have been well-established patterns of referral to and through these services to final placements for many of the children. The commission will investigate evidence relating to patterns of referral, relationships and co-operation with other entities and intermediary organisations as well as any systematic arrangements for the placement of children. This will allow the commission sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing such children for adoption abroad as well as examining situations in which the child's parentage was concealed either by omission or sometimes by illegal means.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> The terms of reference provide for a comprehensive investigative framework involving interlinked and concurrent lines of inquiry. While Articles 10 to 15 provide some general guidance, the commission is independent in the performance of its functions and in deciding how best to approach its work. The general intent of Articles 13 and 14 is to reiterate the need for a prompt and thorough investigation and to provide that the commission should tailor its processes and methodologies as appropriate. In addition to the main investigation methods, the confidential committee provided for in Articles 3 and 4 will facilitate individuals who may wish to describe their experiences of living or working in relevant homes to the commission. On the basis of submissions from the public it is anticipated that some former residents will welcome this opportunity to share their experience. This module will allow the commission to ground its work in the reality of the experience of mothers and children in these homes. Since this approach allows for the telling of uncontested testimony in private, the committee will produce a report of a general nature on the experience of single women and children from this module. The commission will establish relevant protocols for the effective running of this module, including procedures to protect the identity of individuals who may wish for their identity to remain confidential during the conduct of the commission and its subsequent reporting. Alongside this, the social history module will provide context through an objective and comprehensive analysis of key issues. This module is intended to assist the commission's determination on a range of matters in accordance with Article 12. Significantly, this analysis will benefit from the extensive legal powers of the commission to access relevant records. Ten specific elements are detailed for analysis in Article 11 of the terms of reference. In addition, Article 15 provides that the commission should have regard to the facts established through previous inquires into related institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> I believe that the Commissions of Investigation Act and the terms of reference of the commission provide adequate opportunity for the commission to take an independent view of the adequacy of scope in view of its task. Since the decision to establish this investigation was announced there have been public calls for the inclusion of a broad range of matters. I acknowledge that some may have wished to include a broader and even more diverse range of matters within the terms of reference. While some of these matters are outside the intended remit of the commission, Article 6 provides certain opportunities for the commission to make recommendations. This will be relevant to those who believe that the process to date has not uncovered information relevant to their specific circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The commission may make any recommendations it considers appropriate in any of its reports. This is not limited to matters within the direct scope of its investigations and may include issues which it deems to warrant further investigation in the public interest. As part of the social history module the commission is tasked with reporting to me on any specific matter that it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest but which is not covered by the existing scope. This mechanism takes maximum advantage of the investigative powers, resources and expertise of the commission and ensures that any additional matter which may warrant investigation can be brought to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for further consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I was delighted to announce the Government's approval of a three-person commission chaired by Judge Yvonne Murphy. Judge Murphy will be assisted by the eminent historian, Professor Mary Daly and the international legal expert on child protection and adoption, Dr. William Duncan. These appointments reflect my understanding of the need for a depth of knowledge and expertise across these areas which will be required to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the issues and for well-grounded reports and recommendations in due course. I am sure Members of the House will agree that we are fortunate to have such distinguished persons willing to take on the task of investigating over three-quarters of a century of practices in mother and baby homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The terms of reference envisage the submission of a final report to me within three years. In addition, Article 5 specifies that the reports from the confidential committee and the social history module would be completed within 18 months. These timeframes are ambitious but I want to ensure these important issues are investigated in a timely manner given the age profile of many of the women and children who were resident in these homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_167"> On the basis that the commission would be expected to complete its work within 36 months, the Government has noted that costs, exclusive of third party legal costs, are estimated to be in the order of €21.5 million. This includes the funding necessary to meet the set-up and operational needs of the commission and some additional funds to meet the demands attaching to administrative oversight of the commission within my Department. An initial allocation of €6 million has been provided by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the Revised Estimate Volume to meet costs arising in 2015. The staffing complement of the commission will reflect the scope of the terms of reference and the ambitious timeframe. In addition to direct staffing costs, set-up and ongoing costs will arise for the establishment of the Commission’s offices at 73 Lower Baggot Street, ICT, records management, administration, travel and so forth. My Department is engaging with Judge Yvonne Murphy, the Chair designate, in this regard to ensure a smooth start to the commission’s work. The commission will also have the scope and funds, under section 8 of the Act, to appoint persons with relevant professional expertise and specialists skills to assist its investigations. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I believe that this commission will be critically important in helping us to come to terms with our own history and in understanding who we are as a people. The Government is confident that the proposed terms of reference provide an ambitious and appropriately focused set of tasks which can be accomplished by this commission within a realistic time frame and I commend this motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_184"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. As we all know, early last May Ireland was once again the subject of international media attention for all of the wrong reasons because of the story about mass graves at the Tuam mother and baby home. The coverage at the time and subsequent contributions to the debate proved to be sensational and paid little regard to the fact that what was being said and reported had a very real impact on the lives of many families. I am conscious that what we say here today, as well as what we say into the future, has a real impact on so many people's lives. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The most positive outcome of this story was that it proved to be a catalyst for the establishment of a commission of investigation. From the outset, my party and I advocated and supported the establishment of this commission in order to shine a light and to establish the true facts about what took place in the dark days of our past. We have heard stories of many barbaric practices visited upon women solely and exclusively because they had children out of wedlock. We have heard stories from this era of children who, because they were born to unmarried mothers, were treated like chattels rather than human beings. I wish to put on the record of this House my admiration for and thanks to the many survivors who came forward and spoke so movingly and truthfully and who chose to share their very personal stories so that the terms of reference of the commission could meet the expectations of the many women and children who went through these institutions. I wish to acknowledge the presence of a number of those women in the Public Gallery today. </p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I use the word "institutions" rather than "homes" because when one thinks of homes, one thinks of places of love and security, where people feel safe. When one listened to the women's stories, there was no feeling of love or security. I was very humbled to hear the stories that the women chose to share with us. I heard stories of siblings in the same institution who did not know they were brother and sister and of identity theft. Such stories made me realise just how fortunate I was to grow up in a loving home. It also made me realise that we, as legislators, are in a very fortunate position. We are in the privileged position of being able to ensure that the people who had to endure many years of suffering in these institutions can have their stories heard. A proper commission of investigation is being set up so that their stories will be heard, the State can apologise and those who were responsible for barbaric practices can be held to account. That is what we must do and we have to get it right. </p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I must acknowledge the role played by the Minister and his officials. To be honest, I was worried at the outset that the terms of reference would be too narrow. I acknowledge that in hindsight, it was prudent to take additional time to meet the survivor groups and members of the Opposition and to hear the concerns of so many with regard to what should be included in the terms of reference. It must be acknowledged that the Minister went a long way and I want to put that on the Dáil record. The Minister listened to requests that the commission be made up of renowned personnel and appointed Judge Yvonne Murphy. No one could dispute that appointment. The Minister also listened to the request from survivors that an international expert be appointed to the commission and made such an appointment. I wish to acknowledge that fact and to wish the members of the commission and its staff the very best of luck. The Minister has also ensured that there is a tight timeframe and that the commission cannot go on indefinitely. That is important because many people, because of their age, need answers sooner rather than later. The Minister has included the entry arrangements and exit pathways of single women, as well as the living and care arrangements in these institutions, many of which were so barbaric as to be incomprehensible to us today. The mortality rates, for example, were astounding. We know that infants in these institutions were 3.8 times more likely to die than those born into a loving environment. Post mortem practices will also be examined by the commission, as well as compliance with regulatory and ethical standards. The commission will also examine the entry arrangements and exit pathways for mothers and children leaving these institutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_188"> The Minister said that groups were systematically treated differently on various grounds including race, disability and religion. He failed to recognise that one of the main reasons they were treated differently was their marital status, which must be looked at. We have all forcefully advocated that no institution should be left out. This should be an inclusive commission. I would also urge the Minister to ensure that it is the ultimate commission of investigation. Let us ensure that no victim is left out in the cold.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I support calls made by groups representing survivors that additional institutions be included in the investigation as this would save the State money in the long run by eliminating the need for further inquiries. The most recent inquiry established by the Government, the investigation into the Magdalen laundries, was widely criticised for lacking independence and transparency, two characteristics that are necessary ingredients for any inquiry. The Minister must not make the same mistakes. He must listen to advice and ensure the commission deals with all practices that resulted in the State and society failing vulnerable women and children who were commonly known as illegitimate at the time. </p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The Minister has consistently stated that, under Article 6, everyone will have an opportunity to share their experiences. This issue is primarily addressed in the social history module. There is no guarantee that a request by the commission of inquiry for approval to expand its remit would be approved. With a general election set to be held in the next 18 months, the Minister is not in a position to give such a commitment as he may not be in office when the commission of inquiry's first interim report is completed. What is the threshold for inclusion in the commission of inquiry's remit? Aside from the named institutions, the onus is on victims to prove that additional institutions warrant investigation. The starting point, however, should be to believe victims. We have acknowledged the contributions victims made in meetings with Deputies from all parties and groups and the Minister. This country has a chequered history when it comes to believing victims, especially children. Have we learned anything? Rather than re-victimising people, we should support those who had to deal with State sanctioned abuse. That this abuse took place in the relatively distant past does not lessen the crime as abuse remains abuse. </p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I received correspondence which stated that despite the use of the flexible phrase "children's home", the Minister more or less stated it was a matter for the commission of inquiry to decide which homes to investigate. While Westbank, Temple Hill <i>et al.</i> will probably be included in the inquiry, the fact that several of the best known and widely used institutions have been omitted by name is a concern that could be eased for survivors in an instant by simply including the names of a number of institutions after the generic list in the terms of reference. The relevant names are listed in the amendment. The inclusion of these ten institutions in the terms of reference will be vital to address the concerns of the survivor community. Given that the institutions in question will almost certainly be considered by the commission of inquiry, why not include them now and address the concerns of many individuals who would feel an enormous sense of relief if they were to see these names listed in the terms of reference?</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The phenomenon of child trafficking is not a recent one. Many children who were born under the stigma of illegitimacy, as well as others, were trafficked. Children were conveniently exported for cash, without safeguards and with no regard shown for the constitutional rights of their families. Despite the establishment on 1 January 1953 of a legal framework for adoptions, many children were removed from their families in direct contravention of the safeguards and provisions provided for in the Act. I recently met a lady who recounted a powerful story in which described herself as being fortunate to have been adopted and to have escaped the harshness and bleakness of life in Westbank. What her story reveals, however, is troubling because her adoption was illegal and contravened the legislative framework that was in place. The Adoption Act refers to consent being full, free and informed and only an option for unmarried persons. This was not the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The investigation begins and ends with the prescribed list of mother and baby homes. The Adoption Rights Alliance fears that this places between 60% and 70% of all unmarried girls and women whose children were forcefully adopted beyond the scope of the investigation. The decision to exclude private adoption agencies must be revisited. It is well documented that abuse took place in the adoption system and it would be best to deal with this evidence by way of a commission of inquiry. As Deputies have repeatedly stated, the commission of inquiry must be the ultimate commission and one which allows all victims to make their voices heard. For this reason, I am disappointed that the adoption (information and tracing) Bill remains unpublished, despite being promised for the past four years. The Bill must not deal only with prospective adoptions. Legislation is needed to deal with all of those who wish to have the answers to which they are entitled. Failure to introduce such legislation would be a grievous insult to the mothers and children who bravely shared their stories with the nation and would undermine and undo the positive contribution the Minister has made. </p>
          <p eId="para_194"> This week, I was contacted in my clinic by siblings who had vaccines tested on them as part of a clinical trial. They lived in the vicinity of a mother and baby home and vividly remember the trials being carried out. They believe the doctor in question may have wished to compare the outcomes of the trial for children living in normal homes with those of children brought up in an institution. They fear their story will not be heard and despite regular contacts with the Department of Health, they have been unable to access their records. This issue must be addressed. As I repeatedly informed the Minister when we met, everyone must be made aware that this commission of inquiry is taking place. It must be advertised as widely as possible to ensure people realise they can come forward, be treated in a sensitive and confidential manner and have their stories heard. </p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The single most important issue for many elderly survivors is the failure to separate the commission of inquiry from an acknowledgement, an apology and redress. While the religious and the State are both culpable, the State is the ultimate protector of citizens. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has consistently criticised Ireland's failure to provide adequate redress in circumstances of State wrongdoing. The establishment of the commission of inquiry is an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the State. It is disingenuous to fail to make provision for redress given that redress will become inevitable when the commission of inquiry delivers its preliminary report in 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> The terms of reference have come a long way from those that were initially mooted, primarily because the Minister listened to Opposition Deputies, survivors and advocacy groups. Let us make this commission of inquiry the ultimate investigation and ensure no victim is left out in the cold. The Minister has an opportunity to leave a positive legacy in this area by doing the right thing. I appeal to him to listen to the concerns expressed in this debate and act accordingly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_198">The survivors of mother and baby homes and similar institutions present in the Visitors Gallery represent not only themselves and each other but thousands of the most poorly treated of our citizens whose life experiences, exposed now as never before, stand out to the eternal shame of the State and all who contributed to its practices towards and treatment of single mothers and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Successive Governments, in failing to offer a real and meaningful apology and redress, have compounded the survivors' hurt and pain. While the fact a commission of investigation is now being established is a welcome and long overdue development, I am acutely aware and very disappointed that many victims of that system have been excluded from the terms of reference of the investigation. I have previously expressed disappointment with the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes announced last Friday week. While I acknowledge and welcome that the number of institutions included in the terms of reference of the inquiry has been expanded, I am mindful that a significant number of people will feel excluded and marginalised, even shunned, by the Government's refusal to include the institution or setting that dominates their childhood memory.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is the third Minister we have engaged with on this issue. While the number of homes to be addressed has increased from nine to 14, significant exclusions such as the Magdalen laundries and Westbank remain. We presented an extensive submission to the Minister with significant recommendations following continuous consultation with survivors and advocacy groups. I repeatedly emphasised to the Minister and to his predecessor the importance of inclusivity, of leaving no one out and of not presenting a closed door to any survivor. Many of those who remain outside the scope of the inquiry will find that personal exclusion most hurtful. A lifetime of marginalisation is now to continue, with little prospect of even an acknowledgement of their experiences and their pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> As the inquiry will span from the foundation of the State to 1998, it is also a matter of serious concern that many survivors are in senior years and may not live to see either an acknowledgement or redress. This process will be cold comfort for many whose individual and collective stories are an indictment of Irish society, civil and religious, throughout all of the 20th century. We see today's Dáil address of the Government resolution to establish the commission as an opportunity hopefully to secure the inclusion of all mother and baby homes and similar institutions. We have recommended a number of amendments, to which I will come shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> At this point, I acknowledge the work of Catherine Corless and of those in the NGO sector who have striven for truth and justice for all whose lives have been blighted by their experiences in these institutions. That a real and substantive opportunity for survivors to be heard and hopefully to be properly acknowledged is being established to date, its deficiencies aside, is down in the first instance, to their tireless, and at times unpopular, work on behalf of those who suffered so much at the hands of these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I have long called for any inquiry into mother and baby homes to cover all such homes and all aspects of the treatment of women and children, including high mortality rates and burial practices. When I spoke on Sinn Féin's motion on the issue in the Dáil in June of last year, I stated that an inquiry was absolutely necessary and that it must be undertaken as soon as possible. We have known for a long time now that women and children placed by the State under the so-called care of religious orders and other church institutions in this country between the 1920s and the 1970s were treated as the outcasts of society and as non-people. In July, I spoke out on the road-map set out by the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mother and Baby Homes. I felt, at that stage, that it did not go far enough and that county homes and Magdalen laundries should definitely be included. The issues of adoptions, both Catholic and Protestant, and of vaccination trials should also be included. At this stage, there has been no word of redress of any kind in this report. That too, and much more, must now be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I also expressed concern at the appointment of Judge Yvonne Murphy to chair the commission. Judge Murphy was also appointed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to report on symphysiotomy and she produced what I and many victims of that barbarous practice believe was a fundamentally flawed report. That said, I wish her and her co-members of the new commission of investigation success in what they are now to embark upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> We have seen fully revealed the horrors of the industrial schools for boys and young men and of the Magdalen laundries for girls and young women. We also know of the regime endured by young mothers and children in mother and baby homes, including the effective imprisonment of pregnant women, forced adoptions and the sale of babies by religious orders to wealthy Irish-American families. We know of women and girls shunned by their families and disgracefully banished, put away and placed out of sight. We know of individuals who discovered late in their lives that they had brothers and sisters they had never heard of before, and some who had brothers and sisters whom they knew but were never aware they were siblings.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> It is important to investigate the truth of past wrongs and past abuses such as those in mother and baby homes, not only for the survivors but also for the well-being of our society today and into the future. They were treated like subhumans, forced to wear uniforms in some cases and subjected to forced and illegal adoptions, as well as physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We must ask why was Irish society willing to turn a blind eye. What forces in their midst compelled so many to silence, to acquiescence? I hope the commission of investigation will speak out clearly on the underlying causes. Similar commissions of investigation into other human rights abuses should also be established, including, as I have already said, the survivors of symphysiotomy, another issue that has seen the abused turned away from the doors of power for many years. They too were young mothers subjected to the excesses of adherence to religious fundamentalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Foremost in our thoughts today should be the surviving mothers, who endured what was in reality their incarceration in these institutions, and the surviving adopted children, many of them farmed out or adopted, who wish to find out the truth about the identity of their parents and whether they have siblings and extended families. I hope that this resolution, preferably with our amendments, will help provide the information, redress and, ultimately, solace for all those affected, but I repeat that this can only happen if all affected are included. We cannot have a hierarchy of victims, with some deemed inadmissible.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I will now explain the elements of our amendment, which earnestly seeks to address what we believe are omissions and deficiencies in the Government's terms of reference and draft order for the establishment of the commission. I call on the Minister to give our amendment the attention it deserves and strongly urge him to amend the terms of reference and statement of reasons for establishing the commission of investigation. I will now go through some of the details of this. </p>
          <p eId="para_209"> We are conscious of the fact that Article 1 refers only to mother and baby homes and does not refer directly to related institutions and agencies. We seek to correct that. We note the absence in Article 1.1 of any express reference to inter institutional transfer across the island of Ireland, North to South or South to North and elsewhere. This is hugely important in the context of so-called "exit pathways". Not only in Article 1.3 but throughout the proposals, we note the reference to mortality and believe a reference "and morbidity" should be added. In Article 1.4, in the absence of an express provision directing the commission where evidence of mass or unmarked graves are found, we suggest it should endeavour to identify the remains, notify families where possible, establish cause of death, including by use of the most technologically advanced and scientific methods, and otherwise enable arrangements to be made for more appropriate reburial. In Article 1.8, we note the reference to religion, race, Traveller identity or disability, but there is no reference to marital status or socioeconomic status. We believe this is critical in regard to the women placed in these institutions. </p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Article 2, sets the timeframe to be covered by the commission to from 1922 to 1998. I would like to be able to affirm to the House that after 1998, there were no further concerns. However, I am not of that view. I believe the timeframe should be from 1922 to the present day. We also note the absence of the following provision, which should appear after Article 2 and commend that this be added:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_211"> The commission shall take proactive measures to alert individuals affected by its inquiry, in person where known or through advertising and by means of public statements, in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, in Britain, in the United States and in such other jurisdictions where those affected may reasonably be thought likely to reside, to ensure they understand their rights to testify in private or in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">We strongly urge that every effort is employed to ensure the maximum number of people affected by the experiences that so many have had in their childhood are included so that no-one out of a lack of knowledge of what is taking place is excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> We also propose the following provisions should appear before Article 3. Pursuant to the provisions of section 11 of the Act, the commission shall provide for a public hearing of testimony by persons who were formerly resident or who worked in or were otherwise affected by the institutions listed in Schedule 1 during the relevant period as of right, if such persons so request or if the commission is satisfied that it is otherwise desirable in the interest of both the investigation and fair procedures to hear in public all or part of the evidence of a witness that the commission has called. In this regard, the commission shall make recommendations to the Minister as to necessary arrangements regarding the right to legal advice and or advocacy of those testifying before the commission. In this instance, this concerns not only those who are of the 14 institutions listed and the county homes. It is hugely important that all who have been through these experiences, including those whose particular settings are not included in the Government's list, have access not only to the confidential committee, but that they have the right to request of the commission of investigation that they be heard also in public. This should be a right for all who wish to take that course.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> In regard to the recommendations made on the conclusion of either the interim or final reports of the commission, we recommend that one of the component parts of its consideration of the question of effective remedy must be official acknowledgment, apology and memorial. In consideration of the timing of remedies, taking into account the advanced age and infirmity of many of the identified survivors we believe it is important that the earliest opportunity is availed of to ensure the apology and acknowledgement is put on public record. We have listed ten related institutions for inclusion in appendix 1 and have added in eleventh place that any others that the commission may identify during the course of its investigation should be included. I strongly commend each of those we have listed and have argued consistently for their inclusion. It is important the Magdalen laundries, the registered adoption agencies and related institutions are also included in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I respectfully appeal, not only on my behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin, but first and foremost on behalf of all of the victims and survivors, that the Minister favourably consider the amendment we have tabled and allow for the critical changes we believe are necessary to make this commission of investigation the one that everyone can sign up to with confidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I welcome the establishment of the commission of inquiry and believe its terms of reference are broad-ranging and well thought out. The fact there will be an interim report and that flexibility has been built into the terms of reference is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I acknowledge the work of Catherine Corless and believe we would not be here today but for the information she unearthed. The image she exposed of the remains of children and babies who died in Tuam is haunting and sent shock waves not just across the country but internationally. When we consider that at around that same time the Luas works were going in Dublin and the city centre came to a standstill when historical remains were unearthed outside Trinity College, not to deal with these remains in an equal manner reaffirms posthumously the status these children had in life. It is vital that this issue is dealt with in the terms of reference and it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> This commission should not just be about restorative justice or about issuing a State apology, but about learning important lessons as a people and being true to the principles on which the State was founded. The Proclamation stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_220"> The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all of its parts, ... cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">We have let whole sections of our country down and denied the principles on which the State was founded.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The litany of issues, including in industrial schools, reinforces the necessity for us to learn lessons and to build a different republic in which we are true to the principles on which the State was founded.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> The terms of reference cover the years 1922 to 1998. Some institutions existed prior to the foundation of the State but nothing was done to reform them with the State reinforcing inequality rather than reforming them. The church was trusted as though it was an arm of the State even though it was known incredible cruelty was taking place. The State had no entitlement to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> This is not about only the mother and baby homes; it is also about people who were fostered and used, for example, in agricultural labour and so on. The flexibility of the terms of reference needs to cater for that, as they did in the case of the Magdalen laundries. The UN report called it when we could not call it by stating people were incarcerated in the Magdalen laundries. The report pulled no punches stating they were places of forced labour with slavery-like conditions. The Minister said there would be flexibility in the terms of reference, which I have acknowledged, but the issues relating to the Magdalen laundries have not been concluded. I would like that flexibility fully exploited if the terms of reference are not amended because, for example, some religious institutions have been less than forthcoming with information. As has been pointed out previously, even today the victims are not the ones who are believed. The religious institutions still are believed and that has to end under this commission of inquiry.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">It has been a long road in the quest for justice for the people in the Visitors Gallery who, over a lifetime, have carried the damage done to them by the State. Like other Deputies, I would like to acknowledge that they are giants on behalf of their peers. They are true survivors on behalf of their brothers, sisters, mothers and those who did not make it this far. There is real hope for them that this will be the beginning of the end. It will never undo the damage that was done but we can acknowledge, address and learn from it. In that sense, the commission is only the end of the beginning because what happens next is the critical test of whether we are at an historic juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> There is a right way and a wrong way to do things. Yesterday, when Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan questioned the Taoiseach about unresolved issues relating to the Magdalen laundries, he talked around them too much. He tried to justify what was done by saying this was the first Government to look at this 60 year old crisis through the McAleese report and he said the Government parties had been listening carefully. However, by saying that, he proved he had not been listening carefully because the Justice for Magdalenes group has made the point well that the McAleese report was narrow in its remit and many of the issues the women need addressed remain to be addressed because the inquiry did not investigate the abuse and did not deal with burials and so on. I do not know whether this commission of inquiry will deal with these issues. While the Justice for the Magdalenes group says it has concerns, it will give evidence before the confidential committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The Minister has explained well that the terms of reference are flexible and are capable of being expanded. I accept that to a point but we should look at this project and not come up with the conclusion before we start. We have to inform the process and that is what the first part is about. That is a valid argument but a person does not need to be Sherlock Holmes to know that the Magdalen laundries and the ten outstanding institutions included in the amended terms of reference will turn up in this inquiry because they were part of the network that dealt with women and girls who had babies outside of marriage. On that basis, if the Government was listening, the Minister would include them now because if the commission is going to be what the Minister says it will be, it will deal with them anyway. That would be an important acknowledgement and I appeal to him to address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> The commission is a tribute to much of the work he has done in this regard and it has the potential to be a hugely important body of work. Experts have been assembled and, for example, Professor Mary Daly is unrivalled in her field and she can play a huge role in delivering an important social project on the history of women who had children outside wedlock. However, there are two dangers in that. The first is that by spending a great deal of time on history, it will be used as a cover to justify or legitimise bad behaviour that no history could ever condone because while we can say it was a sign of the times and attitudes are different now, it is only one side of the equation. People were more in awe of the Catholic hierarchy, women had fewer choices economically in raising children and it was a different time but that cannot be an excuse for the torture and cruelty perpetrated by individuals in those institutions. When we look at history and say we are all to blame and society is to blame, sometimes that means nobody is to blame and people do not get the justice they deserve. We have to factor that into the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> All these issues are relative but we must also recognise that it was not long ago that these events happened. When we use the hugely offensive term, "rehabilitation for women" in these cases, we talk about mother and baby homes when everybody knows a woman went in and she did not come out with a baby in most cases. The baby either did not make it or ended up in the hands of people claiming to be its natural parents or was adopted against the wishes of the mother. These issues need to be resolved. I echo the concerns about the adoption issue which is a huge body of work that needs to be addressed. I do not know whether the commission should do that but it needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> People have been hugely hurt and damaged by this. They have placed their trust in the Minister, which is an incredibly significant responsibility because their trust is precious. It has been abused and betrayed many times by people in this State and they cannot afford to have it abused again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_231">We used to consider the Famine the darkest moment in our history given the loss of life and the cruelty associated with the abundance of food available at the time while people starved. However, we know there have been much darker moments relating to industrial schools, Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, symphysiotomy, thalidomide and clerical abuse. There has been an appalling litany of tragedies and the one common denominator is the cruel and inhuman treatment of children and young women. We have had commissions of investigation, reports and a redress board but there were shortcomings in all the reports and people have been left dissatisfied. The same people have been let down in their lives year after year by their families, communities, institutions and the State. They still feel today that they have not received justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The first issue is the importance of getting this 100% right in order that there are no unanswered questions or outstanding issues following the commission of inquiry. It is hoped that the commission will be comprehensive enough to cover all this but there are concerns, one of which relates to the Magdalen laundries. There is a connection between them and mother and baby homes. I understand the concern that the commission will deal only with the role they played. Will that be sufficient? I note from the Minister's comments that article 15 provides that the commission will have regard to the facts established through previous inquires into related institutions. However, there are grave concerns about the outstanding issues following the McAleese report. While the remit was narrower, it did not take into account the 769 pages of testimony by women that were gathered by the Justice for Magdalenes group in which they expressed their pain and suffering. Any narrative has to honour the lives of those who lived in the institutions and how they were confined and treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">There are issues relating to that report including discrepancies between the length of stay as reported in the McAleese report and discrepancies with other electoral registers and grave records. There is also a need to look at those Magdalen ladies who moved to other institutions such as nursing homes and who died in those institutions. They are not considered Magdalen people. There were concerns that the pain and suffering of the women were not taken into account. I think there is a big area there for the commission. </p>
          <p eId="para_234"> We know that the connections between industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes so the natural conclusion is that they would be gathered. Should I finish and come back? </p>

          <p eId="para_239">Tomorrow, more than 700 secondary schools will close, which is very regrettable for students in particular, particularly those doing examinations. It is all because of the approach the Government originally took to junior cycle reform and in particular, the assessment dimension and the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, ignoring the recommendations of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the teachers in his original announcement and declarations. In the context of much of what he proposed, that did not work particularly well and the new Minister had to reverse quite a lot of what he suggested and his approach in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Such a strike does impact on students, particularly examination students. We are coming close to the pre-leaving certificate and pre-junior certificate examinations as well as the real examinations in May and June. This strike was avoidable. The essence of the issue is the credibility and integrity of the assessment system. Teachers have articulated the view that this would fundamentally impair and damage the relationship between teacher and student in the classroom. There is also a view out there that it could fatally undermine the integrity of the State assessment process. </p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I acknowledge and welcome the fact that there has been compromise but I made the point on the last occasion on which I raised this issue that this needed some fresh thinking and that people need to stand back and facilitate other approaches to resolving this issue. All stakeholders must be on board. The fundamental relationship in education and the learning process is the dynamic between the child and the teacher in the classroom. One cannot just ram it through as the former Minister tried to do and one cannot have preconditions around negotiations. </p>
          <p eId="para_242"> We have other examples where we successfully piloted curriculum reform in the past. The primary school curriculum, which was a very substantive reform in 1999, has been externally evaluated in terms of its impact and work because stakeholders were brought on board over time. Other reforms at senior cycle over the years have also worked in terms of the leaving certificate applied and other leaving certificate programmes as opposed to the mainstream leaving certificate so there is a way of doing this. The Government needs to change tack and, in particular, needs to acknowledge the very genuine and fundamental concerns teachers have in respect of the proposals before them. I ask the Taoiseach to speak with the Minister, to stand back and to look at a fresh approach to resolving this issue once and for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">Deputy Martin is right to raise the point, which he knows from his own experience, that the only people who suffer here are the students. It is of particular concern to them that a second day of strike is taking place tomorrow. Deputy Martin is also right when he says that the strike is avoidable. It is avoidable. The Minister has made it perfectly clear on more than one occasion that she is quite willing to engage further with and talk to teachers and teacher groups about this. This strike is still avoidable if the teachers should decide that this would be so and I ask that they would do so because the only people who suffer are the students.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> This is not a case of the Minister implementing by diktat the original proposal from the former Minister. She has compromised a good deal and has changed the nature of the first series of proposals from the former Minister. The junior certificate is an important part of a young person's life. The changes that are being made and the assessment methods that are being proposed by the Minister have taken into account what the teachers said about their relationship with the Department and Minister. I suggest that the people who are mostly discommoded here are students who are in many cases preparing for examinations later on in the year. The teachers should reflect on the changes and compromises the Minister has accepted from them and that what is on the table now is a series of very reasonable and achievable objectives which will enhance the status of teachers and the integrity of the examination. The Minister has gone out of her way on many occasions to say that she has listened carefully to teachers, has taken into account what they have said and has put a very different set of propositions on the table. Everybody should run with that. I ask that the strike be called off. </p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_245">The issue is that the Minister has brought us back to where we were three years ago because the original NCCA working group recommended a 60:40 divide with 60% being given to a written terminal examination and 40% being given to assessment. The former Minister just unilaterally ignored the NCCA working group and went off on his own singular move to say that we will abolish external certification and assessment in its entirety. He lost the teachers in the process. Three years later, the current Minister is essentially trying to regain lost ground. That is the net issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Nobody has any issue with the reform in terms of the content or substance of the learning processes or the idea of changing how we teach and learn across the junior certificate cycle. However, we should acknowledge that the assessment issue is an important principle because the ultimate fear is whether this will follow through to the leaving certificate and whether we will get a dumbed-down version of State assessment because national standards and a national curriculum are important. There are strengths the Irish education system has had. Key to underpinning those is a robust national certification programme and process. That can take many forms. I accept that nobody has a veto but no programme can be successfully or enthusiastically implemented if people are not enthusiastically engaged and on board. It is no fault of the Minister. I blame her predecessor. Much ground was lost in terms of rolling out this reform and getting it through because of the ham-fisted and appalling nature of its attempted implementation. </p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The Minister should stand back. There are other ways of cracking this. Other curricular reforms at senior certificate level, such as the leaving certificate applied, were introduced in other ways. The Minister should just stand back, stop saying "you have to be this or that", see whether we can get a working model that would satisfactorily resolve this and above all, prevent undue stress. It is stress for anyone doing the leaving certificate. </p>
          <p eId="para_248">They want to be in school and focus on their examination preparations. It is regrettable that we are again facing a strike. Rather than following the dictum or advice, I suggest the Government stand back and look at more creative ways of resolving the issue. That could be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">The Minister for Education and Skills did stand back to consider the proposals that were on the table. She engaged with the teachers, listened to them, took on board what they had said and changed the nature of the proposals. Change is always difficult to accept. It was not the Minister or the students who called the strike; it was called by the teachers. One element of what the Minister is proposing that is in the interests of teachers is the conditioning and demonstration of the assessment methods for the examinations. There is a strong element of national assessment in the junior certificate. As the Deputy is aware, it is an examination that has to evolve and change in the changing world in which we live. I agree that the strike is avoidable. Even today it can be avoided if the teachers take on board that the Minister has engaged with them and is willing to continue engaging with them. There is a changed element of assessment and support is being provided for teachers to do their jobs. It is about the quality of the students who can emerge from the process, the integrity of the examination system and the capacity of teachers to undertake this element of work. They know all of this. The changes being proposed by the Minister are reasonable and fair and the outcome of engaging and listening to the teachers. The strike is avoidable and the only ones who will suffer are the children and students. I ask teachers at this late stage to take this on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">As a lapsed teacher, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me that learning and education are pillars of society. Many of us, myself included, can point to a teacher or teachers who had a pivotal influence on us as we were pointed in certain directions in our lives' journeys. The teachers do not want to go on strike, but that is what will happen tomorrow, causing great disruption for students in particular, as well as for their families and teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The core of the issue, as the Taoiseach indicated, is reform of the junior cycle. It has boiled down to the key issue of teachers assessing their own students for certification purposes. Broadly, Sinn Féin supports all of the progressive reforms and proposals the Government has brought forward, except on the one issue of assessment. It makes sense that assessments should be impartial, external and standardised. The Minister has conceded that principle by saying teachers do not have to assess 60% of their students' work. We are in this bind because she insists on imposing a veto whereby teachers must assess 40% of their students' work. Sinn Féin agrees with the Minister's strategy of moving away from rote learning, but the intransigence shown on this issue has made a strike inevitable. The Taoiseach will acknowledge there needs to be agreement. Teachers are fundamental to how we progress. If they do not embrace this change, it will become a series of disruptions, especially for the young people involved. I ask the Taoiseach to review what he has said on the matter. We have tabled a Private Members' business motion on it and asked the Minister to review what she is doing, postpone further implementation of the junior cycle reform and return to the negotiating table to seek a reasonable agreed - not imposed - resolution of this important issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Teaching plays an important role in this regard. This is not a case of the Minister imposing by diktat something that has been considered. Compromise has been brought about because she has engaged with teachers and listened carefully to what they have had to say. I recently spoke to somebody from a country which had changed the entire structure of examinations to one where boxes were ticked and papers corrected by computer. That is not possible with an essay or under the structure in place here. The Minister has changed the proposal to assessment of 40% of a student's work. Teachers know their students better than anybody else and are professionals. Assessments by teachers cover 100% of work in a range of subjects in many other countries. Teachers here are being asked to assess 40% of the work done by their pupils. The training element included is very important in allowing teachers to do a professional job for their students. The strike is avoidable and could be called off today. It was not the students, the parents or the Minister who called the strike; it was called by the teachers. The proposals on the table are the consequence of the Minister having engaged and listened. She thinks the proposals are very reasonable and asks the teachers to proceed with them. She is always willing to engage with and listen to teachers' groups and unions. I appeal to them to call off the strike today. The students who were in the Visitors Gallery a few minutes ago do not want the strike to proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Why is the Taoiseach taking such a hardline stance? Teachers are the professionals. They are the folks who know about the matter. Given the bind we are in, the Minister will end up sitting down with the teachers. She will return to the negotiating table and the issue will in all likelihood be resolved at some point. We should listen to what the teachers are saying. The implication of the Taoiseach's reply is that in some way they do not want to do the extra work. That is not the case. I am concerned that the training and funding necessary for the proposed changes have not been provided. We stand on the principle that assessments should be external and standardised, but teachers of English are required to implement the framework for the junior cycle English specification after receiving only one day of in-service training. We should not take lightly the fact that 730 schools will close tomorrow. The principal responsibility for resolving the difficulties lies with the Government. The teachers have reiterated their support for a first-class junior cycle for all students, including a move away from reliance on final written examinations and the promotion of different types of assessment such as more practical project and portfolio work. Teachers are innovative in how they approach their work. It is not enough to say the Government or the students did not call the strike. We know that. This comes down to the Government digging in on a position - I do not know the basis for it - that teachers have to assess 40% of their students' work. Surely that is bridgeable. I again ask the Taoiseach to review his stance. This is the time for the Minister to try to avert the strike tomorrow. She should speak to the unions this afternoon and evening, listen to their fears and concerns and deliver on what they are saying.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">It is not a hardline stance. Everybody accepts that there is a need to change the structure of the junior certificate examinations. A number of proposals have been tabled during the years as to how this might happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">There is an evolution of change here for the junior certificate. The proposition on the table follows the Minister having listened very carefully to the teacher unions. If the teacher unions decide to call off the strike today, I am sure the Minister is willing to engage with them again if there an element of difference or something else they wish to put on the table.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">However, we must change the structure of it. The Deputy has made the point himself - I agree with him - that the responsibility does not just lie with the Government. The Deputy recognises the need for change and it cannot be changed without the co-operation, willingness and support of teaching professionals. What was on the table was an original proposition from the former Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and that has been changed by the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, having engaged with the teachers. These are young people who are doing their junior certificate examination and it is a system that must change. To assess 40% of the work of a junior certificate pupil is not beyond the professional competency of any teacher.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">While change is often difficult to accept, what we are doing is trying to provide the very best level of first examination process for students moving through secondary school. The Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and her people have spent hours engaging with unions and teachers on this change. It is a very progressive step in the right direction so that the integrity, quality, range and structure of that examination will be what we all want it to be; one that caters for the individual talents, competencies and levels of ability of students going through the junior certificate. If the unions decide today to issue a statement saying the strike is off, that will be welcomed by the Minister, and the many thousands of parents and students, particularly those doing examinations.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I welcome the recent announcement of job creation proposals by Government. The only problem I have is that after four years of the 31st Dáil it is inadequate. We are still in a dire situation and have one of the longest-standing and highest long-term unemployment rates in the European Union despite initiatives such as changes to the welfare system and more training for young people seeking work. Youth unemployment is rampant at 26%, which is unacceptably high. For every job created, five people have emigrated. We have seen that reality in particular in rural Ireland where many parishes and sporting organisations are decimated and do not have the necessary numbers to make up sporting teams. Many of the jobs that have been created are low paid or temporary and 25,000 people are attending activation schemes and classified as being employed notwithstanding that they are only on short-term training schemes in reality. It does not give a true indication of their status.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> An indicator is the number of people on social welfare benefits for a very long term of over three years. Over the past five years, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for more than three years has increased fourfold, or 300% in percentage terms. When figures on the very long-term jobless were first published in 2009, there were 25,000 people in the State who had been on jobseeker's benefit for more than three years. The figures for 2014 show that almost 100,000 were in this predicament, which is more than one in four people who are now on the dole for more than three years. One of the most significant problems for those on the long-term unemployment register is that it is self-perpetuating. People who are without a job for a long period are statistically less likely to find work as employers naturally favour those with suitable skills. The Government must pursue the matter relentlessly over the remaining term of the Dáil, in particular through the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the relevant Ministers of State. I call on the Government to pursue the matter more vigorously than it has in the past four years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_107">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_271">I thank Deputy Tom Fleming for his question and comments. He has put his finger on the central issue for Government and one of the twin pillars of the mandate it was given: to fix our public finances and put our country back to work. I agree with Deputy Fleming that when a person is out of work for more than a year, or for two years and longer, it becomes very difficult to get the individual to be motivated to want to go to work. There are a number of incentives in there. The emphasis of the Government as espoused on many occasions by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is to do everything possible from a Government perspective to ease entry into work, to make it attractive here for investment for the creation of jobs and so on. If one does not have stability, one cannot have confidence and if one does not have that, one will not have investment. If one does not have investment, one will not have jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Since the Government published the Action Plan for Jobs, 80,000 new jobs have been created. Unemployment has fallen for almost 30 months in a row from over 15% to just over 10%. While that is a radical improvement of more than 30%, it is still not sufficient. We must continue to focus as a Government on this particular problem as the best exit from poverty is the route through a job. That is why Government has changed the social protection services and established Intreo offices in every major town where the unemployed on the live register are profiled as being suitable for particular employers who are looking to expand their businesses. More than 130,000 people came off the live register last year and the Minister has introduced local employment offices in each local authority so that small businesses and medium enterprises can access all of the advice, information and assistance that is available to them for ease of employment or credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I note that 250,000 people lost their jobs as a consequence of the economic catastrophe that befell our country and many of them emigrated. Of those, 100,000 were from other countries, particularly in eastern Europe, who had come here to work in the construction sector. However, many of our own left and many still leave. I listened to an interview the other day with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the emphasis seemed to be that if one brought back young emigrants there might be a problem. We would welcome them back. I am glad to see that there is a rise not only in interest in coming back but in people returning here with skills and new experience, which is where we want to be. In respect of the long-term unemployed, there are incentives being put in place by Government such as the housing assistance payment and child benefit for those who are out of work for a period and who go back into a job. The social protection assistance they receive will not be cut off immediately, including medical cards and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> The Deputy makes the point and it is central to Government that we continue to focus on creating more jobs. Our ambition this year is to have 40,000 new jobs created in the course of 2015 and to have almost 500,000 people taken out of the requirement to pay the universal social charge. The emphasis from Government is on the hard pressed 30,000 to 70,000 and, strictly, on the creation of jobs. As a Deputy from Kerry, I note to Deputy Fleming that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has the approval of Government to spread the benefits of a rising economy throughout provincial and rural Ireland so that every town in time benefits from the creation of jobs. Nothing is more important in the lives of people than to have the stability of a good, well-paid job. That is where the continued focus and priority of Government will be for this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">Some of the schemes offer zero hour contracts, JobBridge positions or part-time work and they are unsustainable. Many people finish their training schemes further along the long-term unemployed list. The jobs are low-paid and insufficient. The IDA has fallen well short of its targets for attracting foreign investment, particularly in the regions outside Dublin and Cork cities. The IDA is putting all its resources and energy into getting larger companies to settle in these two areas and there is no focus on attracting smaller companies that would be better suited to the rural peripheral counties. My county, which the Taoiseach regularly visits and knows very well, received only three visits from the IDA in 2014. It is ridiculous. Several major employers in the county have been closed in recent years and nothing has been done to replace them. The county is an industrial wasteland, and we can see it in our towns, villages and communities where there has been major emigration, and allowing this to happen gives us no hope. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister personally to take it up with the IDA and ensure we get a better deal than we have had in the past ten years in particular.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_278">I disagree with Deputy Tom Fleming's comment that there is no hope at all. There is a proven record of stabilising and growing many sectors. For example, the Government reduced the VAT rate in the hospitality sector from 13.5% to 9%. It stabilised the industry and created another 25,000 jobs. We also abolished the travel tax and implemented the concept of the Wild Atlantic Way, with a direct impact on the Deputy's county. These are demonstrations of how the Government can benefit the creation of jobs and the economy throughout provincial Ireland. The intention is to spread it throughout the country. During our Presidency of the European Union, we negotiated a very strong programme for rural development, more than €2.5 billion, which awaits approval from the European Commission for the various programmes throughout the country. The abolition of milk quotas has had a very beneficial effect in terms of money flowing through the system for land acquisition and leasing. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has made a number of changes in the last two budgets to impact directly on the agriculture sector, which created more than 5,000 jobs last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> I disagree with the Deputy about the IDA. It is a world class model for the introduction of potential investors to this country and the pipeline is very strong, with 15,000 gross, or 7,500 net, new jobs created last year. It is held up to be one of the foremost organisations of its kind globally. Our talent pool, the tax system we now have, with the ending of the stateless concept and the double Irish, our technology and our track record are second to none. Enterprise Ireland deals with small and medium enterprises, where the emphasis is on growing all those numbers on the backs of small companies that are able to export or service multinationals while they are here. The approval of the Connect Ireland scheme for very small operators could benefit any county. The scheme incentivises people from Ireland who are working for companies outside the EU that want to invest in Europe to connect the company with our country. Far from being despondent, I see 2015 and beyond as years of great opportunity, and the Government will focus relentlessly on making it more attractive for more jobs to be created.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">It is not agreed. We were given an Order of Business earlier today and the Taoiseach read out a revised Order of Business, which we received only a moment ago. This is regarding a very important issue, the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters. We have consistently raised these issues with the Taoiseach. Na Teachtaí Ó Caoláin, McLellan and McDonald raised these issues this morning and we put down a comprehensive amendment to the Government's proposition. Did the Government change the Order of Business because it cannot fill the speaking slots? We will fill the slots, as will others here. For how long is it to be adjourned and why is it to be adjourned? It is not a good way to do business to give us the Order of Business and then revise it without any explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The people involved are mostly women, although some men are involved and many of them were children at the time. They are hanging on, waiting for the Government to do the right thing, to fulfil the apology the Taoiseach made here on behalf of the citizens of the State. We strenuously object to the cack-handed way the Taoiseach is dealing with the issue and the way he has revised the Taoiseach's programme without any explanation whatsoever. He did not even explain it when he was on his feet. Sinn Féin is prepared to fill the speaking slots, if that is the problem. I am sure other Teachtaí would be happy to come and speak on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">There is no difficulty about this. As Deputies Adams and Martin have raised, it is an important matter. It is important that people who wish to speak on it should be given time. The Chief Whip has informed me that he has another list of Members who wish to speak - I did not have a contribution to speak on it myself - so the explanation is that there are more speakers who wish to contribute to this important issue. The intention then is to adjourn today at 4 p.m. and bring it back in next week in order that everyone who wishes to speak will have the opportunity to so do. It is an important issue and I accept the claims from Deputies opposite on many occasions that more time should be given. That is what this is about and more time will be given.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">The Taoiseach will be aware that the price of oil has decreased dramatically in the past few months. However, the consumer, on a range of levels, has yet to receive the proportionate reduction in the price of oil or petrol and the view of the regulator appears to be that he has no role in terms of pricing. It is a serious issue that when prices increase the consumer feels it very quickly but the same does not happen when prices decrease. As I said, oil prices have decreased dramatically. When will the Road Transport Bill and Public Transport Bill come before the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Furthermore, rent prices across Dublin have increased, on average, by 20%, which is a substantial increase. This is having a huge impact on those who rent their homes, including many families. This extraordinary increase in rents when combined with the type of accommodation which people can access under the terms of the rent supplement scheme is having a devastating impact on low income families, leaving many in poor housing or facing eviction and homelessness. When will the landlords and tenants Bill be introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach about a number of pieces of legislation in the health area. Section C of the legislative programme for the spring-summer session includes 12 Bills in the health area, the status of the majority of which is, "Publication Expected - Not possible to indicate at this stage". I am speaking in this regard about the health reform Bill, which is to put in place the new structures for the health service; the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (amendment) Bill, which is to amend the functions and membership of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the New Children's Hospital Establishment Bill, which is to establish a statutory body to provide paediatric acute services in Dublin. In all cases, the status is "Not possible to indicate at this stage". The status of the nursing home support scheme (Amendment) Bill, an important issue in terms of the Lourdes hospital redress scheme is "Publication Expected - 2015". In regard to the public health (retail licensing of tobacco products) Bill, which deals with a licensing system and other measures in relation to the sale of tobacco products and non-medicinal nicotine delivery systems, including e-cigarettes, the status is "Publication Expected - Not possible to indicate at this stage". While licensing of any new drug goes through a lengthy process in terms of FDA, Irish Medicines Board and European Medicines Agency approval and new foods are regulated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, e-cigarettes-----</p>

          <p eId="para_443">For the information of the House, today the Government made an historic decision in approving the wording of the thirty-fourth amendment to the Constitution Bill which will allow the people to decide the question of equality of marriage which, in turn, will allow for the right of two people to marry, irrespective of their sexual orientation. This is the first time a people’s constitutional convention has made a recommendation that has been accepted by a Government. Once the Bill passes through the House, the issue will be put to the people for their decision. In that sense, it is an historic day.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The Deputy raised the issue of energy prices and the energy regulator. I am glad that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, will meet the energy companies. He will support the opportunity for energy companies to pass on the reduction in the cost of oil and so forth to consumers. The regulator has also spoken about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The road transport Bill will be published in the second half of the year. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> I do not have a date for publication of the landlord and tenant Bill. The question of rent caps will be dealt with when the supply of housing is adequate to meet demand. That is why the Government has prioritised not only putting up money for but also incentivising opportunities to get the construction sector going. Deputy Micheál Martin can shake his head, but that is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">Tá cúpla ceist agam ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill and the health Bill. Dúirt an tAire, an Teachta Heather Humphreys, seachtain ó shin go mbeidh Bille foilsithe i gceann cúpla seachtain. An féidir leis an Taoiseach a chinntiú go dtarlóidh sé seo? Tá plean an Rialtais chun níos mó Gaeilgeoirí a fhostú sa Státseirbhís ina phraiseach anois. Tá sé scannalach go bhfuil sé ráite ag ochtar Airí, ina measc an tAire rialtais áitiúil, an Teachta Alan Kelly, nach bhfuil gá le daoine le Gaeilge ina Ranna. Is léir nach bhfuil an Taoiseach ná an Rialtas dáiríre faoin nGaeilge. Cén uair a bheidh an Bille ag teacht roimh an Dáil?</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Tá ceist an-tábhachtach eile agam. Yesterday I raised the matter of the lack of a guiding timeframe for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to accept Opposition amendments on the remaining Stages of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Recently I referred to a letter from HIQA, Health Information and Quality Authority, and recommendations it had made about health services in Drogheda but which had not been implemented by the Minister for Health or the HSE. I have written to the Minister about this matter, but I have not received an answer from him. I got back in touch with HIQA which informed me that recommendations made about national emergency departments which had not been implemented included the issues of emergency department services, emergency department clinical governance and emergency department management performance and information. It is not much of a surprise that we have such a crisis in the health service which has been exacerbated by the cut in the number of nurses. Is there a health (amendment) Bill pending to deal with these serious failings?</p>

          <p eId="para_453"> Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil an reachtaíocht i dtaobh stádas oifigiúil na Gaeilge agus úsáid na Gaeilge anseo ar an gcéad liosta don seisiún seo. Ní ró-fhada a bheidh an tAire ag tabhairt an Bhille isteach. Tabharfaidh mé dáta cinnte don Teachta nuair a bheidh a fhios agam féin faoi. Tá an Bille curtha síos chun teacht isteach sa seisiún seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The hospital in Drogheda did put an action plan in place following HIQA’s 2012 report. It did bring about an improvement in the emergency department's performance in 2013. Clearly, there are significant problems in Drogheda in community services, but there are plans to address these. I spoke to the services and the Deputy will receive a response on the letter he received from HIQA.</p>

            <p eId="para_468">This is a very serious issue, not just for my own constituency, but for adjoining constituencies North and South of the Border. Last week, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, in a very important article by Jim Cusack, pointed out that there is significant pollution of the drinking water supply to parts of counties Monaghan and Louth, particularly the River Fane in Dundalk. The article states that up to 60,000 homes are served by water from this lake. The problem is that vile, carcinogenic substances, put in, as the article states, by former or present members of the IRA, are coming into the water. They are poisoning the environment. It has the potential to kill, in terms of the toxicity itself, and to pollute the water supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> We need to deal with it under two headings. The first is to deal with the public health issue. Will the Minister bring the urgent need to test all the drinking water supplies from these sources to the attention of the Department of Health, his own Department, the EPA and the Northern Ireland authorities? We must be reassured that there is no threat to public health and that neither is there a long-term threat caused by the carcinogens identified by the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, which can affect children in the womb and the genetic material people have at birth. The key issue is to reassure them. Louth County Council reassured the public yesterday on that matter, but there is deep long-term concern about this, because this criminality has been going on for many years. It is an absolute disgrace.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Second, the political solution is for the Minister, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Minister for Health to get together with their colleagues in the North, because the pollution in this case is in South Armagh.</p>

            <p eId="para_475">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this most important issue. The fact that Oireachtas representatives from Cavan-Monaghan and Louth are in the Chamber to speak on the matter illustrates and underlines the gravity and seriousness of the situation. The report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that the water supply for Dundalk was being contaminated came as a shock to many people in the town and surrounding areas. A population of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 is supplied directly from this modern water supply system. I understand the Cavan Hill facility was put in place in the late 1980s and that pumping and water extraction from the River Fane occurs at Stephentown Bridge. It was an urgent and much-needed supply at the time it was built. The survey work ordained that the Lough Ross and Lough Muckno catchment would be the ideal source and that the River Fane would carry the water towards Dundalk until it was extracted from the river. The Lough Muckno and Lough Ross water source is vital to the town's current and future needs. It is not only important for the domestic supply needs of the population in the area as the prospect of industrial development in the town will be dictated and determined by the availability of a good quality constant dependable water source.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> The suggestion that diesel sludge was seeping into the streams flowing into the Muckno catchment came as a bolt from the blue. The Environmental Protection Agency must descend on the area immediately. Forensic testing of water quality must be undertaken and must be continued on a regular basis to provide reassurance for the consumers. At a meeting of Louth County Council last Monday the officials provided some reassurance to members, but the reality is that these toxins are flowing into the river and there is a cumulative effect. In the longer term there will be serious implications for users and consumers.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Conlan<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_477">This is an important issue and it has been ongoing for many years. The report in the newspaper last Sunday did us a service because it highlighted the fact that the samples taken at Lough Muckno near Castleblayney, County Monaghan, were over 8,000 times above safe limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> If there are carcinogenic toxins contained in the water supply we should not have to rely on a newspaper to provide us with that information. The EPA should be undertaking daily tests until the problem is resolved and the people responsible are dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> People are fearful about the effect this is having on their families and health. It is not a new problem; it has been ongoing for many years but it has not been tackled or dealt with to date. It is important, therefore, that daily tests are carried out and proper information is given to the public. The public are scared at the moment and they do not know what is going on. Save for the information supplied in the newspaper report we would still be in the dark about the level of toxins in the water. According to reports, some of the toxins cause heart malformations in children and premature delivery. These are serious issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> There are approximately 10,000 people in the catchment area in south Armagh and a further 40,000 people in the Dundalk area directly affected by the pollution in Lough Ross and the Fane river. Furthermore, Lough Muckno is a major amenity in the area and an area of natural beauty in Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_481"> People are concerned. Acid sludge is being dumped alongside riverbanks in containers on a regular basis. It is costing the county councils in Louth and Monaghan vast amounts of money to deal with the problem. The lack of information provided to the general public on the level of toxins in the river and the water supply is concerning. Immediate action should be taken by the EPA to provide information to the public on a daily basis. If there is a discharge into Lough Muckno, Lough Ross or the Fane river it will have an immediate effect on the quality of the water supply. We need updated information on a regular basis from the EPA. The agency must get on top of this problem, find out where it is coming from and determine the source. Action needs to be taken by the authorities on both sides of the Border to deal with this matter immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important matter. The report in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>was alarming and is of serious concern to people in the north east. The report contained details of fuel smugglers pumping massive volumes of toxic waste linked to cancers and abnormalities in unborn babies into water supplies in our State. The highly respected security correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, Mr. Jim Cusack, has done a good service by outlining in great detail these irregularities. As my colleagues have stated already, it is frightening to think that this waste is being pumped into major waterways, such as Lough Muckno and Lough Ross in County Monaghan as well as the Fane river. The report contained details of a sample of water taken by a representative of the Sunday Independent which was shown to contain 8,000 times more chemical pollution than clean drinking water. It is frightening and absolutely unacceptable. The agencies of the State must take every action possible to put a stop to this hideous behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> Those of us living in the Border counties know about the additional costs to local authorities as a result of cleaning up roadways where people illegally smuggling diesel have spilt it as well as the vast cost to the Exchequer. To my knowledge, the agencies in our State, whether an Garda Síochána or the Revenue Commissioners, have been most diligent in pursuing this illegal activity. I hope that the authorities North of the Border are as diligent in pursuing these criminals and gangsters, who are doing untold damage to the people and the country's environment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_484">I thank all of the Deputies for raising this serious matter. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. Like the Deputies who have spoken, I am also concerned about the reports of alleged pollution discharge at Lough Ross, County Armagh, entering the River Fane system. As we all know, this is the primary source of the drinking water supply for Dundalk. Deputies have referred to media coverage to date, which has covered the losses to the Exchequer as a result of this illegal fuel laundering as well as losses to the taxpayer and the loss to individuals who have had their engines and cars wrecked. However, the issue has been elevated to a far more significant level now, as outlined by the Deputies, because of the very real threat to human health that this alleged pollution could potentially cause. My Department and I recognise that this is a serious issue. It is totally unacceptable and should concern all Deputies of all sides in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> I understand that Louth County Council on behalf of Irish Water has already contacted the water pollution inspectorate in Northern Ireland to investigate this specific allegation. The council carries out regular sampling at various properties throughout the water distribution system for Dundalk and drinking water sample results for 2014 are fully compliant with the drinking water regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts carry a general prohibition on the entry of any polluting matter to waters. Any persons causing or permitting polluting matter to enter waters is liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €15 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both. The primary responsibility of ensuring prevention of water pollution rests with local authorities, which are, in turn, supervised by the EPA for this purpose. Water inspections account for about half of all local authority inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_487"> Local authorities issue hundreds of enforcement notices every year under section 12 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, as well as section 23 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act 1990. These enforcement notices require respondents to carry out actions to prevent or remedy water pollution. They are followed up by prosecutions where necessary. Prosecutions are also taken for allowing polluting matter to enter waters or in respect of licensable discharges.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> Enforcement relating to illegal diesel laundering activities is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view of avoiding loss of revenue to the Exchequer. However, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation. This role involves taking the necessary measures on behalf of the State to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment and, in particular, without risk to water.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">I assure the Deputies present that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will assist the local authorities and the EPA to take whatever steps are necessary to stamp out this illegal practice which, as the Deputies have outlined, is a threat to human health.</p>
            <p eId="para_490"> Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities since 2008 and to date the Department has reimbursed all of the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. Almost half of the clean-up operations have taken place in County Louth alone with 596 incidents having been dealt with there at a cost of approximately €4.8 million to the State. This is significant expenditure, borne at present by the environment fund. The Department, as part of ongoing co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities on the repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held recent discussions with authorities in Northern Ireland on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-Border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are ongoing. </p>
            <p eId="para_491"> A complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co­ordinated enforcement of the law from both a Revenue and waste management perspective. The Minister has committed to meeting his counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Minister for the Environment, Mark Durkan, MLA, to highlight the problems being faced in the Border counties represented by the Deputies here today. This is a matter of the most serious concern for the Department and I assure Deputies that the Minister is treating this as a matter of priority. He will be taking this issue up with his Northern Ireland colleagues and urging them to give it the same priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_492">I wish to correct one thing the Minister of State said - it is not "alleged" pollution. While I appreciate that he did not write the reply, it is not "alleged" but real pollution. It is measured, shown in the video and it is a disgrace, as the Minister of State said. I agree with the action the Minister is taking in meeting his colleague in the North. However, we need to go further. As representatives of two different constituencies South of the Border, we should meet the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland, Mr. Durkan. That will show that it is not just the administration which is rightly and properly fully engaged in this. We, as Members of the Oireachtas, say "No" to the pollution of our drinking water and "No" to the poisons that are being discharged into the water supply for Dundalk. Deputy Kirk is exactly right on that. We are also saying "No" to the extremely negative effects on the future of our environment and the creation of jobs. I would suggest that we get together afterwards, meet the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and go up North to meet the Minister, Mark Durkan, MLA, and the public representatives from south Armagh to view the situation on the ground and to say, "Let it end forever". That is what this is about - finishing it off for good.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">I concur with Deputy O'Dowd and if a meeting is arranged with the politicians who have collective responsibility in this area, l certainly will attend. This is a vitally important issue that must be addressed urgently. It seems to me that there is a need for more co-ordination of the various agencies with specific and less specific responsibilities in this area. A structure must be put in place to ensure that there is tight, effective and efficient co-ordination of their work. This is a large water scheme and the distance between Castleblayney, Stephenstown Bridge and Cavan Hill is considerable. The river is flowing, with streams flowing into both Lough Muckno and Loch Ross, which means that the potential for pollution coming from different sources is quite significant. We need a monitoring guardian angel arrangement for the supply catchment and the river and a constant monitoring of the quality of the water.</p>

The Minister of State said in his reply that the sample was taken from south Armagh but it was not; it was taken in Castleblayney in County Monaghan. Therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of our Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the EPA. I want them to be on the ground, checking out the river where the pollution took place to determine exactly the cause of the problem. These are not just allegations - there is video evidence and samples were taken and tested. The test results confirmed that there were over 8,000 times the safe limits for toxic pollutants in the water in that location. It would be very helpful if the Minister visited the area immediately to see exactly what is going on. It would also be very helpful if the Deputies from both constituencies and the representatives from south Armagh were on the ground too, with both Ministers, to get a proper handle on the situation. As we have said, it has been going on for far too long. It is very concerning and we should not have to depend on newspaper reports to get information.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">It has been estimated that the revenue loss to our State amounts to approximately €150 million per annum. That is probably an underestimation, given the extent of this illegal activity over the past number of years. The Fianna Fáil councillor P.J. O'Hanlon, from south Monaghan, told me that he has had numerous calls from people in the Castleblayney area who are very concerned about this. Councillor Padraig McNally has also had numerous calls and I am sure every other public representative in south Monaghan will report the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> I concur with Deputy O'Dowd's suggestion that the public representatives, North and South, in the affected areas should meet. I would also suggest, in reference to the proposed meeting between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and the Northern Ireland Minister for the Environment, Mr. Durkan, that they should have a high-level meeting involving the Garda Síochána, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts North of the Border as well. We must be assured that the agencies North of the Border are as diligent in pursing this illegal activity as our authorities have been. Over the years this has been a matter of absolute frustration for all of us. Apart from the very important issues of the loss of revenue to the State and the fact that illegal activity is going on, in many instances money has been used to clean up roads to make them safe after diesel spillages when that money could have been put to far better use. God knows how many accidents have happened as a result of diesel spilled on our roads, causing injuries to many people. This is an issue that must be prioritised and dealt with in the most urgent manner possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">Deputies have already outlined the seriousness of this issue, which is a fundamental threat to human health in the Border counties. I recognise that and I reiterate that the Minister will be raising this issue as a matter of priority with the Northern Ireland Executive and with the Minister for the Environment, Mr. Durkan. It will also be raised at the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which is welcome. All agencies must come together to stamp out this horrendous activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> Again, I reassure Deputies that Louth County Council has carried out regular sampling at various properties throughout the water distribution system for Dundalk. The drinking water sample results for the Dundalk public water supply scheme for 2014 for PAHs show that it is fully compliant with the drinking water regulations. The river water results taken at the Dundalk water supply abstraction point on the River Fane during 2014 showed that COD was less than 40 mg/l during the year and therefore was compliant with the quality of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water regulations. The drinking water samples for Dundalk town and environs have all been compliant with the drinking water regulations of 2013 with the exception of one instance of lead detection. The investigation of this lead non-compliance showed that there was no lead on the public side of the public water supply. </p>
            <p eId="para_500"> While tackling the problem of diesel laundering and the subsequent waste which arises is both challenging and costly, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is committed to working with the authorities on both sides of the Border to deliver more effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law. The multi-agency approach for which Deputies are calling, whereby all of the relevant agencies would bring their skills and expertise together and apply them to the task at hand, is the best approach to tackling this irresponsible and dangerous environmental crime. </p>

            <p eId="para_503">Deputy Martin Ferris and I raise the issue of the absence of nursing and medical support for the residents of the island of Inishturk off the County Mayo coast. Inishturk Island has a population of 58. When the resident nurse retired plenty of notice was given but no replacement was recruited. The island does not currently have a nurse and despite a promise of weekly visits, only three such visits have taken place since last September.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> The population of Inishturk Island has the same health concerns that affect everyone living on the mainland. Some residents have contracted influenza, one woman is pregnant and many other islanders are elderly. They have been informed that a nurse has been recruited to the vacant position but certain paperwork remains outstanding. When will the appointee be <i>in situ</i>? As Inishturk is nine miles offshore, its population has great concerns that an emergency may present. The state-of-the-art health centre on the island is locked up and residents do not have access to the defibrillator located in the centre in the event of a cardiac emergency presenting. </p>
            <p eId="para_505"> I urge the Minister to ensure the population of Inishturk is provided with this most essential support in the interest of their ongoing health concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_506">As Deputy Ó Caoláin stated, Inishturk Island has 58 inhabitants, most of whom are elderly, with the age ranging from nine to 97 years. The island does not have a public health nurse. One of the residents is pregnant and a number of others suffer from diabetes and heart problems. The island also has a state-of-the-art medical centre. The resident nurse retired in September 2014 and the Health Service Executive was informed of the forthcoming retirement in December 2013. Since the nurse's retirement in September last, a public health nurse has made three visits to the island. Last week, the residents were told it was hoped to have a nurse in place shortly. While a replacement was recruited in November, the Health Service Executive is awaiting vetting clearance and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> Deputy Gerry Adams received a reply on 3 February 2014 which stated the HSE was in the process of recruiting a nurse to cover Inishturk Island due to a retirement. It noted that while the process was taking place, the island would be covered on a whole-time basis. This letter was received almost 12 months ago, yet the issue has still not been addressed. It is an indictment of the health service that people living on an island nine miles off the coast are dependent on emergency services if they require medical attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> It is Government policy that islands must be afforded health services on a par with their counterparts on the mainland. It is obvious that Inishturk Island is being discriminated against through the failure since September 2014 to implement that policy. It is a disgrace that any system would allow 58 people to have no medical cover or assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">Deputy Ferris will have to find different language to describe this issue because the word "disgrace" should not be used in this context. While I agree that people living in an exposed and isolated area deserve the same type of health service as everyone else in the community, the issue the Deputies raise is not the result of a deliberate action. Given the difficulty being experienced in recruiting nurses in large towns and cities, recruiting a nurse for an isolated area, as beautiful as Inishturk may be, clearly will present a difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> The delivery of a sustainable community nursing service which effectively meets the health needs of the population in a primary care setting is the principal aim of the Health Service Executive's public health nursing service. The nursing post on Inishturk Island became vacant recently when the island's nurse retired. The HSE has advised that there are no service or budget reduction elements relating to this issue. Finding a suitably qualified candidate who wanted to live and work on Inishturk was a significant challenge. A nurse has been recruited to take up the position and the successful candidate is undergoing pre-employment checks. As part of this process, the appointed nurse must obtain occupational health clearances. As soon as these have been completed, the nurse will be in a position to take up the appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> No one, including the two Deputies opposite, would suggest that a person, however qualified, should be allowed to work in a community without pre-employment checks first being carried out. While waiting on the new nurse to take up her position, residents have been advised to contact their general practitioner directly if they have any health issues. I am sure they will have done this as a matter of course. </p>
            <p eId="para_512"> I will check the position regarding the weekly visits the Deputies indicated had been promised. The HSE is conscious of the need to provide appropriate health services for island communities. In this regard, it has committed in its 2015 operational plan to conduct a review of primary care island services, with a completion timeframe of the second quarter of 2015. Plans are in train to develop terms of reference and to establish a working group to proceed with this. </p>
            <p eId="para_513"> With transport and communications improving, I hope people will move to more isolated islands and residents will have more children. This will require a different response. I am conscious of the issues that arise and thank the Deputies for raising the matter. The news concerning a nurse for Inishturk Island is good. That a nurse has not been<i> in situ </i>before now was not intentional.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">With respect, the Minister of State is not living nine miles offshore on an island in the Atlantic. When she refers to people contacting a general practitioner directly, she should note that they are dependent on other means of communication. It is not quite the same as the access she and I enjoy living on the mainland. Her answer is not adequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> On pre-employment checks, when was the successful person identified and how long will the pre-employment checks take? When will a final decision be taken on the suitability of the new recruit to take up this opportunity on Inishturk Island? </p>
            <p eId="para_518"> In the interim, the services of a nurse from the adjacent Clare Island were to be used and she was to visit Inishturk Island weekly. Is that the case as this information does not correspond with the information available to us? We have been informed that only three visits have taken place since last September. Will the Minister of State clarify whether these visits are taking place weekly? The concerns raised are understandable given the circumstances Deputy Martin Ferris and I have described, including the age profile of residents, the presence of a pregnant woman on the island and the fact that islanders are no more immune to influenza than the rest of us, wherever we may live. Will the Minister indicate precisely when it is hoped the nurse will take up duties?</p>

            <p eId="para_520">The importance of having somebody present on the island in the case of emergency cannot be overstated.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> What I find very disturbing is the reply from the HSE in Castlebar. This dates back to December 2013. When the HSE was approached about having a nurse in place, the residents' representative, Ms Mary Heanue, the co-ordinator on Inishturk, was told clearly that a nurse was not needed as there was no one in need of dressing full-time, there were no pregnant ladies on the island and there was nobody who needed injections. The HSE also made reference to the fact it did not have the resources necessary, whether it be personnel or otherwise, to fill the vacuum.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> In November 2014 a nurse was recruited and is being vetted, which means, as we are almost into February, that it has taken four months to complete the recruitment. It is inexcusable that there is nobody in place yet. I am not blaming the Minister of State for this. At the end of the day, the ability of the HSE to provide medical care for people in need leaves an awful lot to be desired, in particular for those living in rural areas.</p>

I said the HSE had advised that there were no service or budget reduction elements relating to this issue. The nurse was recruited. It was a difficult process and I understand that difficulty because we have had a similar difficulty in looking for nurses in areas in which there has been major development. The pre-employment checks that need to be made in the case of every person employed in the medical profession are good. Yes, they take time, but it is important that they happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> I am not certain about this nurse's personal circumstances, but it may, for example, be someone who was living abroad. What I am certain of is that a nurse has been recruited and it will be a great relief to the HSE, me and, I assume, the people of Inishturk to have someone available to them 24-7. That is what is of central importance and it is happening. While I do not have the information on the starting date sought by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I will send it to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_525">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to take this debate. </p>
            <p eId="para_526"> The fair deal scheme was introduced on the basis of the core principle that long-term care should be affordable and that a person should receive the same level of support, whether he or she chooses a public, voluntary or private nursing home. The scheme was envisaged as enabling people in need of long-term nursing care and their families to access such care in a timely and cost-effective manner. It should be acknowledged that the fair deal scheme benefits a significant number of older people and is a considerable improvement on the level of support available under the previous subvention scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> We need to see an increase in the funding for the fair deal scheme which I understand stands at approximately €963 million. There is a cost argument as we are spending too much money in keeping qualified persons in hospital beds. However, there is also a compassion argument which is more important and compelling. It is costing taxpayers more than €500,000 a day, or €4 million a week, to keep qualifying persons in hospital beds, waiting for funding for a fair deal scheme nursing home bed. There are 2,135 people waiting just over 15 weeks for approval under the scheme. While that number fluctuates, the overall statistics point to a fourfold increase in waiting list numbers since January 2014, when some 500 people were on the list for an average period of just four weeks. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the increased waiting time in processing fair deal scheme applications is a contributory factor in the overcrowding crisis in accident and emergency departments in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> It is a very emotional time for a family when they have to move a loved one into a nursing home; it is never an easy time. However, the current position is compounding the problem as the funding caps under the scheme are impacting on the processing time for applications and the waiting time for a suitable permanent placement. In summary, the funding cap placed on the fair deal scheme is adding to the crisis in accident and emergency departments, which is having a knock-on effect for patients, families and the overall cost of running the health service. It is my considered view that the fair deal scheme needs to be demand-led.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">I also thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to deal with this issue. Her dedication to the task of providing world class services for the elderly is not in doubt. </p>
            <p eId="para_530"> How we treat the elderly is a fair mark of our society. They were the creators of the society and systems we now enjoy. They worked hard, often for low pay, paid their taxes and are now entitled to the best care that can be provided, if possible in their own homes and, where that is not possible, in available care facilities of high standard. It is not acceptable that the elderly are left in acute hospital beds when what they need is nursing home care. It is not acceptable that they are left in their homes where they can no longer be adequately cared for.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The fair deal scheme is just that - a good deal for those who need nursing home care. This excellent scheme was intended to be - I emphasise this point - demand-led where the service would be provided when required. The current practice, inherited by the Minister of State, whereby the scheme is capped financially, leads to inevitable delays in the service being provided and real hardship for the elderly persons left waiting. I am asking that the resources needed to provide a demand-led service be provided by the Government and that the waiting for essential care for long periods be ended. Senior citizens deserve no less.</p>

            <p eId="para_532">I thank Deputies Brendan Ryan and Emmet Stagg for raising this issue which is very pertinent at this time, given that we are in prolonged discussions with various Departments and desperately trying to do what they are asking for. As they rightly pointed out, the nursing homes support scheme provides financial support for those who require long-term nursing home care, with residents contributing a portion of the cost in accordance with their means, which is essential. It is a scheme which relieves families of potentially very onerous expense and even protects the greater part of the value of a participant's main residence. However, it is also expensive. The amount allocated to the scheme in 2015 is €948.8 million. Again, demographic trends mean that the scheme is under pressure because of the increasing numbers of older people in the population. The number of the population over 65 years is growing by approximately 20,000 each year and the population over 80 years which has the greatest need in terms of utilisation of health services is growing by some 4% per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> The scheme is demand-led but, as Deputy Emmet Stagg rightly pointed out, resource-capped. In the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 a provision was included in order to ring-fence the funding for the scheme and ensure it was used for the provision of financial support under the scheme. To manage the available funds through the year, the HSE operates a national placement list in order of when applications are approved, which is very important, and funding is released in strict chronological order as it becomes available. As of 16 January, there are 1,313 people on the placement list, with an average waiting time of 11 weeks, down in some cases from 17 and 18 weeks. The budget for the scheme in 2015 is €948.8 million, an increase of €10 million on the figure for 2014. Some €10 million allocated to the scheme related to the delayed discharges initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> I will forward this reply in full to both Deputies, but I believe we need to talk about some other issues concerning the fair deal scheme. For example, the review of the scheme which I expect to receive in the next few weeks will tell us that it is unsustainable in its current financial make-up, given the demands on it. What it should tell us and what I would like it to tell us is that people will be able to access the fair deal scheme in the community, rather than having to avail of long-stay nursing home care, if that is their preference.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">It is about preference and choice. I would hate to think that because I had reached a certain age and despite the fact I was capable of making these choices myself, my choices would be limited. We also need to look seriously at the issue of capacity. Even if we could provide a fair deal scheme place for everybody in hospital who needed one, there are certain areas of the country where we do not have the capacity to move patients from hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> I am a great believer in identifying difficulties and finding solutions. If the fair deal scheme was resource and demand-led, it would provide comfort for both the public and private sectors and deliver more of the beds we so desperately need. The fair deal scheme must be a combination of the two options. It must be about choices in the community and ensuring that if people are offered a bed, it is in an the area close to where they live and those who might wish to visit them. For example, if the patient is in Naas or Kildare, the bed offered should not be in some place that is inaccessible to him or her such as in Waterford. We need a full and wider debate on this issue. We understand the difficulties, but we need to come up with perhaps different solutions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_537">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response which demonstrates the control she has of this brief. I agree fully that making the fair deal scheme demand-led would provide an incentive to provide a further supply of long-term beds to meet the additional capacity required. We know that there is the demand, but like the housing market, part of the problem is supply. The budgetary cap acts as a disincentive for investors in the private sector and adopting a demand-led approach would be of benefit and help to achieve a better supply. We have a scheme that is fair, but it can work better. We need more investment in it and a greater supply of beds, be they in the public, private or voluntary sector. We are in economic recovery, but this recovery should be felt by all, particularly those who are most vulnerable. The people who qualify for the fair deal scheme are predominantly elderly. I agree fully with the Minister of State on the importance of choice. There should not be just one solution for those in need of care. Where people need security and comfort that cannot be provided by family members, they will certainly not be found in hospital wards.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> I thank the Minister of State for her sterling work in this area, but I must ask: why has the scheme been designed in such a way that it is not demand-led? She has responded to this question and obviously the cost of the scheme in recent times has been a significant factor. If we are entering recovery, this area is one in which we should see the benefits of that recovery.</p>

            <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_539">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with this issue. The medical card system which is far more expensive than the fair deal scheme is entirely demand-led. If a person qualifies for a medical service, he or she receives that service, with no waiting time for access. Nobody says in November that all of the money is gone and that a service cannot be provided. The system should be similar to that for the fair deal scheme. If people qualify, the service should be provided when needed. I believe the Minister of State agrees with us on that point.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> Has any calculation been made of the extra funding that would be required, over and above the current figure of €900 million, to fill the gap in order that the scheme would be demand-led and a service provided as required? Will the Minister of State also ensure the HIQA beds in the public sector are upgraded to the point where they would no longer be under threat? I understand there is a period of grace in which this could be done and that she is in the process of doing this. It is important that these beds are retained in the system in order that there will be no shortage of resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">I could not agree more with the Deputies. I have made it clear that we cannot afford to lose any bed, private or public, for older people. In regard to the fair deal scheme, we also need to look at the issue of funding and the notion that if one lives in Dublin, X amount is paid per bed, while the rate is different if one lives in Wicklow or Galway. No account is taken of the needs of the person concerned. We need to look at this issue because the needs of some people are greater than those of others and they need more care and attention. We need to look seriously at the range of needs involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> On the issue of cost, I am told that if we were to make the scheme resource and demand-led, it would cost an additional €30 million a year. In some years the cost would be higher and in others lower. However, if we do not do this in a planned way and a way we can see what we will be doing six months down the road, the cost will be twice that figure or more. It is about planning and ensuring we know exactly where we will find capacity and how we will meet demand as it arises.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">The point I was making before the debate was adjourned was that I hoped the commission would not be the same as others and issue reports which would leave issues unaddressed and people dissatisfied and waiting for justice. I hope there will be enough flexibility and leeway for the commission to go where the stories take it. We are all aware of the relationship between the industrial schools, the mother and baby homes and the laundries which were all part of the institutional network. If that is where the story goes, it must be followed there.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> There is an outstanding issue in regard to An Grianan at High Park because for various reasons some women did not receive an award from the redress board and were also denied support under the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme because An Grianan had not been included, yet we know that some girls there worked in the laundry. This small group of women hoped their issues would be addressed in the mother and baby homes investigation. I discussed this issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the women concerned had that expectation. However, they will now have to take the judicial route.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> I am aware that one group of people included in the terms of reference for the commission was happy to meet the Minister who gave them time to discuss their issues. It includes mixed race Irish people. Their issue is colour-specific abuse which they suffered while in Irish institutional care. Some 71 people have been identified in this group to date, but they believe the group should number approximately from 100 to 150 born to African fathers and Irish mothers. Some women went to Britain to give birth, but they returned and placed their babies in the care of the State. Some went straight into mother and baby homes, while some were given up for fostering and adoption. Some of the mothers ended up in the laundries, while some raised the children themselves. These children have never received recognition for their cases to date. They were failed by the State and many of them suffered chronic racial abuse in institutions. They suffered appalling treatment and were left helpless and unprotected. Some 51% of the known 71 spent their entire childhoods in the institutions, while only 12% were adopted. These children had to endure the double impact of being illegitimate and of mixed race. I acknowledge the Minister's role in meeting this group and listening to them. They hope their issues will be addressed during the commission's investigation because they have waited so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> We acknowledge the work of Catherine Corless and also Dr. Devlin who took on the State and the Church. It is important to establish the facts. I acknowledge that is what the Minister is trying to do. However, the commission must go further and complete the narrative. I hope the provision concerning specific matters not included in the scope of the investigation which may warrant further investigation will allow the investigation to continue. I wish the commission well in its investigation.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_547">I welcome the publication on 9 January of the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes and certain related matters, which will be constituted under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. It is important to note that is a commission of inquiry rather than a tribunal. There are concerns about tribunals costing a great deal of money and going on for years. It would be great if all institutions could be investigated but is this possible in the context of the time required and so on? It is proposed to examine 14 institutions and a representative sample of county homes to be selected by the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> The interdepartmental committee report to establish the facts around State involvement in the Magdalen laundries dealt with institutions in County Galway. I recall the poignant State apology in February 2013 to the victims and survivors of the laundries. The Ryan report on child abuse detailed the horrific conditions and abuse endured by boys in Letterfrack Industrial School. Last May, reports emerged about the Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, which attracted international coverage. As a nation, we have been coming to terms with our past over the last decade or more. The investigation into the manner in which single women and their children were treated in mother and baby homes, how they came to be there and the circumstances of their departures is the latest part of the process of coming to terms with the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I also acknowledge the fact that the fathers of these babies got away scot free. Today in modern Ireland we all understand that fathers have rights and responsibilities. Regrettably, in old Ireland, when a young girl fell pregnant and had a baby, the view at the time was that it was her fault, her sin and her shame. It was not and it should not have been. Two people were involved - a mother and a father.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> I welcome the consultation that has taken place since the Dáil decided last July to initiate this inquiry as well as last week's Cabinet decision. I also welcome the willingness of those who were centrally involved and who have contributed to the process this far. I welcome the appointments of Judge Yvonne Murphy as chairperson and of two experts, Dr. William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly. It is always important that inquiries such as this have appropriate powers and there will always be concern about this. The 2004 Act confers powers to seek and facilitate voluntary co-operation of people whose evidence it requires. The inquiry will have a wide range of coercive powers, if required. The members will be able to give direction to people to attend or to answer questions and they will have powers to disclose and produce documents, powers of entry and inspection, powers to seize documents and equipment and powers to make determinations and give direction where privilege is claimed over documents. If a person fails to comply, the commission can apply to the courts to compel compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The commission will be able to access all records relevant to its work, no matter the status of the person or entity in possession of the records, which is welcome. The evidence will generally be held in private except where a witness requests to give evidence in public. There may be cases where people want to tell their stories and outline what happened to them in public in order that the country can witness their testimony. That would have to be an individual choice. The commission would have to grant the request where the commission feels it desirable in the interests of both the investigation and fair procedures for the evidence to be in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> A number of groups have commented on the commission. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has welcomed the comprehensive terms of reference and emphasised the importance of independence, impartiality, transparency and expertise. It also stated it is vital that victims are consulted during the investigation and given a voice in the process. The organisation One Family, which was founded in 1972, also welcomed the publication of the terms of reference. Its directors felt that they and other groups were listened to during the consultation. They also feel that it is of great importance that there is an awareness of the social context that contributed to discrimination against non-marital families and mothers. The Adoption Rights Alliance cautiously welcomed elements of the terms of reference. However, it has concerns that the inquiry is limited to investigating institutions and agencies with direct connection to a mother and baby home and excludes women who gave birth in State and private maternity homes and who also may have suffered illegal adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I welcome the commission and hope it will hear all the evidence in an open fashion and report to the satisfaction of all who suffered.</p>

        <speech by="#JimDaly" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_554">Táim fíor bhuíoch as ucht an deis labhairt. This is a difficult topic for any of us to make a contribution because it is associated with painful, traumatic and heart-rending stories that we have heard through the modern day media doing their best to give us a feel for what it was like for the people caught up in this but, at the end of day, all most of us can do is try to imagine and understand. A commission that tries to get to the bottom of what went on and tries to make right some of the wrongs that were perpetrated will have an incredibly challenging time. From the bottom of my heart, I wish the commission the best of success and I wish the Minister and the Department in their guidance and stewardship of the commission heartfelt good wishes as well with what will be a difficult and traumatic story to be told by many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I have limited knowledge of what happened, although I have had the great good fortune, honour and privilege of working with children in the care of the State. That has given me some understanding of the difficulties faced by children who struggle with their identity and sense of belonging when they become adults and have questions about this. It is a difficult and challenging road for them to navigate. While what happened in the homes is examined, these questions need to be answered more than anything else to assist people to repair relationships and bring them together.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I remain haunted by a story I heard. A friend of my dad's was in our home and he talked about a neighbour of his when he was a young boy who walked around the yard repeatedly. This young woman had a heavy sack of potatoes on her back and she walked around in circles for days on end. The man recounted how as young men they wondered what this was about. It was only in later years that they learned that this poor, unfortunate young woman was pregnant and this was her attempt to rid herself of what she considered to be the cancer in her body. That is how society taught that young woman and her extended family to react to probably one the greatest and most exciting and brilliant times in people's lives when they discover they are pregnant and will create a life. This poor individual did not live in a society that was accepting of a young woman being pregnant outside of wedlock and fear was the dominant emotion that she and her extended family experienced at the time. The reason I recount this is she entered one of the homes subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> With regard to the issue of the mortality rate in the homes, I do not apportion blame but we need to review all the circumstances in the context of the time they occurred. Having tried to inflict maximum physical damage on her body to end the pregnancy, this poor individual entered a home and lost the baby. There were many compounding factors for the loss of the baby. Society should take the largest share of the blame but it is not for me to play judge and jury in hindsight. We need to look at the events of the past but we also need to be careful not to do so through the prism of today's attitudes because we need to be cognisant of the shameful attitudes in times past.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> The best gift we could give to the commission is all of us as a society acknowledging our shameful past and contribution to these individuals' lives and ensuring we do our bit today to challenge society on issues of inclusiveness and acceptance while questioning attitudes along the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">This is something for all of us to take into the future. From my heart, I wish this commission the very best. It is an extraordinary challenge and I know there are many aspects of it that people are not happy with - that it is not covering enough and is not reaching out to enough people. It is, however, a start that is welcome and I hope it will serve to ease the pain carried every day by mothers separated from their children. I hope the results of this commission will go some way towards addressing that. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ColmKeaveney" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_560">There is much political play made in this Chamber about the necessity for an apology to the survivors. On behalf of the people of Galway East, I would like to say "Sorry" to those survivors. I hope they hear it loud and clear from this Chamber. I also understand how difficult it is for the Government not to get to its feet today and say sorry. It is the advice it has been given. I hope that whatever little sense survivors can take from that acknowledgement goes some way to address their circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I broadly welcome the terms of reference for a commission but I share the concerns outlined by my colleagues in the Chamber today. I ask the Minister to consider taking on board the observations made by all Deputies in the Chamber over the course of this debate. The terms of reference demonstrate some flexibility. My concern is that in the past, previous inquiries and tribunals were challenged in the courts in respect of that same type of flexibility. It would be better if the Minister would consider opening up the terms of reference for amendment, as has been proposed by other Deputies in the House today. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> If that was the case, we could include three holding centres: Temple Hill, Stamullen and the nurseries in Fermoy; Westbank, Ovoca (or Avoca) House, Braemar House, St. Philomena's and St. Gerard's; and St. Rita's nursing home and the second Regina Coeli hostel, which was the sister of another hostel in Dublin which was included. If we amended the terms of reference, we could expand it make it more inclusive, get more information and seek as much justice as possible for those who have been injured by the past. The method of taking a representative sample of county homes is reasonable enough but survivor groups have requested through their Oireachtas representatives that the sample should include any home where a survivor from such a home presents themselves to the commission. It is unfair to exclude any survivor because we have segregated homes and said that one home will take precedent over another. It is unfair to those people who seek to have questions answered. It is not an unreasonable request and would provide at least a partial measure of justice to survivors whose circumstances are not provided for in the appendices. Given the large body of records and research that has already been gathered on the Magdalen laundries, it is inexplicable as to why we would turn our faces from these people. Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to consider including those data.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> The treatment of women and children in these institutions and in society at large is a dark chapter in our history. We need to face up to it, be honest and complete this process in the interest of justice for everybody involved. We also need to pay tribute to those people by having an open, transparent and inclusive process. Given the mortality rates, forced adoptions, forced labour and the mechanisms of shame imposed on those people, they require the most inclusive process to ensure that this commission is worthy of the justice that is required. Society's shaming placed women and children into these homes. It ensured that the dark events of our past - the unsayable - were kept unknown. These mother and baby homes must be seen in the broader context of the scale of institutions that existed in this country in the past, be they mother and baby homes, industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and mental health facilities. It has been said in this House that at one point in our history, we had more people locked up as a proportion of our population than the Soviet Union. We know that society, State and the churches combined to shame these women and their children, sought to separate these vulnerable people from the rest of so-called respectable society and punish them for actions that were not a crime under any statute law. Rather, they were being punished for violating a harsh and unforgiving social code.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> It is important that we face up to our past and state in unambiguous terms that the survivors of these homes have no cause for shame. I invite the rest of society to open its arms to ensure they can be part of the acknowledgement of the dedication, commitment and action for justice for those survivors. We know that church and State combined together and engaged in forced adoptions, aspects of whom continue to echo in respect of the refusal of certain bodies to permit those affected to have access to their own information. The long history of forced adoption in this country needs to be faced up to and we need to amend the law where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Worse still, those not adopted were often sent out as virtual slave labour on farms or in businesses owned by the so-called respectable persons in society. I have personally met former residents of the homes and I ask that the Minister include those people and allow them to make their allegations about the practice of child labour and the abuse that took place in rural Ireland in respect of farming out children as slave labour for the well-off. I have also met others who were farmed out to the infamous industrial schools and endured physical, mental and sexual torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> We also know that vaccines and clinical drug trials were carried out on children in the care of the State in homes subcontracted to and run by the churches. This information is not new and has been known for well over a decade. In respect the extent of the practice and questions around it, we cannot be complacent about securing truth and justice. </p>
          <p eId="para_567"> This story began in Tuam and the many of the specifics of what happened there seem likely to have been common in other mother and baby homes. In Tuam, we know that almost 800 children died in the mother and child home enduring a mortality rate that was far higher that the prevailing national infant mortality rate at the time. We know that their deaths were recorded but not the circumstances of their burial. We know that some if not all of the bodies were buried in unmarked graves in or near the site of the home. We know that there are some skeletal remains within a tank, most likely a disused septic tank, which lies inside a local authority housing estate on the Dublin Road in Tuam. In its high mortality rates and in its burial practices, Tuam was not unusual in comparison to other such homes. I hope the commission will examine the circumstance of the burial of deceased children. There is a need, unfulfilled since this story broke, for the State to take an active part with regard to managing that grave site. This matter is causing considerable distress to many families in that area who suspect that their relatives are buried there and to those living in the estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I have been contacted by some of them who have been distressed by the accumulating speculation and rumour about burial sites in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">We need to get into that location to clarify the nature of the burial site and the tank. Even if only one body is discovered, that will still leave us with almost 800 dead children unaccounted for. Even if we find all 796 children buried in neat rows and with obvious care, it will still leave us with a mortality rate far in excess of the national figure. The site in Tuam should be properly secured, as should any records connected to the Tuam home and to all other such homes throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The fact of malnourishment being listed as a cause of death is worrying and requires investigation, as does the exact function and management of the dying room. Who was monitoring these homes, from the point of view of the State and the church? This State outsourced and privatised the care of the most vulnerable of people. Who in this House was responsible for ensuring accountability and transparency on behalf of the most vulnerable people in our history?</p>

          <p eId="para_571">The announcement two weeks ago of a commission to investigate mother and baby homes is another step we have to take to deal with the failures of the past. These reports help us to heal past wounds while giving us opportunities to learn from our mistakes. I think the Minister has found the right chair in Judge Yvonne Murphy, who has proven in the past that she is capable of handling complex and serious issues with sensitivity. She will need this sensitivity as she deals with people who were hurt, abused and traumatised by their experiences in these homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> However, we must consider not only individuals' experiences in these homes but also, as the report puts it, the exit pathways that led children out of them. Unfortunately, many exit pathways led to more abuse and neglect, with long lasting effects on those affected. It is important that what happened to the children after their time in the homes are investigated and documented and that people who broke the law are brought to justice. I know from speaking with survivors that they deserve no less than the justice they have been waiting for.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I have been fortunate in the past couple of years to work with a group called Mixed Race Irish. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan eloquently outlined the experiences of members of this group in her contribution. The group comprises people who were born to mixed race parents in the Ireland of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and whose births were handled in the only way that official Ireland knew at the time. The babies were taken from their mothers and fathers and put into mother and baby homes, where they experienced harrowing and painful treatment. Many of those concerned have carried their experiences throughout their adult lives. When representatives of the group appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality last year, they stated that the State singularly and spectacularly failed mixed race children. I have been working with the founders of the group, Carole and Evon Brennan, Rosemary Adaser and Conrad Bryan, to rectify this failing and to find ways for the State to acknowledge its failure. I am aware that the Minister has met these individuals and that he recognises the truth of their story. The group has grown from strength to strength since 2012 and now has over 70 members, many of whom live in the UK. Very few of them stayed in Ireland after reaching the age of majority because they were told bluntly by the managers of these homes that they had no future in this country. They were told that if they stayed here they would find it difficult to get work or meet a partner in life. Many of them had no choice but to emigrate to other countries. They survived and in many cases are dealing well with their experiences growing up in Ireland. In addition to appearing before the joint committee, the group also met a number of Members of these Houses, including several Ministers, and its representatives have conducted local and national media interviews about their collective histories and to reach out to other members of this community who may not be aware of the group's existence. They have shown incredible bravery, fortitude and resilience. I am extremely proud to have worked so closely with them. Their hard work has started to pay off because race is mentioned specifically in the terms of reference for the commission of investigation. I do not believe this would have happened without the hard work done by the Mixed Race Irish group. The terms of reference ask the commission:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_574">To identify...the extent to which any group of residents may have systematically been treated differently on any grounds [religion, race, traveller identity or disability]. </p>
          <p eId="para_575">This explicit reference to race is a vindication of the group and a recognition of the experiences of mixed race children. This good work needs to continue. I urge the Minister to ensure the commission also includes a separate section on race in its report. We do not want all the grounds mentioned in the terms of reference to be dealt with in one section. It is important that the specific stories of each of the relevant groups are investigated and recognised by the commission. We cannot allow the commission to undo the good work that has just been started by failing to recognise that issue from the outset. I ask the Minister to ensure that the commission meets with members of the Mixed Race Irish group to speak with them about their experiences and to assure them race will be dealt with separately in the report. Such an assurance would go a long way to vindicating their rights and, in the process, helping them to heal. We have an opportunity not only to deal with the unspoken racism of the past but also to shine a light on the racism of today. We have to learn from the past if we are to combat the scourge of racism. The commission affords us such an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I commend the Minister on the work he has done to date to prepare inclusive terms of reference. It is a good start to this process and I wish the commission well in its work.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate and I acknowledge the men and women in the Public Gallery who have come to the House to follow this debate. In June 2014, Amnesty International's Europe and central Asia director, John Dalhuisen, stated that Ireland's obligation to provide truth, justice and reparations to victims of past human rights abuses must be central to the work of the commission of investigation, and that is essential to confront and deal with this legacy if Ireland is to progress as a society that respects rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">It was noted that the Government must respond to the commission's findings with a more faithful adherence to its obligations under international human rights law than in the case of the Magdalen laundries. Victims should be able to participate effectively in the commission's investigations and be consulted on key issues where their interests are affected. They should be treated with humanity and respect for their dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> The terms of reference for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and related matters propose to establish a series of basic truths regarding the circumstances of entry of single women into named institutions between 1922 and 1998. Their living conditions, mortality rates and exit pathways are to be investigated. The commission will seek to do the same for the children of these women and establish how they were cared for within those institutions and what adoptive procedures were in place. The commission will ask whether mothers' consents were given fully, freely and with full information. For survivors of those institutions and their families to have confidence in the findings of the commission, it must identify any violations of the rights of these citizens, identify those responsible and propose effective remedies. Only then will justice be seen to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The establishment of the commission of investigation is to be welcomed. Sinn Féin argues that the commission must be cross-Border in nature and that any international dimensions should be accounted for also. This would require cross-jurisdictional and international co-operation. The time span as outlined is too limited. It covers the period between 1922 and 1998, which presumes that with the closure of mother and baby homes all related concerns disappeared. This could not be farther from the truth. Massive legacy issues remain, including the inaccurate recording of children's and mothers' deaths, causes of deaths and unidentified burial grounds. Another significant and alarming legacy issue is the matter of trial vaccinations on vulnerable children within care. In my constituency of east Cork, I have met with several individuals who were subjected to vaccine trials while in mother and baby homes. The main concern for these individuals is the lack of information around the drugs prescribed. In some cases there have been residual effects. Understandably, this causes huge ongoing distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, has told us that the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes will have the power to compel the drug companies which conducted vaccine trials on children resident in the homes to come before it. This is to be welcomed. The commission will examine whether regulatory and ethical standards were followed in relation to vaccine trials conducted on children. At least ten mother and baby homes were involved and it is believed the trials took place between 1960 and 1976. Fresh reports suggest that at least 3,000 children in 24 residential institutions and as many as 40,000 children among the general child population were administered experimental vaccines. As an investigation into vaccine trials was previously stopped following a Supreme Court ruling, it is very important that those vulnerable children who were subjected to testing without consent are given justice. Many of these children did not realise that they had even been involved in the trials until 30 years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The vaccine trials were conducted by Burroughs Wellcome, which is now GlaxoSmithKline. Children were subjected to trials of the four-in-one vaccine. No detailed records of the trials were recorded, nor was there any detail on whether informed consent was given. We must find out exactly what happened, who sanctioned these decisions and why these children were held in such low regard by those who should have protected them. Redress is warranted. In this context, victims of the mother and baby homes need a positive right to representation before the commission and legal costs should not be a barrier to this. They should also be supported by an independent advocacy service, which we suggest could be managed through the network of free legal advice centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The institutional scope as outlined in the Government's order is far too narrow. The terms of reference should encompass all mother and baby homes regardless of denomination, both Catholic and Protestant. Mother and baby homes and related institutions were merely one part of a network of institutions and individuals which illegally abridged Irish mothers' human rights. However, the terms of reference frame the inquiry as an investigation of a too narrow sample of named institutions and not as an investigation of extensive practices spanning the full spectrum of related institutional types. Survivors have expressed the concern that the commission will not be allowed to examine lives blighted outside institutions where unmarried mothers were forced to give up their children. Survivors have also said that while the terms of reference mention exit pathways from mother and baby homes, it is unclear if such pathways led into similarly dysfunctional institutions to which children were sent. Children who arrived in mother and baby homes from other pathways have been excluded from the terms of reference. Children sometimes arrived direct from maternity hospitals. It is also recommended that the commission should have specific regard to the agencies, hospitals and other institutions, and related professionals alleged to have been involved in facilitating illegal or forced adoptions and, or, illegal birth registrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> The Magdalen laundries constituted a significant exit pathway as part of the containment of supposed problem women and girls. As the McAleese report was limited to the question of State involvement in the Magdalen laundries, the commission should have specific regard to the women who resided in these institutions and extend the scope and intensity of the investigation to include them in its inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Given the age profile of the survivors, a timely full public State apology is of the utmost importance. This need not wait for the outcome of the commission's final report in three years' time. All survivors deserve public acknowledgement and tribute. There should also be provision for official mourning and commemoration of those who died in these institutions. This should include the right to a name and dignified burial for those who are buried in mass graves. Survivors' families and next of kin should be fully included in the process of planning in this regard. This is stated in the Sinn Féin submission on the proposed commission of investigation. While the inclusion of Bessboro House of Blackrock, Cork, in the list of institutions in the investigations is welcome, I urge strongly the inclusion of Braemar House and the Nursery Rescue Society, Fermoy. We call for all victims from other related institutions also to be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Effective remedies and redress must include financial compensation and other social supports. They must also include the right to information and contact, on foot of legislative change if necessary, to facilitate access to personal and family records and adoption information and tracing. The Minister has indicated that this is beyond the scope of the commission but we need - and the survivors deserve - the assurance that it will be properly dealt with in tandem. The State must ensure that the orders and other institutions are held fully accountable and make a full proportionate contribution towards remedy and reparation commensurate with their level of responsibility as found by the commission. That should include contributions to the cost of the investigation. There must be no indemnity deal with the religious orders as happened in previous times.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">I welcome the Minister. I welcome the initiative he has introduced and am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion on the draft order for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes. The terms of reference are not perfect by any means. In fact, they make it quite clear that this is not the final word on the issue of the treatment of mothers and babies in this country over very many decades during the 20th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is another important step in Ireland's coming to terms with its tragic past.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The industrial schools and reformatories condemned generations of Ireland's poor and marginalised children to separation from their parents and families and to lives of misery and drudgery in grim, isolated institutions. Although these institutions were condemned in 1970 by Miss Justice Eileen Kennedy, they were only gradually phased out. The apology of the Taoiseach in 1998 and the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board in 2002 under the Residential Institutions Redress Act enabled tens of thousands of the institutionalised youth of Ireland of the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to receive some acknowledgement of their treatment and the survivors some recompense for their suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The 2009 Ryan report on child abuse produced a devastating examination and analysis of the operation of these institutions and the mistreatment of the children. Subsequently, in 2011, the present Government moved the process further and set up the investigation into the Magdalen homes, where thousands of young Irish women were incarcerated without trial, largely for the crime of becoming pregnant and bearing children out of wedlock. Former Senator Martin McAleese produced his report in 2013, and a scheme of redress was put in place. While none of these initiatives was perfect, they all contributed to addressing, however inadequately, the wrongs that were perpetrated on the children and mothers of Ireland under an uncaring, unchristian society in much of the 20th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Today, the latest phase of the Government's attempts to undo the wrongs of previous generations is initiated. It, too, is far from perfect and will not address all the concerns of those survivors who were placed in mother and baby homes. Most serious of all is the fact that so many are no longer with us and have never seen any State acknowledgement of their suffering as young citizens of this country. Given that many of the survivors, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery today, and whom I welcome, are now in their twilight years, it is important that we get it as right as possible on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I congratulate the Coalition of Mother and Baby Home Survivors, both in Ireland and abroad, on the campaigning work they have done to date. I am pleased that Bethany Home, a Protestant mother and baby institution, has at last been included in this inquiry. In 2002, when the Residential Institutions Redress Bill was being debated, I met the courageous and determined Derek Leinster and extracted a commitment from the then Minister for Education, Michael Woods, that Bethany Home would be included in an additional schedule of institutions under the legislation. This was 12 years ago. It never happened, and successive Ministers all refused, despite the protestations of Mr. Leinster and his colleagues. Now, at last, after 12 years of constant campaigning, they have got a commission of inquiry. They should be facilitated in telling their stories, both as a testament to their experience and as a record of that unsavoury past, lest we ever forget. There is ample provision within the terms of reference to facilitate full personal testimony.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> The second mother and baby case with which I have been engaged over many years is the case of baby Marion Howe, who died in 1955 in controversial circumstances, having been transferred from Goldenbridge orphanage in Inchicore, which was run by the Sisters of Mercy. Marion was aged 11 months when she was admitted into Goldenbridge. Marion's mother was ill at the time and her father was working in England. She was to be in Goldenbridge for only two weeks while her mother recovered. On 21 May 1955, just four days after her admittance, Marion died. Although the Sisters of Mercy sent a telegram to her father telling him not to come home, and he had little money as he was working as a labourer in England, he decided to come home. When he went to see Marion at the mortuary in St. Ultan's Hospital, he saw that her head and two legs were bandaged. When unwrapping the bandages, he saw two identical holes on the insides of her knees. However, the cause of death on the death certificate was given as acute dysentery infection. Marion's parents went to the Garda at the time, but were told to let it go. The family went to the Garda again 40 years later, in 1996, when such matters came into the public domain. At first, the Sisters of Mercy denied that Marion had ever been in Goldenbridge. However, gardaí eventually uncovered a sick book that named Marion and which read, "one leg burned and a history of vomiting". That is where the case rests.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The accusations in the 1996 RTE documentaries "Dear Daughter" and "States of Fear", which focused on mismanagement and mistreatment in Goldenbridge have never been followed up or fully explained. The findings of the Ryan Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in 2009 were scathing of Goldenbridge as a place where children were humiliated, assaulted and neglected. Goldenbridge should be included in the schedule of mother and baby homes, and the remains of Marion Howe should be exhumed as part of that investigation. This will be the last opportunity for some considerable time to address the issues involved and this commission is the ideal forum for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> I thank the Minister for setting up this inquiry within a relatively short six months of coming to office. I also thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for recently agreeing to ask the Dublin City Coroner to review the case for exhumation of the remains of baby Marion. It is the dearest wish of the family members, some of whom are here today, that the exhumation should take place so that, at last, the cause of death can be determined after 60 years without answers. Their mother and father, who fought for many years so that the circumstances of baby Marion's death would be examined, are sadly deceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I welcome the provisions in the terms of reference that provide flexibility for the commission to decide how it proceeds with its investigation. I further welcome the Minister's invitation to the family in a reply to a parliamentary question on 14 January 2015, in which he stated that "the family may wish to consider providing the commission with any information in their possession which they consider may be relevant to its terms of reference". The terms of reference state: "the commission may include in its reports any recommendation that it considers appropriate, including recommendations in relation to relevant matters identified in the course of its investigation which it considers may warrant further investigation in the public interest". This case falls within the commission's remit and Goldenbridge should be included in the schedule of homes to be inquired into.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> There are other similar cases throughout the country of families being bereft of their children. Many stories have been only partially told and people have lived for up to 60 years with a legacy of what they believe to have been mistreatment, humiliation and serious neglect of members of their families. They want an end to it. They want to be able to put these matters to bed. As I said, we have taken it step by step. Ireland has been very slow to address the grievances that have been in the public domain and to recognise the flawed society we have had for so many decades. I ask that we re-examine some of the institutions that have and have not been included in the schedule. As we discuss the draft terms of reference of the commission we must ensure it is as comprehensive as possible so that we do not have another generation coming back to this and asking why we did not finish the business while there were still some survivors left.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Let us ensure this is our legacy.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">I welcome to the Gallery any of the families or relatives of survivors of any of these homes. I must start on a negative note. It is a bad sign that the Government saw fit to cut the debate today by an hour and a half. It is not showing sufficient seriousness and I must state the Government benches are not showing sufficient seriousness regarding this matter either. This is part of a legacy of abuse and oppression of women and children in this State. It runs through the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and other institutions mentioned previously such as Goldenbridge. It runs through the practice, for example, of symphysiotomy when women were butchered while giving birth and the recent practice - not in the dim and distant past - of this State going to court against women who have been abused either at school or in some institution and challenging their cases. This has been evident right up to the present. Moreover, to this one must also add laws, such as the eighth amendment, which equate women with a foetus and do not give women control over their own lives. The common denominator of all these practices is that the State and the church saw fit to take control of the lives and bodies of women and girls. Members must recognise this pattern, which has continued right up to the present and which has not gone away, of a church-ridden and weak capitalist State that allowed the church such absolutely massive power.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> As both I and interested groups perceive it, there are major shortcomings in the scheme, which only includes mother and baby homes strictly. The Adoption Rights Alliance, for example, has called on the Government to amend the first clause of the terms of reference to include all institutions where women had babies and where women out of wedlock went to do that. I believe this constitutes piece-by-piece resistance to tackling this real issue. While it has been hinted at previously, the failure to include archaeological investigation of all the sites is of real importance. This has been brought to light already in the past year by Catherine Corless, who rightly has been commended. In many cases, it is known that these institutions were the scenes of crimes. If it is known that crimes were carried out - premature deaths of babies took place at a much higher rate than the national average - consequently these people deserve investigation as to what happened to those babies. Furthermore, one cannot rely on records in the institutions to tell the story of what happened to the babies because that would be taking the word of the religious orders as being absolutely valid and trustworthy. However, Members are aware this is not the case. Many records have been destroyed and what is needed is a forensic medical examination of what in many cases are mass graves. This was evident in Tuam but there are other institutions as well. I suspect the main reason such investigations are not included is because of the cost. It would cost the State a huge amount of money to do that but this is an absolutely cancerous episode in our history, albeit one of many, and it must be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Irish First Mothers, which is a group of women who were victims of the mother and baby homes, also has pointed out that justice and redress are not mentioned directly in the terms of reference. Will any perpetrator be prosecuted after this commission investigates? Will any of the religious orders with connections to these homes be brought to answer in any way? Will there be proper medical and financial compensation for the victims of these homes? It is hard to escape the conclusion arrived at by this group, which is that what is envisaged is minimalist redress, symphysiotomy style, that will be on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. Women will be obliged to agree if they want any kind of compensation for the misery caused to them on behalf of these institutions and the State, which in many cases paid for or knew of their care. How hopeful can Members be when the Magdalen survivors have not been dealt with properly, as one has read in the newspapers only within the past two days? One Magdalen survivor, who I have met at a number of meetings, is dying of lung cancer. Survivors have asked that the coalition would deliver on the high profile promises that were made. The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, got very emotional in the Dáil Chamber but it has come to light lately that they still have not got what they need. How seriously are Members to take the Government's efforts to deal with the mother and baby homes? For example, the National Women's Council of Ireland has pointed out that the current Bill relating to the Magdalen women is a "denial of the rights of women survivors of the...laundries". It undermines the scheme as proposed by Mr. Justice Quirke and provides only minimal recognition for the abuse that woman suffered. If this is the pattern for the Magdalen women, can the women of the mother and baby homes and their surviving descendants expect any better from the Government? I conclude by reiterating that I view this as part of a pattern in which the State and the church colluded in the oppression of women and children and girls in particular, denying them control of their own sexuality and future. The State needs to listen to these groups and to respond accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">First, the State has many questions to answer in this regard. What has gone on down through the years is horrendous and I welcome the survivors who are present in the Gallery today. In the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes, people suffered. This was in an Ireland where one could nearly say a blanket was put over matters, there was quietness and nobody talked about the wrongs that were done down through the years. One must also remember the question of where these children were buried. The Tuam Children's Home Graveyard Committee has brought to my attention one such case. There is a graveyard there in which approximately 800 babies have been buried. People in the Tuam area, not now or ten, 20 or 30 years ago but 40 to 50 years ago, voluntarily kept the grounds there. Year by year, they looked after the site and put up gates and statues. They did so in a voluntary way when the State had walked away from it. Through their anger and throughout all this, they kept their silence and before the terms of reference were approved, they kept quiet. Sadly, they have not been included in this scheme. While a local stonemason, Liam Kelly, donated a plaque to those children, one thing they found in that area was that even after the searching, some inaccuracies remained. They want the State to ensure that all those children are cross-referenced to ensure the information is factual, proper and right because the information regarding one baby that was named was wrong. The committee in Tuam also has made a request of the Minister through me. Its members have stated they consider themselves to have been left out of this process. They wish to meet the Minister personally to talk to him, to feel included in this regard and to express all the issues and problems involved in the Tuam case. At present, they feel left out and believe the Minister should look again at this and should make sure they are included. I hope the Minister will listen to all these people throughout Ireland in respect of what has gone on. Let us right what has gone wrong. I refer to redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Whatever is needed, let us as a nation recognise our failures, learn from what we have done wrong and show remorse for the scandalous things that happened years ago. I will be writing to the Minister in the coming days asking that he take the time to meet with the committee from Tuam and allow their voices to be heard.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">The purpose of this amendment is to pierce the corporate veil. There is a major difficulty in society whereby companies are created to defend moneys or individuals in their responsibilities to employees. For example, I know of local authorities that have tendering processes for waste disposal services whereby one company applies for the contract, that is, the company with the assets, while another company employs the individuals. Thereafter, company B, the company that employs the individuals, goes to the Labour Relations Commission to seek a reduction in wages, claiming its financial health is not good enough to pay the employees the wage rates at which they were employed, yet the company in good financial health is the one that holds the tender. The amendment is an effort to pierce the corporate veil, the paper wall behind which individuals and corporations can hide from their responsibilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">Amendment No. 14 is not appropriate as section 7(2) provides for the criminal liability of certain persons connected with a body corporate in certain circumstances in the case of offences under the Bill. Extending liability for the debts of a solvent company through the officers of a company would, I am advised by the Attorney General, be constitutionally suspect and represent a major departure in company law. The overriding principle of company law is that a director’s duties are owed to the company, not to individual shareholders or employees. If there is a breach of duty on their part which causes damage to the company, they can be sued and held liable for damages. Claims can be brought by shareholders or financial institutions or on a director versus director basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Liability may arise from lack of care and skill in the performance of a director’s duties, negligent advice or misstatement, any act which goes beyond the limits of the company’s constitution such as extensive borrowing, unauthorised payments, a failure to disclose the full extent of the director’s interests or a failure to comply with requirements that may involve a director or an officer in a personal liability. Company law penalties vary from restriction or disqualification orders to fines and periods of imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> The Companies Bill 2012 provides for a four-tier categorisation of most offences, with the exception of fraudulent trading and market abuse. The Bill also contains a new provision in section 872 whereby, following conviction for an offence under the companies Act, the trial judge may order that the convicted person should remedy any breach of the companies Act with which he or she was connected.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In effect, the provision of the Companies Bill is more constitutionally robust rewording of section 3(8)(iii) of the 1963 Act, as amended in 2001. From a company law perspective, the proposed amendment challenges the entire principle of company law. If it were to be implemented, the doctrine of separate legal personality would become an exception rather than the rule. Having regard to the foregoing, I am not going to accept this amendment. In the Seanad I will be introducing an amendment to make it an offence to refuse to pay unless the respondent can show he or she is not in a position to pay. Prosecution is also possible under section 7 for conniving. This series of powers and offences goes some of the way, if not all of the way, to meeting the Deputy's concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">Section 32 as drafted is strictly limited in its application to information relating to the alleged commission of an offence under a relevant enactment, or the contravention of a relevant enactment. For this reason, the Deputy's proposed amendment to subsection 3 is inappropriate, as it is inconsistent with the section taken as a whole. The Deputy is seeking to amend section 32, the disclosure of information relating to offences to other bodies. He is seeking to go beyond using the information for an offence, which is a legitimate grounds for sharing information, to have a very wide dispersion of information for any purpose. That goes beyond the provisions of privacy within which the information is provided to various bodies. This is going well beyond what is envisaged by this section and it is not something I could support. We are ensuring that information that could assist in the prosecution of an offence is shared. That is the purpose of the section.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">As the Minister should be aware at this stage, many aspects of the construction industry in this State are broken. There is wholescale migration from direct employment towards relevant contracts tax, RCTs, in an effort by construction companies to gain a competitive advantage with regard to the lack of a minimum wage and pay and conditions that often go with RCTs. This amendment would go some way towards dealing with these issues. I have raised the Kishoge issue with the Minister a number of times. Subcontracting chains are part of the reality of the delivery of contracts in this State and we are in effect extending the liability beyond the principal contractor, with whom the public contracting authority has entered into the contract, with regard to subcontracts. In addition, the contracting authority should be empowered to exclude from the tendering process employers who are seriously or repeatedly in breach of employment rights. This amendment is in line with provisions within the new public procurement directives on the award of concession contracts. These directives provide for joint and several liability. This is an effort to bring this legislation into line with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">I agree with Deputy Tóibín. I spent my life in the construction industry and sadly the behaviour of many companies leaves much to be desired. There are some powerful companies that never put a foot wrong; they play by the rules and do things well. It is unfair to these companies that others can flout the rules on a regular basis and still manage to get very big contracts, including from the State. I have not examined how Deputy Tóibín has framed it, but I support tighter regulation around anyone who has the audacity to flout the system in this way or in any way related to employment. The idea that they could tender for another State job and be able to get it is unfair to all the contractors that play by the rules.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">Deputy Tóibín's amendment seeks to ensure that where the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, identifies non-compliance with employment legislation, that information would be brought to the attention of the contracting body, which would be a public body, like a council, in respect of the main contractor. He proposes that this would be extended also to subcontractors, in respect of which NERA found some non-compliance. There is some merit in what Deputy Tóibín is putting forward and although I am not disposed to accept this specific amendment, because the drafting is not quite right, I will go back to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, and seek to introduce an amendment in the Seanad that meets this valid concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">I thank the Minister for proposing to do that on in the Seanad. The logic is very clear. The rights of a worker on a site who is employed by a subcontractor rather than the principal contractor should not be any different from someone employed by a principal contractor. If we do not do that, we are saying that employing a subcontractor, and thereby diffusing responsibility, gives the principal contractor a competitive advantage. I withdraw the amendment in light of that information.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_631">In page 33, line 11, to delete “€2,000” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_632">“€4,000, save and except in the case of failing to pay the National Minimum Wage under section 23 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 a sum not exceeding €20,000 per employee”.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The maximum penalty should be at least €4,000. Revenue applies a figure of €4,000 in similar situations. This should help to deal with vexatious employers who seek to delay compliance. In Britain we have seen new legislation similar to this, which allows for a fine of £20,000 to deal with non-payment of the national minimum wage. We acknowledge the constitutional argument, but the bottom line is that lack of compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act undermines good business.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Low pay results in poverty and a transfer of wealth to those who have from those who have not. The proposed maximum fine of €2,000 is not an adequate deterrent and if we do not have an adequate deterrent then behaviour will not change. In many cases it will be worth the employer's while and he will save money by not complying and, even if he gets a fine, he is still quids-in. If the Government intends to stick to the constitutional argument for maintaining a low penalty payment, the Minister should consider increasing the fines administered by the courts instead.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">My comments are on the same theme. The idea of imposing a fine on an employer of €2,000 for paying below the minimum wage is almost an enticement for him to try it. He need only get away with it for ten weeks and then it is already paid off and every week that he gets away with it after that is a bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I assure the Minister that having worked not only in the construction industry but the restaurant industry as well I know that there are employers who pay below the minimum wage and it is rather difficult to compete with them. Certainly, the State is keen to create a fair playing field but if the Government wants to do that it should make it unattractive for people to cheat.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> In recent months workers have come to me and told me they have been getting paid less than the minimum wage to put in water meters. These were subcontractors. We have a major problem in this area. The general contractor employs the subcontractor and only deals directly with the subcontractor. We have a weakness in this area because we do not oblige the contractor to oversee what the subcontractor does. This should be examined, especially in cases of work given out by the State. A subcontractor who misbehaves should not get work from a contractor who is getting work from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Likewise, we have taken on people in the wine bars. I assure the Minister that some of those who have come to us were not getting the proper rate. Naturally, they were paying no tax. They were simply getting paid €5 or €6 into their hands. We asked them for their P60 forms but they did not have them. I asked how long they had been working in the country and where they had worked last. They said they had worked in such and such a place but had not been registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> We are trying to sell at a competitive rate against such businesses and sometimes we are close to them. We are dealing with the same customers. I assure the Minister that we do not act in this way, but we are being asked to compete with them and that is not fair. There should be far tighter regulation to ensure that this does not happen, regardless of the sector. I know that this is happening. We are not looking for a nanny State and I realise it is not easy for the State to have its finger in all these areas, but we have the potential to tighten things up a little. We could impose a far larger fine. That is only one aspect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Some employers pay less than the minimum wage. That is different from employing people who are not registered at all. In that area alone a fine of €2,000 is not going to stop them. They only have to get away with it for ten weeks and then everything is a bonus after that. If they are caught, they may decide to pay the €2,000 fine but they will have made money on it and they will have got away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> It would be better if the State took a far stronger position. The British have introduced a £20,000 fine for the same thing. Let us consider all the legislation introduced in the past 15 years in Ireland. We are inclined to do what the British do in many cases. We should do what they have done in this case as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_642">The debate may be going off on the wrong tack somewhat. The fixed payment notice is not for non-payment of the minimum wage. The case of an employer who is found not to have paid the minimum wage will be prosecuted as a criminal offence and the worker will have rights in respect of the wages he was due.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> The fixed payment notices are for more minor offences and they are to be issued by the inspector. They are instruments under several provisions, in particular, section 11 of the Protection of Employment Act, which provides a requirement on an employer to consult with employees and the Minister in respect of collective redundancies. They may also be issued under the Payment of Wages Act, which requires the provision of a payslip. This Act refers to the employer's obligation to provide an employee with a written statement of his average hourly rate of pay. These more minor offences are dealt with by a fixed payment notice under a summary procedure that is carried out by the inspector. The inspector can issue the notice. Then, when it is paid the requirement is met.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The cases that the Deputies have described, in which employers have systematically failed to pay the minimum wage, are offences and would be prosecuted. However, I do not believe it would be appropriate to have an inspector effectively making an adjudication and imposing a €20,000 fine for these offences. Under our system, the jurisdiction to make such decisions lies with the administration of justice, as set out in the Constitution. Those functions are the reserve of the courts. That is the backdrop to the issue. The €2,000 fine is for more minor offences, somewhat like issuing a traffic ticket. That is the category we are dealing with. The type of cases the Deputies have described would be pursued as criminal offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">Some of them have been. I have probably misinterpreted the Minister somewhat. The Minister has said that this covers the non-production of a payslip. That would not catch the employer who has not registered an individual. There is not a vast amount of that in the construction industry but there is a fair amount in the restaurant sector. In that sector many people are not registered and get paid below the minimum wage. The amendment would catch them.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> There is a perfectly good reason for not producing a payslip. Years ago there was some excuse for people starting off. Some people started companies but did not know how to do things properly and they were disorganised. However, those days are behind us and the excuse of disorganisation is long gone. If an employer does not give an employee a payslip today, there is a good reason for it. More than likely, the employer is breaking the rules in some way. That is not rocket science. This measure could catch the employer who is not paying his staff properly or providing payslips. If he is not doing things properly and he gives his staff payslips then he will be exposed. If an employer is paying less than the minimum wage he could not possibly produce a payslip. In that case, the employee would have paperwork that could damage the employer and, therefore, the employer would have no wish to give an employee concrete evidence on paper. This is why he would not give the employee a payslip and would decide to pay in cash instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> The restaurant industry would be stronger if everyone had to issue payslips and no one could pay people under the table. We would all be playing on a more level playing field. The State would be better off as well because it would take in more funds. I remain convinced that a fine of €2,000 to cover the non-issuing of payslips is insufficient. The penalty should be more severe.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">The Minister is saying it is unfair to assume someone who has not produced a payslip is automatically cheating rather than being negligent in his or her affairs. How does the Minister propose to deal with the guy who deliberately did not produce a payslip because he was paying staff under the table and not paying them the full rate? Is there anything in the Bill to deal with him in an active way?</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I know that I am not entitled to speak again, but one prosecutes such persons under the national minimum wage legislation. The legislation is in place to allow prosecution for non-payment. This simply is a fixed-notice penalty for a particular minor infringement. Clearly, if NERA detects that it does not just involve a minor infringement, that it is the tip of a much greater iceberg, it will investigate and prosecute.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">My argument is that legislation enabling such prosecutions is in place and that NERA has the ability to prosecute, but it is not working and the Minister must take my word for it. I have seen too many guys who came from other restaurants and who were not registered and employers are getting away with it. There is a problem with the system. Will the Bill address that problem in any way?</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The Minister said that perhaps the guy might have made a simple mistake. If the Minister was to introduce a fixed penalty of €5,000, for example, and also included an appeals system, the guy who was genuinely paying the proper wage and could prove it would be able to appeal against the imposition of the fine and would not be done unfairly. There is something wrong if the rules do not ensure things work properly. They are not. There are lots of people working in the black economy. It would be foolish to deny that we have a problem. If this Bill can help and an appeals system can be built into the process, that will be positive move on the part of the State.</p>

That is what this amendment seeks to resolve.</p>

Because they both must consent, the Deputy's amendment is superfluous and I am not disposed to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">It has been brought to our attention on a number of occasions that many cases do not get started on the first day. One of the reasons for this is that the relevant documentation is not available. This measure would obviously make that documentation available and would provide for discovery. It would also reduce the cost to the State with regard to lost time and unnecessary delays in case progression. It is a simple amendment that seeks to solve that problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">The purpose of mediation is to try to find a resolution without having to go to adjudication. It is set up in a way that the confidentiality of both parties is protected and whatever is said at mediation cannot be used at an adjudication. It is a protected arena in which people come together and try to find a solution without, if one likes, the fear that any documentation they produce can then be subsequently used in adjudication. That is what it is. It is to try to find a solution without going down the other route, and it is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> I think what the Deputies are trying to do is to provide that an officer would direct either party in a dispute which is the subject of mediation to produce documentation and evidence to the other party, which the party intends to rely upon in regard to the respective cases. It is actually defeating the mode of operation of the mediation approach and that is why I am not disposed to accept it. If it does go to adjudication, the power of subpoena for such documentation is open at that stage to the adjudication process. These are two different processes. I think what the Deputies are trying to do is put something from one into the other, which would defeat the purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">Mediation is an informal and voluntary process. It is better that the Bill remain silent on the question of representation at mediation and leave it to the skill and experience of the mediator to manage the process. Either party may withdraw from the mediation process at any time. We do not want to create a legalistic process or necessarily require joint sessions to be held, or to create this paraphernalia around the mediation process. That is why the Bill seeks to remain silent and seeks to use the experience of the mediator to find solutions, but in the knowledge that anyone can always have a person who represents them and that anyone can withdraw from the process at any stage. We are not being prescriptive and I believe that is the correct approach. I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">There is concern that when an employer reneges on a mediated settlement, an employee will have to take a costly breach of contract action through the civil courts. This amendment seeks to ensure that mediated settlements are enforced in the same manner as adjudicated Labour Court decisions are enforced. This is already the case under section 91 of the Employment Equality Acts, which the Government is seeking to repeal in this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">The Equality Rights Alliance has raised a number of concerns with regard to the legislation. As the Minister knows, not all of the employment cases before the Workplace Relations Commission will fall into one specific area, and I understand ICTU has also raised concerns on this. For example, a case dealing with a breach of employment may also include a discrimination dimension. The Equality Tribunal does not operate like an ordinary court in that it investigates cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Equality officers will have wide reaching powers, such as the power to compel witnesses. These cases are not reliant on legal arguments as presented by a complainant or respondent. Cases of discrimination are unique in that the burden of proof passes to the respondent once the complainant has made the <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination. In short, there is concern that future adjudication officers will not be adequately trained to deal with the equal status cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">The proposed amendment is not appropriate. The new workplace relations commission, WRC, will operate to the highest standards and appropriate and comprehensive training will be provided to all officers of the commissioner, including the adjudication officers. The workplace relations adjudication service will consist of a diverse group of adjudicators, comprising experienced industrial relations and HR practitioners, employment lawyers and civil servants with appropriate skills and experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> On the establishment of the WRC, the current cohort of equality officers and rights commissioners will be appointed as WRC adjudicators. These will be supplemented by a panel of external adjudicators appointed by the Minister. I have decided that the external panel of adjudicators will be appointed from three different streams, a legal stream, a HR stream and an IR stream, with equal numbers being appointed from each. The Public Appointments Service, PAS, undertook and completed a selection process in December 2014 for the external panel of the WRC adjudicators and has forwarded a list to me of individuals considered suitable for appointment to the panel.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> All successful applicants will be required to undergo an accredited adjudicator training programme, to be delivered by the National College of Ireland, which commenced on 16 January 2015. The programme will run for 20 days, until the end of March. There will then be an examination and assessment and only those who successfully complete the programme and pass the assessment will be formally appointed as WRC adjudicators and assigned cases. While it is essential that the adjudication officers of the workplace relations commission are appropriately and well trained, the question of the content of training to be provided to them is an operational matter for the commission and not a matter appropriately included in primary legislation. Therefore, I am not willing to agree to the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I have the modules of the courses and they deal with all the relevant issues. We will also retain the experience of equality officers within the service. Therefore, I believe the way we are tackling this will provide adequate capacity to deal with cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I move amendment No. 30:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_834">In page 39, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_835">“(iv)	 make a decision that a separate hearing for an employment equality case is required, in addition to a general employment rights decision,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">This goes back to the point I made earlier, that not all the cases that will be heard by the commission will fall neatly into the one area. For example, a breach in employment law may also have a discrimination element to it. How will an adjudicating officer determine an equality claim where there are parallel legislative powers under section 79 of the Employment Equality Act and then proceed to hear other aspects of the case where they have no similar powers?</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Similarly, section 95 of the Employment Equality Act provides equality officers and the director of the Equality Tribunal with the power to compel witnesses. Again, this legislation does not allow for employment law breaches.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">The Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Act will continue to govern the presentation of complaints of discrimination to the WRC and the adjudication officers will have regard to the specific provisions governing such cases in the equality Acts and not the provision of section 41. Section 41 does not apply directly to employment equality and equal status cases. Rather, sections 84 and 85 amend the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts and make them consistent with the provisions of section 41. There is no merit in requiring a separate hearing of equality cases from other employment matters which may be in dispute between an employer and employee. Therefore I will not accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The purpose of this Bill is to have a single hearing, which is what we seek to provide for. The criticism of the old procedure was that because there were different sections, there could be different hearings around the same incident. What we are trying to do is avoid that complexity by having a single hearing that deals with the issues in a comprehensive manner. What the Deputy proposes is not consistent with that aim.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">This amendment proposes to delete the words "6 months" and substitute "2 years". We seek to extend the length of time for which a complaint can be submitted, from the date of contravention. This would allow the legislation capture more of these circumstances. Where there are difficulties in the workplace, there may be a raft of reasons individuals do not submit their complaint immediately. We should not close the door too tight against those individuals and should broaden the term for bringing a complaint. All we seek to do is to enable the capture of situations of wrongdoing or difficulties, which is surely the purpose of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_852">Read together, subsections (5) and (7) of section 42 provide that the standard limitation period for bringing a complaint under employment and equality legislation will be six months from the relevant date, extendible by a further six months by an adjudication officer where the complainant has demonstrated reasonable cause for his or her delay in initiating the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">The Deputy's proposed limitation period of two years with an additional six months extension would be unworkable from a practical point of view. It would be inconsistent with the key principle running through the reforms the Bill seeks to achieve, namely, the resolution of employment-related complaints and disputes as close to the workplace as possible and at the earliest date. A period of two years within which to refer a complaint to the WRC would be unnecessarily long and unreasonable. Such a proposal would also be inconsistent with employment legislation in other EU member states and, therefore, I am not willing to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">The Deputy's proposal is not appropriate. The professional terms of engagement between parties and their professional representatives is primarily a matter of contract. Professional representatives such as lawyers are subject to statutory regulation and/or guidelines issued by their professional associations. Such professionals are also subject to the oversight of those associations in the event of a disciplinary matter arising. It would be inappropriate for the Chairman of the Labour Court to prejudge the outcome of any such disciplinary process. It is not within the scope of the Bill to provide for the regulation of professional representatives, legal or otherwise, who hold themselves out as suitably qualified or experienced in the areas of industrial relations, human resources, employment law, etc. I will, therefore, not accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> We do not intend that people be obliged to have a lawyer. We are not regulating representatives or making provision for awards of costs. What the Deputy is seeking is not appropriate under the legislation given people could represent themselves and the issue of their relationship with someone they choose to bring as a representative will not be adjudicated on by the Labour Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">While counsel and solicitors are regulated by a regulatory body and will in the future be regulated under the Legal Services Bill when enacted, other representatives for gain, in particular, are unregulated. They are entitled to charge percentage and contingency fees, which is illegal for a solicitor. They do not have to have indemnity insurance, yet many of them advertise that they provide legal services. It is important that these entities be regulated. There are many non-legal entities by which it is meant non-solicitors or counsel, trade unions or employer representative bodies with a negotiating licence that provide an excellent service. Many do not claim to be in some way legally qualified or to provide legal services and many have insurance. A world class service requires that those who are providing services for gain should be in some way regulated in order that minimum standards would be expected. This would be a protection for employers and employees and it would mean that they would know that where they pay for a service to be represented, the representative would have to meet a minimum standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">The Deputy is making an argument for statutory regulation of professional representatives but the legislation deals with the Labour Court adjudicating on cases brought before it. The cases can be brought by individuals, their trade union official or, if they choose, a lawyer but it is not appropriate that the court would seek to introduce regulatory standards in respect of various professions that might hold themselves out to assist people in presenting their case. It is not reasonable to expect the court to provide the regulatory environment for all the potential advisers that might offer their services. This is not appropriate to this Bill. I am not sure it is appropriate anyhow to adopt such an approach but it is unreasonable to expect the Labour Court to set up a regulatory structure of that nature for barristers, solicitors, trade union officials and so on when people can representative themselves. They are regulated by their trade union or professional body and that is a reasonable approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_883">People could be regulated by their own body but they may not necessarily be fit to represent someone in one of these cases, even though they might present themselves as being able to do so. If individuals choose to represent themselves, that is fine but professionals could say they will look after them and it will only cost so much where many of those making appeals do not understand much about the law or regulation and their entitlements. Some people are naive and they may employ professionals who might not be fit to represent them and agree to pay them. I accept the Minister's comment that where people can represent themselves, we cannot introduce such a regulation but, generally, the employee will be in a vulnerable position, more so than the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">More often than not, anyone looking for money from a financial institution can be in a vulnerable position. The person is in a weaker place than the institution as it is the one with the money and the one who knows the game. The guy going in is trying to start a business or invest in something. He is not always on a stronger footing than the guy across the table with whom he is dealing. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> Likewise, many employees might not be quite as strong and know as much as they should about how they should go about presenting the best case. Can the Minister envisage a scenario where people out there may say "oh, I'll sort that for you but it will cost you this much."? Would it close off that possible weakness?</p>

          <p eId="para_887">There is a certain validity in what the Minister has said. We are dealing with how workers enforce their legal employment rights but it is a legal process that should be accessible. I would be somebody who has often gone into the Labour Court representing people even though I do not have any professional qualifications per se other than what I learned on the shop floor and a certain knowledge. That accessibility needs to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> However, we need to address people promoting themselves as representatives and legal experts, being unregulated, purporting to represent workers' rights and not being able to do so. Sometimes people have been very badly let down by their unions or representatives and have no right to recourse. Perhaps the Minister is saying that this is not the Bill in which that very valid concern can be addressed but I hope that he would recognise that it is a valid concern. Workers certainly have recall over their representative if it is a solicitor but they need to be able to do it with a union representative or somebody posing as a legal expert. That type of regulation needs to be there. </p>

          <p eId="para_899">The Deputy's proposed amendment is inappropriate as it would have the effect of giving the District Court jurisdiction to award uncapped financial compensation in certain cases of unfair dismissal. This would be inconsistent with the status of the District Court as court of local and limited jurisdiction under the Constitution. It would also be inconsistent with the scheme of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 which provides that 104 weeks is the maximum under an unfair dismissal case. That is the maximum that an adjudication officer can award. What the Deputy is seeking to do is to allow the District Court without retrying the case to award more than that. That is where it would fall foul of the Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">The Deputy's proposal that the Labour Court be empowered in the case of a matter which has come before it on appeal from a decision of an adjudication officer to refer that matter back to another adjudication officer to be determined again at the first instance does not appear to take into consideration that on appeal, the Labour Court hears the entire case <i>de novo</i>. In the arrangement outlined in the Workplace Relations Bill 2014, both parties to a complaint have a right to have the matter heard fully on two occasions - at first instance and on appeal. This arrangement fully meets the requirements of fairness and justice. To provide an additional remedy to the Labour Court other than upholding or denying the appeal as proposed would be akin to giving the Labour Court a concurrent jurisdiction akin to judicial review - a jurisdiction that is exclusive to the High Court and the Court of Appeal on appeal therefrom.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Far from expediting proceedings, the amendment, if adopted, would serve to delay them as it would be necessary to have a minimum of three hearings and in most cases, four in place of two. Therefore, I will not accept this amendment. The strong point is that the Labour Court retries the entire case. It is not like a court that looks at the way the judge handles the matter, examines whether there was a technical breach and sends it back. It just looks at the entire merit of the case and makes a fresh decision on the entire merit. That is the approach we are adopting. </p>

The introduction of such an additional administrative layer and the consequent extension of the period for which an unprosecuted complaint would remain open is not desirable in the context of a new system which is premised on the efficient processing of cases from the perspective of both complainants and respondents. As drafted, section 50 empowers but does not compel the director general and the Labour Court to strike out a complaint or appeal that has not been prosecuted for a year or longer. In each case, the director general and the Labour Court must be satisfied the complainant-appellant has not pursued the complaint or appeal for the specified period. How the director general or Labour Court would seek to establish this to be the case in practice is an administrative matter. In practice, they will write and notify the person concerned that this has not been pursued but I do not want to extend this or provide another round in this as the Deputy would do with his amendment.</p>

The amendment would provide a safeguard against this type of victimisation. It is important that we make such a statement in the legislation in order to give confidence to workers. The Minister will likely argue that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the structures and mechanisms for dealing with complaints and is not necessarily concerned with the primary rights and entitlements of workers but there is a lack of universal protections for employees facing discrimination, victimisation or blacklisting. The Government needs to strengthen workers' confidence by removing the fear of retaliation.</p>

Section 15 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act provides that part-time employees may not be penalised for claiming their rights.

I recognise it is not the Minister's intention to introduce fees but the legislation enables a successor to do so and, therefore, we have to address that possibility. Research carried out in Britain by the Citizens Advice Bureau found that seven out of ten potentially successful cases that employees could have taken against their employers did not proceed following the introduction of a fee system. Between October 2013 and March 2014, there was a decrease of 73% in the number of cases being taken compared to the previous year. One example identified in the research involved a man who worked as a kitchen porter for 40 hours per week for more than two months and was thereby entitled to holiday pay of less than £300. He abandoned his case after being told that his fee for accessing the tribunal would be £390. In other words, he would have incurred a net loss if he had accessed the structures designed to vindicate his rights. </p>

          <p eId="para_926">I strongly support this amendment. It is uncanny to see the amount of social legislation that is pushed in this State on foot of what happens in Britain. The evidence from Britain is indisputable in this regard. The introduction of fees for these cases was a tactic aimed at denying workers the ability to access the industry relations machinery of the State. Once this provision is in the legislation, a successor to the Minister could introduce fees. We need only look at the attempts to charge money for freedom of information requests or planning applications to see how fees deter ordinary people from seeking justice. I do not think there is any justification for fees. The ability to enforce one's legal rights in respect of employment should be facilitated through an accessible public service which is not subject to a charge.</p>

          <p eId="para_934">The chairman of the Labour Court lacks the power to nominate other persons in the event of a conflict of interest. Equality legislation gives such powers to the director of the Equality Tribunal but they are not provided elsewhere in legislation. The number of members of the Labour Court will be relatively small and problems arose in the past where members knew one of the parties involved. A completely independent division should be appointed for the purpose of ensuring a completely fair hearing. It could arise, for example, that a member of the workplace relations commission brings a claim. Members of the Labour Court would know this individual from meeting him or her on a daily basis but they would have to hear the case despite the possible perception of prejudice. The Labour Court considers matters impartially but even in the High Court judges excuse themselves. There are sufficient judges to avoid any perceived prejudices but with only four divisions in the Labour Court, there is potential for every member of the court to know a particular employee or employer.</p>

          <p eId="para_935">The Bill makes adequate provision for an increase in the staffing of the Labour Court and for temporary appointments to the court to cover certain absences of a full-time officer or member. There is no case to support the creation of a panel of temporary members. The Labour Court is bound to act judicially at all times and to avoid bias or the perception thereof. When the new appointments to the Labour Court envisaged in the Bill have been made, the court will consist of 13 officers or members. This will allow for a significantly increased number of combinations of personnel to deal with any particular case and thus considerably reduces the possibility of a division of the Labour Court having to recuse itself to avoid the perception of bias. For this reason I am not accepting the amendment. I am also establishing a new division of the Labour Court, with an extra deputy chair, and a second person who will have a roving brief. This will further increase the strength of the court.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_948">"(2) Section 1(3) of the Act of 1984 is amended by the insertion of the following paragraph:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_949">"(e) the employer is deemed to be insolvent in circumstances where he has ceased trading and payments to employees have been determined by the Minister to have <i>de facto</i> been stopped on a permanent basis for a period of six weeks or more.".".</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The Paris Bakery, Vita Cortex, La Senza, HMV, Game, Thomas Cook, Connolly Shoes and the old Darnely Lodge in Meath were all shocking situations where workers who had lost their jobs were made to wait extended periods before their legal entitlements were awarded. There is a gap in the legislation which allows unscrupulous employers simply to walk away from their obligations and leave hundreds of workers in the wind. Families were left trying to pay mortgages and rent, to feed and clothe themselves and ensure children got to school. It is a significant issue. It was only in June 2014 that the Paris Bakery issue was resolved. These issues are being resolved not because of the actions of Government but for other reasons. It is a very serious issue that while the Government offers tea and sympathy, it will not necessarily do anything about these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_951"> I have put legislation before the Oireachtas previously and here I suggest a mechanism by which we can try to seek resolution of this issue. Amendment No. 51 seeks to amend the interpretation section of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to enable workers to access the insolvency fund where their former employee has ceased to trade and is, in effect, insolvent but has not been formally placed in liquidation, receivership, declared legally bankrupt, died or been deemed insolvent under legislation in another EU member state.</p>

          <p eId="para_952">The proposed amendment goes way beyond the scope of the legislation. The Deputy is seeking to introduce a new procedure for adjudicating on insolvent companies. The issue he raises is on access to the insolvency fund and the Minister for Social Protection is reviewing the position on informal insolvencies to establish what can be done, if anything, to progress payments to individuals in situations where employers cease trading without engaging in a formal winding up process and owe moneys to their employees. The Minister is examining access to the insolvency fund, which offers protection to workers, but introducing legislation of this sort in relation to companies and how they are deemed insolvent is way beyond the scope of this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">It seems to go way beyond the scope of the Government. We are four years into its term of office yet this is one of the first issues that fell heavily upon the Oireachtas as soon as we walked in the door after the last general election. There was an avalanche of companies going to the wall in this way. Looking at it does not afford protections; only through legislation can we achieve that. I ask the Minister to imagine he is back in 2010 and canvassing during the election. Would he say to an interviewer that every opportunity the Government gets to fix a problem will be missed and the issue pushed over to another Bill? I have come at the Minister at every opportunity to resolve this. Every Bill that lends itself to potentially resolving this is described by the Minister as "not the right place for it". The Minister is not searching for the right place. We should take advantage of every opportunity to resolve this.</p>

If the decision is not made within 60 days, the Minister will have to make a statement on it within 30 days. It is further proposed that the Minister should publish further updates at 30-day intervals until such time as the matter is determined. Like the legislation, amendment No. 54 makes provision for a person who has not had a decision from the Minister under section 6 of the 1984 Act to make a complaint to the tribunal. It is a system that motivates a Minister who is standing idly by to act on behalf of workers who simply want to be paid their wages, holiday pay and redundancy. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that he is proactive in taking any opportunity that presents itself finally to resolve this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_955">Having had a bit of experience in this area, I understand the principle behind Deputy Tóibín's amendment. I do not know either where the right place to address this issue is, but it would be hard to argue that workers' rights had not been undermined to a great degree over the past 30 years. As an employer running into difficulty, the bank may pull the plug on one. It happened to a lot of companies which dramatically ceased to trade. Sometimes, workers lost out. It is not black and white but is a complex area. I do not know of examples where this has been put in place, but the erosion of workers' rights is not confined to Ireland. Workers' rights have been eroded across the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> There should be a mechanism in place whereby workers are taken care of before the financial institutions. If one was a financial institution, one might say that one would not lend money out if that were the case. However, legislation might provide that to some degree - and I am not talking about an unlimited scenario - workers' rights should be addressed before those of financial institutions. If a financial institution is lending money to a construction company which is involved in development over 15 years, it will make a larger profit on its investment over the period than the worker who provides his service to the employer. More often than not, the worker does not have the same potential to accumulate a serious profit on a weekly basis. Obviously, with some work he can put away some money, but his opportunities are not as great as those of the financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> If the financial institutions were to take a small bit more of a hit to ensure that the worker was taken care of first, it would not be such a mad scenario. Perhaps it would be regarded as revolutionary, but it would be a very positive step. I do not know either if this is the right Bill in which to include such a provision. The Minister argues that it is not. However, will the Minister consider in principle the idea of putting in place a protection for workers where a company is forced to cease trading dramatically and without being in a position to prepare itself so as to take care of its workers before the banks move in?</p>
          <p eId="para_958">It would be very positive if the Government could consider this area. What does the Minister think about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_959">I support the spirit of the amendments. There have been situations, some that received publicity and some that did not, in which workers have been left high and dry while other creditors were catered for. Workers have been forced to occupy places of employment in order to get basic rights. The amendments would establish an institution that would, hopefully, give workers much quicker access to their rights in the event of a dispute. The inclusion of the amendments would send a message that in the event of the forced closure of a business, workers cannot be treated as some sort of commodity, that they are people rather than some sort of fixture or fitting that can be discarded with no notice or regard for the consequences. The inclusion of these amendments, or something similar, or a commitment by the Minister to frame something that could be included in the legislation that will establish what will be the primary agency in the country for attaining one's employment rights when it comes before the Seanad, would send a strong message about where this country's interest lies.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_960">Under our system of company law, workers, as creditors, take precedence over unsecured creditors when a company is wound up. The State has also provided the insolvency fund to protect workers when a company winds up. The difficulty the Deputy raises is a situation in which a company does not go into insolvency. In this case, the hope is that employees would get the money from the company. While a company might go to the courts to wind it up, it probably would not have resources from which employees might get a return. The issue is how employees can access the insolvency fund, which was established as a State protection for workers. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is examining the issue. This will not be resolved by finding a super role for the Minister within company legislation in the realm of insolvencies. The problem is access to the insolvency fund, which is a State-provided safety net. The approach proposed by the Deputy is not the right one.</p>

          <p class="indent_6" eId="para_1117">(ii) with the consent of the employee, within the period of 6 months after the end of that leave year, or</p>

          <p class="indent_7" eId="para_1119">(I) is, due to illness, unable to take all or any part of his or her annual leave during that leave year or the period specified in subparagraph (ii), and</p>
          <p class="indent_7" eId="para_1120">(II) has provided a certificate of a registered medical practitioner in respect of that illness to his or her employer, within the period of 15 months after the end of that leave year.”.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1121">(2) Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 is amended, in paragraph (a) of subsection (3), by the deletion of “(other than established civil servants within the meaning of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956)”.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1122">(3) Section 2B (inserted by section 2 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 is repealed.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Amendment No. 55 provides for the amendment of section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to provide that for the purposes of the entitlement to paid annual leave provided for in section 19(1), an employee who is absent from the workplace on certified sick leave will be deemed to have worked on a day of illness the hours he or she would have worked on that day, had it not been a day of illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">This amendment implements the key principle established by the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in the Schultz-Hoff-Stringer line of cases that employees can accrue statutory annual leave while out of work due to illness. It also provides for the amendment of section 20 of the 1997 Act to provide that where an employee has been unable to take annual leave due to absence from work on sick leave, the timeframe for taking the annual leave accrued during a particular leave year shall be extended to a carry-over period of 15 months following the end of that leave year. The amendment also gives effect to, and is in line with, the main findings of the KHS case which was that the EU working time directive permits national law to put a cap on the unlimited accumulation of paid annual leave during successive periods of absence on sick leave. I am satisfied that the 15 month carry-over period strikes the right balance between respecting the rights of vulnerable workers who absent from work due to a serious illness and trying to minimise the cost to business and the Exchequer. </p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> This amendment also makes provision for subsection (2) of the new section 87 in relation to section 23(3)(a) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 by the deletion of "other than established civil servants within the meaning of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956". This amendment, subject to designation by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will provide access for established civil servants to the normal industrial relations machinery of the State, namely, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and the soon to be established workplace relations commission. Currently, civil servants, unlike the majority of workers in the State, avail of a conciliation and arbitration scheme. This is an enabling measure and any actual changes to procedures will only be undertaken in consultation with all stakeholders, including the relevant Civil Service unions and the LRC, Labour Court and workplace relations commission, as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> Subsection (3) of the new section 87 provides for the deletion of section 2B of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2009. Section 2B was inserted into the FEMPI Act by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 as a limited contingency measure in the event that no collective agreement was concluded with staff associations and trade unions following the negotiations leading up to the Haddington Road agreement. This section would have, should the need have arisen, allowed public service employers to take steps that would impact on non-core pay and working hours of staff in their organisations to effect savings. In the event, the public service unions and associations signed up to the Haddington Road agreement, which has produced a significant dividend to the public finances while, crucially, maintaining industrial peace. The removal of section 2B is in recognition that any requirement for this measure has now passed. All other provisions provided under the FEMPI Acts 2009 and 2013 remain in place and form a continuing necessary component of the fiscal consolidation programme to achieve the general government deficit target below 3% of GDP by 2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_1130">It seems such a basic right that any facility would be accessible to people with disabilities. I am not sure why the amendment has been ruled out of order. Perhaps it is the case that there could be a cost implication and as a result as an opposition party Sinn Féin is prohibited in that regard. Given that the Minister will have an opportunity to make such an amendment in the Seanad perhaps he would comment briefly on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1134">On the matter raised by Deputy Tóibín, the workplace relations commission will be bound by the Disability Act, which is the parent legislation that provides the rights for persons with a disability. That legislation is comprehensive in its provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> I take this opportunity to thank Deputies for their participation in passing this legislation, which is a major piece of public service reform. Huge efforts have been made by a number of agencies in working out a coherent form of interaction and a world-class system that it is hoped will encourage compliance and, where compliance does not occur, will provide clean and easy access by people to having their rights vindicated and also provides for penalty clauses that are enforceable. I am conscious that further provisions are required. I have indicated on a number of occasions on Report Stage that I propose to take on board some of the suggestions made by Deputies which will strengthen the Bill, particularly those relating to the creation of an offence of non-compliance with an order of the District Court to enforce decisions of the workplace relations commission or Labour Court under employment legislation. Many people are frustrated about the enforceability of some of these decisions. It is an area in respect of which I propose to introduce amendments in the Seanad. I will revert to Deputies if I get the support of the Seanad for those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> I thank my officials for the huge amount of work they have done on this Bill. I also thank the Oireachtas committee and Deputies who enabled passage of this legislation. I hope it will bring about improvement in the way this process works.

          <p eId="para_1142">È possible per me a parlare in Italiano? We can legislate until the cows come home. However, unless there is a mindset to ensure provisions are adhered to, legislative provisions will not materialise. The perfect example is building regulations. We probably have as good a building regulations system as any other country but because we do not implement them or carry out proper inspections, we end up with some very poor buildings. Likewise, this legislation should bring improvements in workplace and employment conditions. It is important that it is not just on paper but made a reality. That will require funding, too. It is important that the State be prepared to back it up with whatever funding is necessary to ensure it becomes a reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_1144">It will be two minutes for each of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> I extend my full support and that of the Anti-Austerity Alliance to the teachers, who are facing into strike action tomorrow. I am a member of the ASTI. I do not know if I am the only ASTI member in the Dáil who supports the teachers, but I am not the only ASTI member. In the short time I have, I want to put this strike in context. Teachers are taking a stance against changed work practices. They are workers. They are allowed to object to an increase in their workload or a change in their work practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> They are also taking a stand for the education system itself. I am not one to quote Senator Fidelma Healy Eames on a regular basis, but she is quoted today as saying that this is "the tip of the iceberg for teacher assessment when compared with the 100% teacher assessment in place in other countries". That is what this is about. It is about an attempt to have all certification of students done at a local, school-based level. One begins with the junior certificate at 40%, then moves to 100%. Then one will move to the leaving certificate. An Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, made it clear in the programme for Government that a new system of self-evaluation would be introduced, requiring all schools to evaluate their own performance, year-on-year, and publish information across a wide range of criteria. In other words, league tables and schools competing with each other. This is about the commercialisation of the education system. I also object to things that Ministers have said. The idea that teachers are encouraging rote learning on a daily basis is an insult. If one moves to assessment, what do they think teachers will be spending their time doing then? They will be trying to get students through the assessments. In particular, working class students and students in disadvantaged areas who do not have the cultural capital of their parents to help them at home will be very reliant on the teachers to get them through those hoops.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> There is no benefit in this for students. I urge parents to come out and support the students, to make it clear that the examinations should be anonymous, they should be beyond reproach, and teachers should not mark their own students for State examinations and accreditation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1148">Any reform taken in the education system must keep students and the quality of education they receive at its heart. The workload capacity of teachers must also be taken into account and it must be realistic in what it expects to deliver. The junior cycle reform proposed by this Government is more focused on cost-cutting in an already decimated sector, rather than on the provision and integrity of a quality examination. The word "reform" is being used to disguise more cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> Recently, the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, referred to the upcoming strike as unnecessary, demonstrating a clear disregard for the voices of the 27,000 teachers represented by the TUI and ASTI. The concerns of teachers regarding the proposed changes have been ignored from the start of this process, an attitude made abundantly clear in the fact that only a single day of in-service training was offered prior to the proposed implementation of the new junior cycle English course. One day is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> Sure, the junior certificate needs to be reformed. The junior certificate is an important part of preparation for the leaving certificate and any reform should take into account best practice at leaving certificate level. The system of oral examination in the leaving certificate involves external assessment, with students being examined by teachers from other schools. This upholds the fairness and integrity of the examination and should also apply to the junior certificate, instead of the current confusing optional oral system, which is an example of a half-baked reform. This Government talks about the need for reform, but then refuses to spend the money required to provide a better system, based on best practice. I have a friend, Tricia, who teaches in Dublin. She recently carried out a survey of junior certificate students, where she proposed that the mock junior certificate be marked in-house. There was overwhelming opposition to it as students demanded independent assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> Lack of consultation with teachers and students by the State authorities means that we have another strike tomorrow. Communication does help. Everyone accepts that change needs to happen, but it must be done in consultation with teachers and students.</p>

          <p eId="para_1152">The Taoiseach made the point earlier that students and parents do not want a strike, with the implication that teachers in some way did want a strike, which is a ridiculous proposition. Teachers would far prefer to be in the classroom, doing their job. He is not just wrong in that. My daughter, who is a junior certificate student, is happy that the teachers are going on strike, not because they are getting a day off, but because she and her peers recognise the difficulties they would have if it was left to their teachers to evaluate them. They know how difficult that would be, human nature being what it is. As a parent of a junior certificate student, I am also happy that teachers are making that stand. I am not happy that they have to, but I am happy that the assault on teachers' working conditions and wages over the past number of years has not eroded their principles. It has not diminished their resolve to make a stand when it is important to do so. This is the only avenue they have to force the Government to listen. I salute them in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> Does anybody out there support the junior certificate as it stands? Probably not, but delivering an alternative education system that is better for students cannot be done without engaging with the teaching staff who are at the coalface. That is, in essence, what this dispute has originated from. The Government has failed to listen and I am glad that the teachers are taking it on. Fintan O'Toole very eloquently addressed the issues with our education system. He made the point that examinations are brutal, mechanical and depersonalising and the system we have devalues many of the things that should be stimulated in young people - creativity, cooperation and so on - but the examination system has a shining light to it in that it is impersonal. Everybody is treated the same; it does not matter who one is. That is a very valuable proposition in our education system. I hope the Government takes note and listens to what those at the coalface are saying.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1154">I am speaking from my 35 years' experience of teaching in a second-level school, teaching both the old intermediate certificate and the junior certificate. With my teaching colleagues, we have embraced a myriad of changes through the years. Some of those changes included assessment. For example, a long time ago, there was a junior cycle programme in history, geography and social studies, with the projects corrected by the teachers, but there was cross-moderation. This was organised through the curriculum development unit. There were other projects for environment and social studies and again they were corrected by the teachers but with an independent examiner. Today, teachers do correct the leaving certificate applied and one third of the credits are from teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> Teachers have embraced continuous assessment, but they have genuine concerns over correcting their own students in the junior certificate. The current system is fair, objective and transparent. The new proposal undermines that. There will be pressure on teachers to alter marks, in the same way there is pressure on lecturers at third level to alter the marks of students who are dissatisfied with the mark they receive. We know there is competition between schools for numbers and there is always a type of league table in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> A form of continuous assessment is already in place, in that teachers give homework, they have class tests and they have Christmas and summer tests. They are also involved in giving their students projects and teachers value the skills that come about through project work. All that assessment is continuous. The teachers keep the records. They have the marks and the grades to discuss with their students and at parent-teacher meetings. I would like to see that included in some way. Not 40% - that is far too much - but all that work should be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> Rote-learning does have a place. It complements independent thinking. I taught both English and history and there was a place for rote-learning in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> My other major concern is about the depth of the learning experience. The proposed statements of learning undermine that. As someone who taught history, I have spoken about this with the Minister, because there are grave issues regarding the teaching of history and geography, but I also know from talking to friends who teach other subjects that they have concerns about that learning experience.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1159">I am keen to record my support for the teachers' strike action tomorrow. Furthermore, I record my support for this Private Members' motion. In supporting the motion, I use the term "junior cycle change" rather than "junior cycle reform", because reform infers upgrading and improvement. However, I believe the proposed changes, far from improving second level education will be detrimental to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> It is important to recall where these proposals and changes came from initially. They came from the last Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government as part of austerity or cost-cutting measures. There is no doubt that successive budgets from this Government and the previous Government have cut vast resources out of education. Schools and teachers are now at breaking point in this regard. Indeed, there was a further cut of 1% this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> Second level schools in Ireland are all locally based and rightly so. A major strength of the set-up is the closeness of teachers to the community. I believe that having teachers assess their own students cannot but damage the relationship between teachers and students, teachers and schools and teachers and the community. Moreover, it will undermine confidence in second level qualifications generally and, as a result, it will have a detrimental effect on students, particularly students from disadvantaged schools. On this basis I call on the Minister to defer the implementation of these changes until there is agreement with the teachers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1163">It is a short time in which to speak. The issue we are debating is the question of reform of the junior cycle. It is worth pointing out that this is not a new subject that has only been debated in recent times. I have counted nine consecutive Ministers with responsibility for education, including the current Minister, who have discussed this subject at various times during their tenure. I stopped counting after that. This covered the period when we were told that we were the richest little country in the world. Even during that period discussions were under way on this subject and those discussions included the trade unions at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> This system has existed for over 20 years. As legislators and educators we know that no system is perfect. As society and the world changes, our education systems should come up for scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> I always take this back to the basic point about education. In society, particularly Irish society, the greatest level of discrimination against the poorest takes place in education. People refer to the junior cycle and the leaving certificate as a good thing, etc. However, if it is such a great system and not to be tampered with or discussed, why is it that in recent years such a small proportion of working class children get past the door of a university? If it is so good, why has it not been good to them? The system should be up for scrutiny, as should all things in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166"> As a former member of the school board in Old Bawn Community School, Tallaght, I take a different view from some people. Let us consider the stress that this system loads on children aged only 14 and a half or 15 years. Such pressures should not be put on any children. Any child can continue to learn without such pressure. I have held this view for 20 years. It should be discontinued and replaced with a different system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1167">I thank Deputy Maloney for two minutes of his time. I will not exceed my time. The Teachers Union of Ireland has objected to some of the Minister's proposed reforms. However, I believe they are necessary and long overdue. I am particularly surprised at the TUI objections because the union has been a progressive presence in Irish education at second level, in further education and in higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> As we know, education operates within a given social and economic context. This context is subject to change and at the moment the context is subject to rapid change and challenge. There is a requirement for new skills, new competencies and new modes of learning to match the changing world of work and employment. The context is pressing. New content requires new modes of assessment and the Minister is simply responding to that requirement. I believe the Minister is doing no more than her job requires and I support her in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1169">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this motion. It is over a quarter of a century since the current junior certificate was established. At the time, for many students it was the last formal examination. Now, thankfully, only approximately 10% of children leave formal education at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> Our focus should be on the learning process and the skills learned rather than the outcome of an examination. We can all agree that those leaving school in 1989 faced very different challenges from those leaving school in 2015 and beyond. Educational theory has moved on significantly in the meantime. Now, the emphasis is on teaching children life skills as opposed to learning by rote.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> When the proposals for overhauling the junior cycle were initially mooted, real fear was expressed by students, parents and teachers about the fairness of students' teachers marking their work. However, in the intervening period much has been done to allay some of these fears. For example, the current proposal is that final examinations would account for 60% of the junior cycle marks. Furthermore, these examinations would be set and marked by the State Examinations Commission. The proposal has allayed the fears of many in respect of that reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> What remains is 40% of the marks. Recent years have seen an increased emphasis on portfolio and project work, group work and oral testing. It is only sensible that these be assessed on a continual basis with appropriate external checks to ensure fairness. Much of the focus has been on the marking structure of the examination. The 40% continuous assessment element reflects best practice. There is an acceptance of continuous assessment and non-examination-based assessment in countries throughout Europe. Rather than focusing on examinations, our focus should be on what children are learning during this important three-year period. In particular, I welcome the focus on health and well-being; physical education; social, personal and health education; and civic, social and political education. The focus has followed from consultation with young people who have sought for a greater emphasis to be placed on social and life skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> The change to the junior certificate is not about saving money. Rather, it is about using the knowledge gained about best practice and teenage learning in the past two or three decades and putting that in place in Irish classrooms to ensure that students learn skills that will be of value during their lives rather than sitting in silence and learning off long tracts of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174"> I believe the Minister has taken on board the real concerns of teachers in an even-handed manner. This is reflected in the reduced level of school-based assessment. However, Ireland is already out of step in terms of the European experience in embracing the importance of ongoing assessment and the move away from a reliance on end-of-year written examinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> When consulted about the junior certificate reform representatives from Dáil na nÓg stated that the junior certificate, as it currently stands, is essentially a memory test. They found this to be a negative form of assessment which leads to undue stress for many. The voice of those sitting the examinations is important. Education is now a collaborative affair between students and teachers and it is only right that their views are taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176"> I believe that necessary safeguards can be put in place to ensure the fairness of the overall result in respect of the written examination and the school-based assessment. Once new structures are agreed by all parties we can move forward with a junior cycle that reflects best practice internationally, one that rewards real learning as opposed to rote learning and one that will properly equip students for life in 21st century Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Lyons<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1177">I suppose most people who know anything about me know that I worked as a secondary school teacher for 13 years. I come to the House in as impartial a manner as possible with no desire for point-scoring or anything like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178"> Deputy Coppinger and myself trained together as teachers back in 1998. Curriculum and assessment was one element of our post-graduate course which was taught by Professor Ted Wragg, one of the best known British educationalists for more than 30 years. He died about ten years ago, having written more than 50 books on education. I still remember one quote from him during the curriculum and assessment module of my higher diploma from almost 20 years ago. He said that assessment is the tail that wags the curriculum dog. That says much more than the number of words in the sentence. </p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> Back in 1989 I was one of the first students to do the new junior certificate, which was supposed to be the bells and whistles in terms of offering a new type of education to young people. However, it did nothing more than what the intermediate certificate had done before it. We had a new scheme and a new concept but we never changed the assessment process. We left it as a terminal examination at the end of year three. The examination was marked independently, which has its merits admittedly. We never changed the assessment process but did deliver a new curriculum which was supposed to equip people like myself and those who came after me with new skills that we could bring with us throughout our lives, such as becoming reflective learners, reflective practitioners, capable of engaging in group work and so forth. The reality is, however, that we never changed the assessment process. </p>
          <p eId="para_1180"> If we are to have any sort of new cycle - in this case the junior cycle - we need to have a new assessment process. That assessment process must be able to learn what is going on in the classroom. How many people here have done an examination at some stage in their lives and had a bad day? Something might have gone wrong on the way into the examination. That can happen, whether one is 15 or 25. One can have a bad day and it is wrong to judge people on three years of work in a two-hour examination at the end of the cycle. That does not reflect the quality of work that somebody might have put in over those three years. It does not reflect the commitment someone may have made in trying to speak French in class during all of that time or the amount of time spent practising and going back over work. </p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> The proposal that is before us genuinely offers a new assessment process which will take into account the real learning that young people should be experiencing and not just their ability to look at the geography examination papers from the past ten years and remember how to draw a map. If a student can remember how to do that, he or she is 30% of the way towards passing junior certificate geography. That is not acceptable for me as a teacher. I committed myself to being a teacher because I believe in the betterment of young people. I genuinely believe that most teachers would have no problem with what I have said here tonight. They go into teaching because of the belief they have in young people. They want the best for young people. However, I acknowledge that there is an issue at the moment. I have no particular opinion on what the teachers will do tomorrow - that is their decision and they have good reasons for making it. </p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> At the centre of these changes is our young people and our desire for a better society - a better, well-equipped and more mature society with young people who have the skills to get the best out of life. The assessment process to which Professor Wragg referred is about not allowing the curriculum to be led by the examination. It is about letting the learning lead the way. However, we cannot do this without teacher support. Teachers are pressed already. They are working 33 periods plus five additional periods under the Haddington Road agreement. They do not have a minute in school. We can deliver a new school-based assessment process that involves teachers only if we bring those teachers with us. I believe that teachers will come with us, provided we change the work practices in schools. They cannot do this on top of the work they are doing right now. I support the junior certificate reform proposals and the Government's motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">Some of the opposition to the proposed reforms by some of the opposition Members is a knee-jerk reaction. I take as an example the contribution from Deputy Clare Daly, to which I listened in my office. Her response was very much based on the premise that if the Government is for it and the unions are against it, then she should oppose it. On the Sinn Féin position, it was my impression that the party was not opposed in principle to the reforms until very recently.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">They are just being politically opportunist. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, referred in depth to Sinn Féin statements on the issue which showed that the party was not opposed to the reform programme originally. The party's approach now is based purely on political opportunism and has a lot to do with its own connections within the trade union movement. Sinn Féin is not prepared to show leadership on an issue that concerns the future of young people in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> This debate is all about why we need a State examination and the idea that the junior certificate is a high-stakes examination. Why do we need a high-stakes examination for people who are 15 and who are going to sit the leaving certificate examination? That is the real high-stakes examination. Nobody here goes around saying "I got X, Y or Z in my junior certificate". When one goes looking for a job, it is all about the leaving certificate and if people do not have the leaving certificate, it is about the FETAC qualifications they have. If one visits community employment schemes - as I did recently - one finds that it is all about getting those who do not have a leaving certificate a FETAC qualification at level 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. It is all about bringing them up through the FETAC levels. Other countries do not have a high-stakes examination for 15 year olds so why do we need one? There is no need for it and the idea that we need it is pure superstition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> The people who were dropping out of education and not doing the leaving certificate were the people who were being failed by the junior certificate most of all. If one listens to the debate involving leaders of the ASTI and the TUI, they argued that it is the other 80% who matter in the context of grades and so forth. This system is failing the people who do not do the leaving certificate and it is them about whom we should be thinking. Studies have been done on the transition from school into work or third level education. They have found that the junior cycle reforms that were introduced 25 years ago were not radical enough and therefore teachers just reverted and continued to teach for the examination. Students, at 14 or 15, were disengaging from the system, particularly young men from disadvantaged communities whom Sinn Féin would like to think it represents. Sinn Féin is very wrong on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188"> Why do the unions - the ASTI and the TUI - not trust the professionalism of teachers? That question was referred to by Senator Healy Eames in an article in the <i>Irish Independent </i>today. The unions trust our teachers at primary level, in further education and at university but they do not trust second level teachers. Somehow they will be corrupt in a way that other teachers are not. What a damning indictment of the profession that is. </p>
          <p eId="para_1189"> The Government's approach is the right one. There will be FETAC-level qualifications for those who complete the new reformed certificate. As has been said, there has been significant compromise already. If we want to do something to reform the system then these proposals are the way to go.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1190">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to evaluate our position with regard to the junior cycle examinations. It is 26 years since the present system was introduced and the changes in our society in that time have been vast. I came into the House around that time and there is no comparison between our society then and now. Enormous changes have taken place in our economy and particularly in opportunities for accessing data. Information is available at the touch of a button now. One does not need rote learning to obtain information. I remember using the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> at school, which had an updated volume every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">I have not seen a copy of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> for years because it has been made obsolete by modern technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192"> Students need quality learning. Assessing information and subjects is one thing, and it is accepted that some degree of assessment will take place, but how does one assess the issues that assist young persons to deal with society in adulthood? How does one assess entrepreneurship, which is very important, and develop the qualities required to become an entrepreneur? How does one prepare a student for the pressures society imposes on young people and families? Society has changed dramatically since the current system was introduced. </p>
          <p eId="para_1193"> In addition to giving students facts, education should prepare them for life which has become vastly different for this generation as compared to previous generations. Change is required in the assessment process in the junior cycle. Other issues must be included in the junior certificate and students must be involved and taught to use their critical faculties. The purpose of the new junior cycle is to make fundamental changes to learning and teaching in response to modern requirements and equip young people to deal with a rapidly changing society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194"> The new proposals will change the dynamic of the classroom. This cannot be done by external assessment only. The teaching profession can respond to the needs of classes and evaluate them on the basis of where the students are, rather than by comparing them with students from different schools. The new approach will result in a greater level of objectivity in examining the development of individual students and recognise the skills that cannot be assessed through an examination process. </p>
          <p eId="para_1195"> The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in collaboration with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, consulted Dáil na nÓg on the reform of the junior cycle. It was interesting to note the response of the young people who make up Dáil na nÓg. It concluded that the majority of young people considered the junior curriculum to be too focused on examinations and the junior certificate examination to be a negative form of assessment which caused stress and was essentially a memory test. </p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1196">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. Notwithstanding the differences between the teaching unions and the Minister, the proposals for junior cycle reform are exciting and present an opportunity to think outside the box. The purpose of the reform is not to achieve rationalisation, such as has been required in all other Departments and areas of the public sector in recent years, but to introduce new ways of learning and measuring learning. It takes account of the changes in society since 1989, which seems like only yesterday. It is scary to think that time seems to pass much faster than in the past. This may be connected to the abundance of information and many accoutrements available to us now. We have computers and mobile telephones and new forms of communication. Immense changes have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197"> Socially, young people have changed in the way they receive knowledge and information. We need to equip them with different types of tools for learning. One of the buzzwords we hear is that learning is "lifelong". Students do not stop learning when they learn poetry for an examination. Instead, they are empowered and enabled to embrace learning as a lifelong endeavour. There is something new to learn every day if one has the right disposition and attitude. This facilitates thinking outside the box.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198"> The proposed junior cycle reform is an exciting development. I initially agreed with the arguments presented against the reform by teachers, perhaps because I am a little old-fashioned. Ireland has a fine education system as the achievements of the country attest. Young people who were educated under the current system and subsequently moved abroad are performing in an exemplary manner in many walks of life. I hope many of them will return to our shores and help us to build the country as the economy improves. </p>
          <p eId="para_1199"> Despite the strike action proposed for tomorrow, I have no doubt that discussions can make progress. The Minister has an appetite for achieving a solution. Deputy Neville referred to the thought, focus, research and consultation that has been invested in the reform proposals by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the statutory body with responsibility for the curriculum. The NCCA also studied other jurisdictions with high levels of educational attainment and high performing education systems. I have no doubt a solution to the current problems will be found. Strike action is not the only way forward. This is a democracy and we must talk. Teachers are competent and capable of teasing out the issues. Many education professionals support the implementation of the proposed measures in respect of the junior cycle, as opposed to the leaving certificate cycle, which is a high stakes examination that leads to other paths in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200"> Education is a lifelong process and our attitude to it can be affected, formed and assisted by the proposals for junior cycle reform. Given that teachers are the guardians of the education system and have done great service to the country, I remain hopeful that a resolution will be found and they will be given the resources they need to deliver the type of reform we would all like.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201"> The amalgamation of small schools is an issue that needs to be addressed. The resources available to small schools for school transport and teaching resources are pitiful. These schools are basically left to their own devices. With enrolments declining, the amalgamation of small schools is causing acrimony in communities and among parents, patrons and boards of management. I am privy to information concerning a particular amalgamation and it appears people are being left to fend for themselves. While there are good reasons for amalgamations, support must be provided to the schools concerned. I ask the Minister to examine this issue because the current approach is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">Measaim gur rún ríthábhachtach é seo agus is oth liom roinnt de na meonta atá mé tar éis cloisteáil cheana féin ó thaobh na caoi is féidir é seo a thabhairt i gcrích. Ar dtús báire, ní féidir riamh athrú chomh suntasach a thabhairt i gcrích muna bhfuil an dara dream is tábhachtaí taobh thiar de. Is iad na páistí atá ar scoil an dream is tábhachtaí i gcónaí. Má smaoiníonn tú siar, nuair a luadh seo don chéad uair, is faoi Rialtas Fhianna Fáil a luadh é agus bhí sé i gceist acu fáil réidh go hiomlán leis an teastas sóisearach. Ní raibh siad ag smaoineamh in aon chor faoi na páistí, bhí siad ag smaoineamh ar airgead a choigilt agus sin an tosaíocht mícheart. Lean an Rialtas seo an meon sin go dtí gur athraigh an t-iarAire, an Teachta Ruairí Quinn, a intinn agus shocraigh sé an meon a athrú agus roinnt de na hábhair agus na scrúdúcháin a dhéanamh ar bhonn leanúnach. Rinne sé dearmad labhairt leis na múinteoirí agus iad siúd a labhraíonn ar son thromlach na múinteoirí, mar a bhí na ceardchumainn. Ní dhearnadh caint cheart leo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203"> Táimid den tuairim go bhfuil athruithe ag teastáil, ní hamháin leis an teastas sóisearach ach le go leor rudaí eile sa chóras oideachais freisin, toisc nach bhfuil sé go hiomlán foirfe agus ní bheidh sé riamh. Beidh athrú ag teastáil ann i gcónaí, ach sa lá atá inniu ann, san aois nuatheicneolaíochta seo, caithfimid athrú a dhéanamh, mar tá an teicneolaíocht seo ag déanamh múnlú ar aigne páistí ón gcéad bhliain nó ón dara bliain dá saol go dtí go bhfágann siad an scoil agus tá sé leanúnach. Nílimid tar éis athrú ina iomlán a dhéanamh sa tsochaí ná sa gheilleagar, ach cinnte nílimid tar éis an t-athrú sin a fheiseáil sna scoileanna. Tá fadhbanna móra againn sna scoileanna agus má tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh déileáil le hathrú agus cuidiú le páistí sa chóras oideachais, ba chóir maoiniú ceart a dhéanamh ar na scoileanna sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh teacht ag gach uile páiste, ní hamháin sna meánscoileanna ach sna bunscoileanna chomh maith, ar ríomhairí de shíor. Sin an tslí atá an tsochaí imithe. Sin an tslí a bheidh ann amach anseo. Beidh páistí, agus an domhan go léir, ag brath ar ríomhairí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204"> Fós féin, níl teacht ag páistí go leanúnach ar ríomhairí. Níl teacht acu ar sheomraí cuí chun staidéar a dhéanamh, nó ranganna beag go leor chun an t-oideachas cuí a fháil. Má tá airgead acu, ar ndóigh, is féidir leis na tuismitheoirí íoc as seo agus íoc as ranganna breise. Ní tharlóidh sé sin faoin athrú seo. Cuideoidh an t-athrú seo leis na scoileanna atá airgead acu leanúint leis an apartheid atá ann faoi láthair. Má tá airgead ag duine, gheobhaidh sé nó sí an t-oideachas is fearr sa tír seo. Ní gá féachaint ar na ceantair ina bhfuil na scoileanna is fearr agus cé hiad na tuismitheoirí atá acu. Ní hé gur scoileanna príobháideacha iad go léir ach is scoileanna iad ina bhfuil breis airgid ag na tuismitheoirí, gur féidir leo infheistiú, mar ba chóir, i dtodhchaí na bpáistí. Ní tharlaíonn an t-infheistiú sin i gceantair bhochta, in ainneoin céard a dúirt Cathaoirleach an choiste oideachais níos luaithe. Níl fiú múinteoirí cuí ag na páistí sna scoileanna seo. Níl sin ag caitheamh anuas ar na múinteoirí. Uaireanta bíonn siad imithe. Tá athrú suntasach de shíor ag teacht ar mhúinteoirí i scoileanna ina bhfuil sé níos deacra orthu múineadh, toisc an stró breise atá orthu. Ní hé an réiteach ar an bhfadhb seo ná cur leis an stró atá ar na múinteoirí agus na scoileanna. Ba cheart fáil réidh leis na ciorruithe agus ansin beidh maoiniú ceart ag na scoileanna. Is féidir ansin díriú isteach ar na hathruithe a bhfuil gá leo sa chóras. Mura tharlaíonn sé sin, ní fiú tráithnín an t-athrú seo ach amháin go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur leis an gcinedheighilt atá sa chóras oideachais sa Stát seo faoi láthair.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1205">From conversations I have had with teachers and concerned parents, I am strongly directed to the view that this Government is intent on doing away with the junior certificate without proper consultation and that its key motivation, like that of its predecessor, is saving money. The Irish education system has many flaws but the impartiality of the State examinations is one of its virtues. The Government is attempting to railroad so-called reform without teacher support or even attempting to address their real and valid concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206"> The current Government seems not in the least bit fazed by strikes or, indeed, the threat of strikes. A further day of teacher strike action is scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday. We have also seen the Minister for Health do too little and do it too late to avert a nursing staff work to rule. The Minister for Education and Skills has equally failed to address the concerns of teachers in any meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207"> I appreciate that reforms of our education system are needed. That said, I fear the removal of external examination has the potential to undermine education standards up to and beyond the junior cycle level. It is most surprising there was no consultation with teachers prior to the announcement of the new arrangements for the examination of children up to the junior certificate level. In what world does that sound like a proper way to deal with major reform, namely, do away with a significant part of the system, refuse to take the ideas of providers of the system on board and then wonder why many are worried about the reform or, indeed, downright opposed to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1208"> On a related matter, I was concerned to read of the Department of Education and Skills plan to develop an individualised database of primary school children, with the inclusion of children's PPS numbers and with this information to be kept until the children reach 30 years of age. Is it truly necessary, I ask, to collect and store this information at all, let alone for such a long period, well beyond school leaving age, including well beyond the average third level age of completion?</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> On another related matter, the announcement by the Minister of the construction of four new schools through public private partnership has also deeply concerned me. This practice, I had thought, lay in the failed policies of the former Fianna Fáil-PD coalition Government. Perhaps I should not be too surprised that the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition has decided to take a leaf out of its book. I understand that building has commenced on four new post-primary schools under schools bundle 4 of the Government's PPP programme. The Minister, Deputy Jan O Sullivan, has said the project was cost-effective, "in so far as we pay over a long period of time" and "also the fact that the maintenance is part of the programme".</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> The hand-over of the provision of schools to private companies is an expensive and cumbersome option. We have seen in the past that PPPs undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills turned out to be up to 19% more expensive than conventional procurement. The schools and sports pitches in this case will be funded by AIB Corporate Banking and German bank KfW IPEX-Bank. What sort of example are we setting our children? Only those truly lacking in insight would fail to see the total inappropriateness of this in an educational setting. This is the first roll out of construction of almost 3,000 new school places. I fear they will all take this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> Iarraim ar an Aire athsmaoineamh a dhéanamh. I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to take the opportunity to sit down with the relevant parties - directly with the teachers - to discuss the best way forward and to adopt a truly reform-based approach to our junior cycle. Let us not throw the baby out with the bath water by jeopardising parts of the education system that can be reformed and retained, the two not being in conflict with each other.</p>

          <p eId="para_1212">Ní bhíonn aon oibrí ag iarraidh dul amach ar ghníomhaíocht thionsclaíoch. Nuair a dheineann oibrí a leithéid, de ghnáth ní bhíonn aon rogha fágtha aige nó aici. De ghnáth, bíonn an próiseas idirbheartaíochta spíonta. Tá cuma ar an scéal seo nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna ag éisteacht le múinteoirí na hÉireann - iad siúd atá i mbun teagaisc dhaltaí na hÉireann. Tá an Rialtas ag tabhairt neamhaird ar thuismitheoirí na hÉireann freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213"> Is léir go bhfuil faitíos ar dhaoine go bhfuil moltaí an Rialtais bunaithe ar chiorruithe siar in ionad ar athchóiriú an chórais. Níl éinne ar an taobh seo den Teach cinnte dearfa de na hargóintí atá déanta ag an Rialtas ar an bpolasaí seo. Conas a chuireann an polasaí seo daltaí i gcroílár an chórais? Conas atá an polasaí seo ar mhaithe le leas na bpáistí? Is léir nach bhfuil an buille buach ag an Rialtas ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo agus ní mór dóibh druidim siar anois chun machnamh géar a dhéanamh. </p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> Bíonn urlabhraí Shinn Féin, an Teachta Jonathan O'Brien, ag plé go tréan i gcónaí leis an Rialtas agus ag iarraidh orthu gan dul ar aghaidh in aghaidh tola na múinteoirí. Ba cheart don Rialtas gan an droch pholasaí seo a chur i bhfeidhm in aghaidh tola múinteoirí atá i mbun teagaisc ár bpáistí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> The position of the ASTI is that while teachers are open to using different modes of junior certificate assessment, they object to the change in the teacher's role from advocate to judge. This seems rational. If we think back to our schooling, would we have been treated better if the teacher had been a judge or advocate? Most of us would come to the same conclusion as the teachers. As educators, teachers are best equipped to advise us on the most advantageous way to teach and the best environment for children. They are also best equipped to explain to us the real implications of the change in the teacher-student relationship dynamic. Unions also have a capacity to provide us with details on the difficulties within the education system. There is a capacity problem within the system, as a result of the major damage caused in recent years at the coal face of the education system due to the austerity policies of the Government. These have, in the main, undermined the quality of the education delivered in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216"> The Minister's proposals cannot be analysed in a vacuum and must be viewed in the context of successive cuts in the primary and secondary sectors year after year for the past six years, even up to the 2015 budget in which the capitation grant was cut. These cuts did not need to be made. What makes the Minister's intransigence on this issue even more frustrating is that she is distracting attention from the significant points of agreement on reform of the junior cycle. The teacher unions were very clear on their commitment to having a first class junior cycle for all students and advocated a move away from dependence on final written examinations to the promotion of different types of assessment, including more practical projects and portfolio work. Rather than working with the education sector to progress an ambitious reform objective, the Minister has chosen to plant herself firmly in the mire of intransigence on the issue of assessment, yet she has failed to cobble together a half decent argument as to why she must take this approach. Surely, the Government's prime objective in implementing reform in the junior cycle is to enhance outcomes for students. This is a key point of agreement between educators and the Minister. On that basis, I appeal to the Minister of State present and the Minister to postpone further implementation of the junior certificate reforms and to return to the negotiating table until she reaches agreement.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1217">I agree with many of those who have spoken tonight. There is no huge disparity between both sides of the House, but there are difficulties in the system. We are in favour of reform. Deputy Joanna Tuffy has suggested there has been a change in Sinn Féin's position, but we have not changed our position. I was spokesperson for Sinn Féin on education before Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and there is continuity in what we have been saying. We believe the system needs change. We also agree, as Deputy John Lyons said, that the idea of a child sitting an examination that might change the direction of their life or education on a day that might be a bad one for him or her needs to be changed. That is wrong. We agree, therefore, with the concept of continuous assessment, but the difficulty lies with where it stops. That is the difficulty for teachers also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218"> The Taoiseach said this morning that the only people who would suffer as a result of the strike tomorrow were pupils. He is wrong, as usual. It will affect not only pupils but also teachers. They will lose out. Parents will also be affected and may have to rearrange their work schedules. The strike will impact on people and teachers are not taking this step lightly. I genuinely believe they want to see the best process for their students. The issue is about the capacity of teachers to do their work. It is also about an examination system that is impartial, fair and standardised. It is about relationships. It is not only about the relationship between teachers and the Minister but about relationships within the classroom. It is about the relationship between the teacher, the pupil and his or her parents. The changes the Minister proposes to force through, against the advice of teachers, are going to change this dynamic hugely. We will have a situation where some students will say: "That teacher never liked me and that is why he gave me a bad mark." We can all imagine that scenario. This will put pressure on teachers, particularly those in a small school or community. The difficulty is not with the concept of continuous assessment. The teachers to whom I have talked and their unions do not have a problem with it. The difficulty concerns the final arbiter and examination of pupils' work. It also concerns the standard to be applied. People want a standard that will apply across the system. The advantage of the current system is that it provides for that standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219"> We all agree that change needs to happen, but we disagree with some of the proposed elements of that change. As was said this morning, the Minister needs to step back and look again at the issue as we need a fresh approach. We all agree that we need to move away from rote learning. This is part of the curriculum for change and we do not have a problem with it. Students' future prospects should not depend on how they respond in one or two particular examinations. We agree that change needs to happen, but it must be managed and agreement must be sought on everything. This is an issue that must be discussed collectively. It is not just about a decision made by the Minister that this is the way forward. She needs to get teachers on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220"> People ask why teachers are going on strike. They believe they are doing it for the benefit of their students. It is not a case of individuals within unions deciding on this approach. It has been voted on by the membership of the teacher unions. The collective view of the teachers, whom we imagine know their pupils and the system better than anyone, is that this is the only way forward. Everybody is on board and agrees that reform and continuous assessment are the right way forward. However, teachers believe the current proposals in regard to the final examination are not in the best interests of their students. They are concerned and not alone in their view that assessment of students by their teachers will undermine and detract from the system. That is why they are going on strike.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">The Minister's proposal will also result in profound change by removing the ability of teachers to advocate on behalf of their students. This is another crucial issue, which has not been addressed by anyone. There are fears that this could result in the status of the certificate varying from school to school. There is common agreement that every student is entitled to a fair, impartial and transparent junior cycle examination system. Is the strike happening because the Minister does not want to be seen to be weak on this issue or does she genuinely believe this is the way forward?</p>
          <p eId="para_1222"> There is still a lack of information about how the new framework will work on the ground. Teachers of English who are now required to implement the framework for junior cycle English specification received just one day of in-service training prior to September 2014. I welcome the fact that the Minister went into negotiations with teachers but there is intransigence and she is not responding to the concerns of teachers. In the days to come, instead of addressing the issue, the teachers will be blamed and painted into a corner as being unreasonable on the matter and that is not the case. Teachers are not doing this for selfish reasons but rather to ensure a high level of educational standards and positive student-teacher-parent relationships are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223"> A strike is pending tomorrow but even at this late stage, there is still potential for change and the Minister needs to go back to the negotiations and talk to the teachers. Teachers are not in a vacuum. They are members of society as well. They have experienced in their own workplaces many of the cuts that have been introduced by the Government. While the strike is about the changes that are being forced on them, it is also about many of the enforced changes that were introduced in the education system. We all accept that the need for the goodwill of teachers is a key component of the system and, unfortunately, that goodwill has been tested repeatedly in recent years. In many cases, teachers are saying they have done enough in the context of extracurricular activity, changes to the system and doing short courses. Many schools are at breaking point and teachers are under huge stress not only in the context of resources but also in the difficulties being experienced in the community that are also reflected in the classroom. They say there is no sense coming from the Department of the difficulties being created in schools and the additional pressures on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224"> Education policy should not be based on cherry-picking. The system needs to change. I ask the Minister to revisit the issue as a matter of urgency and to come at this difficulty even at this late hour with a new and fresh approach to reform. The Minister said last night that Sinn Féin has changed its position on this issue but we have not. We are in favour of reform, as are the teachers and many educationalists., but what the Minister is trying to force through is a step too far for teachers and it undermines the credibility of the system in their view. That is why they will go on strike tomorrow. My worry is the strike may escalate. Regardless of what happens tomorrow, the Minister will still have to go into negotiations with teachers. We cannot support changes to a system that lumps more work on overburdened teachers in schools. The goal is more about cutting departmental expenditure than about enhancing pupil education. The system proposed by the Minister will not work and she needs to wake up to that reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225"> I welcome the fact that many Members have engaged in the debate. There is not a huge gap between what we are saying and what others are saying.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1226">We have been waiting on this debate for years and, therefore, I am delighted the motion is before the House. Everyone recognises the need for reform of the junior cycle. Everyone, including Members on the Opposition benches and members of the teacher unions, has bought into the idea of reform and agrees that reform is good. We welcome aspects of what is proposed by the Department but there are others about which we have concerns. It is unfortunate, however, that we are considering reform of the junior certificate examination against a backdrop of continuing cuts in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227"> Teachers are being asked to implement a reform which the Minister believes will deliver improved educational outcomes against the background of diminishing resources and an increasing student population. She must listen to the teacher unions' professional opinion that the proposal to allow teachers to have the final say on their students' progression is not the best way to teach. Tomorrow thousands of teachers will take to the picket line. This has been building for some time. The teachers have tried to avoid this but they feel they have no option but to strike again and we extend our solidarity to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> Sinn Féin calls on the Minister to postpone the implementation of the proposed reform until all outstanding issues have been resolved. We do so because parents and students place great faith in their teachers and entrust their children to them every day. We value teachers for delivering education to our children and recognise that they are highly professional and have the best interests of our children at heart. When teachers argue that this proposal is not in the interests of our children's education, we must listen to them. While the other issues raised in the talks between teaching unions and departmental officials can be resolved, something needs to give in the stalemate on continuous assessment. We cannot continue with the implementation of junior cycle reform against a backdrop of one-day stoppages by teachers and a refusal by the Department to move further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> Few doubt that reform of the junior cycle is needed so that students at second level receive the best education possible. However, the changes that have been proposed by the Government have been met with dismay by the teachers in delivering that education. They are the experts. We cannot forget this and we must listen to them. Their concerns are not driven by self-centred interest but by virtue that they want their pupils to receive the best education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230"> It can hardly be fair on students or teachers that assessment at junior cycle level is made by the teachers themselves. Surely this will lead to discrepancies in the education system, with results and standards varying from school to school and from teacher to teacher, and it will lead to allegations of favouritism and discrimination. This is not a fair system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> There is also the question of whether schools are adequately resourced to deal with a change of this magnitude to the junior cycle examination system. They are at breaking point and teachers are overstretched and beyond their full capacity. Austerity has meant that many schools have been pushed past the brink and some are unable to cope with the system that is in place, never mind the pressures a new system would likely heap on them. Our party calls on the Minister to revisit the proposed system and to put on hold the introduction of the new system until she has talked to teachers and parents groups and allayed their fears. We in Sinn Féin are not against change. We believe change is needed and we want what is best for students. I am struck by the dilemma this issue raises. I heard one teacher on radio discuss how he and his colleagues could be accused of favouritism, particularly in rural areas. For example, a teacher may golf with a student's father. People socialise together and share the same community together. Most people can relate to the teacher unions' suggestion regarding independent mediation and assessment. The practical difficulties teachers face in implementing continuous assessment need to be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">I hope the issue can be resolved because it is in nobody's interest to have teachers out on strike.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1233">I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this motion relating to the reform of the junior cycle that was tabled by Sinn Féin. I had a chance to listen to most of the comments. There was much decent debate but also some ill-informed debate. It is quite clear that some people do not actually understand the changes we proposed or the great lengths the Minister has gone to since November in changing some of the proposals or making advances to make this easier for everyone to adapt. I am surprised that some people would speak on this without having checked the facts but I suppose that is what one will get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234"> Last night, the Minister set out clearly the Government's position on the rationale for the reform. Much of the talk was about continual and in-house assessment versus a State examination. If one listens to some of the speakers earlier and again last night, one will see that much of the evidence has proved that it is that final examination and the lack of change to the assessment model that has prevented real reform. There is proof of that. It is not just us making it up. That is not what we do over here. It is even referred to in some of Sinn Féin Deputies' own speeches. A lot of research shows that the lack of reform in assessment has delayed real reform to the detriment of our students and their future. </p>
          <p eId="para_1235"> It has been mentioned here by some Members that this is to do with funding. Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the comment that Fianna Fáil wanted to end the junior certificate just to save money. That is not the proposal here. Again, the funding for education is going back up with an extra €60 million in the 2015 budget. The Minister secured the extra money needed for this reform with over €9 million being allocated for it and a commitment that resources that are needed to back this up would be found when teased out and properly discussed. It is not a case of cutting money and Deputy Ó Snodaigh should look at his own pre-budget submission because Sinn Féin at the time forgot to allow for demographics and increased student numbers. Under Sinn Féin's budget, the teacher-pupil ratio in primary schools would have gone up from probably 28 to 30 and up by about half in secondary schools. If Sinn Féin wants to quote resources, it should look at its budget as well. The increase in the budget will provide an extra 1,700 teachers this year as well as SNAs. In the context of the debate, €5 million has been allocated which is a total increase of over €9 million to back up this reform structure so it is not about cutting budgets. Let us park that argument. If Sinn Féin is really genuine, it should park the misinformation and discuss the real issues it is concerned with but it should not throw in stuff. It is not about funding. </p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> I was surprised when Deputy Ó Caoláin said that the Minister has not made any meaningful changes. The Deputy is usually quite a reasonable person. The Minister has come a long way. We have gone from 100% internal assessment to 40%. Deputy Tóibín referred to projects. I know that this 40% will be projects. At least 10% or 15% of the 40% internal assessment will be independently verified so it is not a case of just teachers being able to abuse it either positively or negatively. It will be checked and audited so it is not a case of just throwing it over there. There have been many changes and we want to be very clear about that. </p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> I will go through some of the changes. It will no longer be a school certificate. It will very clearly be a State certificate so that is a change in case Sinn Féin thinks there has been no meaningful change. The State Examinations Commission will issue the State certificate. In addition, the commission will sample significant quantities of students' work to verify the marks awarded. Therefore, no teacher should feel under pressure to give a certain award because they say "no, this is going to be independently checked and verified." Teachers will have to share and compare their marking of students within each school in an internal moderation process so it is not a case of one teacher making all the decisions and doing all the marking. Let us actually talk about the changes that have been proposed. We accept that there was great concern before autumn 2014 but the Minister has come a long way even as close as last week when she spoke to the unions about this and being willing to continue talking. The impression that has been given here is that the door is shut and there will be no more talks. That is not the case at all. If Sinn Féin is genuine about it, it should look at what has already been agreed and then discuss the rest but it should not claim that nothing has changed, nothing is happening or nobody is listening because that is not the case. Most people here are genuine about real reform and want it for the benefit of students because that is what we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238"> Every speaker here has said that the current system does not deliver what students need. If Sinn Féin really believes that, let us genuinely talk about the reforms and the difficulties that are there. The main concern voiced by teachers relates to having to assess their own students. We have come a long way on that. Yet when one talks to teachers, one finds that not all of them really had a full conversation among themselves about that. When one teases it out, they see where it has moved and are wiling to talk more about it. Talks will help this and make a big difference. That is why it is pity there will be a strike tomorrow but so be it. I think talks will continue on this and the Minister is open to that. Hopefully, we will get the change we need because most people want this but there has been a lot of movement. </p>
          <p eId="para_1239"> The junior certificate is not meant to be a forerunner of the leaving certificate. It is meant to be a chance to develop students' skills - skills they will need for a modern environment today that involves an awful lot of technology. There is an opportunity for all sorts of short courses ranging from mental health, coding for IT and local tourism if one is interested in tourism in one's area. History was mentioned earlier. There is a great opportunity here. If a significant historic event took place in one's locality, one can do a course on that. Hopefully, it will encourage students to become more engaged and to stay in education. There is plenty of evidence that students can very often lose interest in second or third year. This is about trying to adapt the system to keep their interest, keep them engaged and give them the skills they will need to do the leaving certificate and go on to higher or further education or a job. It is about giving them the skills and the current system does not do that. </p>

          <p eId="para_1244">Molaim an tairiscint. In his contribution, the Minister spoke a few times about whether Sinn Féin is genuine about it. Let me tell him that Sinn Féin is responsible for steering the education system in the North through the most progressive, deep-rooted and radical reform of education since partition under huge opposition from conservative elements. First under Martin McGuinness, then under Caitríona Ruane and now under John O'Dowd, the positive impact of that reform is evident in the greatly improved and improving proportion of students achieving five GCSEs at grades A* to C. For boys, the increase over ten years has been 24%, while for girls, the increase has been 17%. The education budget has also significantly increased, as have the numbers of school building projects that are underway. Last year, the school budget increased by 20% to £1.1 billion. The Irish medium sector is the fastest growing sector in Northern Ireland with almost 3,000 students in 39 schools. More money has been invested in integrated education under Sinn Féin than at any time. During the Stormont House talks recently, we managed to secure £500 million for education for ten years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1250">That is what is possible when there is a vision, strategy and people with a commitment to make these things happen. That is what is desperately needed in this State and this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> When I raised this issue with the Taoiseach this morning, he acknowledged that teachers are professionals. That means that they are the specialists. They know about the job, career and vocation they have. Is iadsan na saoránaigh a chaith na blianta fada faoi oiliúint chun a bheith ina múinteoirí agus a chaith blianta eile ag cruinnithe taca lucht an chórais oideachais. Yet the Taoiseach and Minister have drawn a line and refused to listen to teachers' genuine concerns about being forced to assess 40% of their students' junior cycle work for certification purposes. Teachers have reiterated that their support for a first-class junior certificate for all students and given their support for a move away from their alliance on final written examinations and the promotion of different types of assessment, including more practical project and portfolio work. </p>
          <p eId="para_1252">I do not understand this because the reforms are broadly progressive in thrust and we support them. Why stop short? Why put these reforms in jeopardy with a demand that the teaching unions sign up to this assessment proposition? That effectively imposes a veto over the negotiations. I am sure the teachers do not want to strike. They know a strike will disrupt almost 330,000 students, 30,000 teachers and the families of both teachers and students. If implemented and properly resourced, the reforms, including proper assessments, could greatly enhance the school curriculum and the learning experience of students. The Minister dismissed the notion of funding and spoke about coming back from cuts.</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">I ask her to refrain from speaking about coming back from cuts given what her Government has imposed on public services. Teachers are not being given the necessary supports in terms of continuous professional development and whole school in-service training. If these supports are not provided, we will be creating the potential for future difficulties. The Minister spoke about the need to listen to stakeholders and warned against any one party having a veto, unless that party is the Government. This has brought about the conditions for the strike which is due to take place tomorrow. Our view is that assessment of student exams should be impartial, external, fair and standardised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> As I noted this morning, the Minister will end up in negotiations again. We want agreement rather than confrontation but Ministers need to be problem solvers. A solution will only be found if the Minister goes into a partnership with the teaching profession, as opposed to digging holes and refusing to engage meaningfully. Given that talks will probably resume this Friday or next Monday, why not begin them now? She needs to make a real effort to sort this out so that the teachers can go back to doing what they do best, that is, teaching our children.</p>

          <p eId="para_1256">On behalf of Sinn Féin I thank everyone who contributed to this debate, from both sides of the House. Some of the contributions were very well made and raised issues on which we should reflect. The Minister in her contribution quoted from comments I made in this Chamber in November 2012 on the issue of junior cycle reform. She selectively quoted from my contribution to suggest my party is backtracking on our welcome of the proposals announced by the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. Nothing could be further from the truth. I double checked the Official Report for my comments, and reread the press release we issued on foot of the announcement by the former Minister. I will pass this documentation on to the Minister's office to make it clear that we have not changed our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257"> One of the issues we flagged in the press release was internal assessment by teachers. We stated that it was a stumbling block which needed to be addressed. We have not changed our position on junior cycle reform by one iota. We have welcomed it from day one, just as we welcome the measures on the development of short courses, statements of learning, the establishment of priority learning units, more emphasis on group, portfolio and project work and the movement away from terminal examinations and rote learning towards continuous assessment. There is no difference between what the Minister is proposing and what we believe. I even checked some of our Ard-Fheis motions. Moving away from terminal examinations is a long-standing party policy. We do not agree with the pressures created by a terminal exam, whereby students undergo three years of post-primary education before being judged on their performance in exams which last two weeks. However, we differ from the Minister on her proposal for internal assessment as opposed to external assessment. The Minister of State, Deputy English, stated this is a question of in-house assessment versus a terminal exam. I argue this comes down to in-house assessment versus external accreditation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> The Minister and other Deputies paid tribute to the teaching profession. Even the Taoiseach stated during Leaders' Questions that teachers are highly professional people who should be trusted. I could not agree more. The problem, however, is that while the Minister is patting teachers on the back for their professionalism, she does not trust their word.</p>

          <p eId="para_1260">She does not trust their word. The very people who she entrusts to educate our students are advising her, based on their educational expertise, that it is not in the best interest of students or educational outcomes to introduce a system whereby teachers assess their own students. This opinion is based on the expertise they have gained from doing their jobs over many years. The Minister suggests that the aim of these reforms is to move to a model of continuous assessment because, as she has indicated in replies to parliamentary questions, all of the research indicates that continuous assessment is preferable to terminal exams. If she truly believed that, she would embrace what the teachers are saying. They have repeatedly indicated their willingness to explore models of continuous assessment. They will buy into such a system but they will not accept a system of continuous assessment which requires them to be judge and jury of their own students. If the research indicates that educational outcomes can be improved by a system of continuous assessment, why not embrace that? Why is the Minister determined to introduce a system that places the onus on teachers to correct their own students' work?</p>

          <p eId="para_1262">We are discussing two educational principles. The Minister is trying to describe assessment for learning, whereby teachers engage with their students on a continuous basis and offer feedback. It is not simply about rote learning and a final examination. I agree that we should move towards a system based on assessment for learning. However, by placing the onus on teachers to mark their own examinations, the teacher is introducing a system of assessment of learning.</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">There is a big difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">I appeal to the Minister, even at this very late stage, to postpone the introduction of junior cycle reform, engage constructively with the unions and remove the veto she has placed on negotiations by saying they must accept that 40% of work will be internally assessed. Let us move to a model of continuous assessment, but keep the external accreditation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1663">The Government agreed in December 2011 to address the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling of September 2011 which found that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under the EU non-life Directives by exempting VHI from being regulated (i.e. holding authorisation) by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).

            <p eId="para_1666">39. <b>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</b> asked the <b>Minister for Health</b> the treatment that is available in the State in respect of a person who is diagnosed with Lyme disease; the tests conducted to establish such a diagnosis; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [2330/15]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_411">
            <from>Minister for Health<recordedTime time="2015-01-21T23:03:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1667">Lyme Disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borella burgdorferi. It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called erythema migrans that is seen in about 80-90% of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668"> Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by a medical history and physical examination and can be difficult if there has been no erythema migrans rash. The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to B. burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection. These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease. The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step. Screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever. In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. Samples giving reactive or equivocal tests in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests. Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity. Using this outlined two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease. Testing for Lyme borelliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669"> There is an ongoing publicity campaign regarding Lyme Disease. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is establishing a Lyme Borelliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme borelliosis in Ireland. This will involve raising awareness among clinicians and the general public. It will explore ways to ensure these messages are brought to the general public with the frequency and in forms in which they can be most effective. </p>
            <p eId="para_1670"> Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising regarding prevention and treatment of Lyme Disease, the HPSC holds a Lyme Disease Awareness Week in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages. As part of last year's Awareness Week, a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a "Tickborn Disease Toolkit", developed by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). This toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website. Indeed, the ECDC informed the HPSC that Ireland was the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material. Following the Awareness Week, a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted. </p>

            <p eId="para_1672">As the Deputy is aware, the Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill. These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy</i>, 2012. The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products. Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and I hope to publish a General Scheme of a Bill early this year.</p>

Naas General Hospital has approval to appoint 27 staff nurses and is currently in the process of appointing 10 temporary nurses. Interviews are being held next week to fill the remaining 17 posts on a temporary basis pending the permanent appointment of these posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677"> Any future investment at Naas General Hospital must be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme, within the overall capital envelope available to the health service and in the context of the establishment of hospital groups. In 2015, there will be a structured integration of the Naas General Hospital into the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and this will provide further support for Naas General Hospital in delivering high-quality, safe patient care in a cost-effective manner. </p>

            <p eId="para_1683">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term residential nursing home care. Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. To manage the available funds throughout the year, the HSE operates a national placement list in order of when the applications are approved, and funding is released in strict chronological order as it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684"> As of 5 January 2015 (the latest figures available) there are 1,188 people on this placement list. The current wait time for funding is approximately 11 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685"> The budget for the Scheme in 2015 is €948.8m which reflects an increase of €10m from the 2014 position. The additional €10m was allocated to the Scheme as part of a wider initiative to alleviate the problem of delayed discharges in acute hospitals and has resulted in 300 extra approvals under the Scheme to date. In total since December 2014 funding has been released to provide for 1,200 places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686"> Further to this in July of 2014, the HSE allocated €5m for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people. To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme national placement list.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687"> Since the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in October 2009, 56,989 applications for funding under the Scheme have been received. In 2014, 22,061 people were funded under the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688"> The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme which is currently in progress will include consideration of the balance between community and residential services as well as the future financing and sustainability of the Scheme. Work on this Review is well advanced and will be completed in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1690">I welcome this opportunity to outline the progress being made by the HSE in relation to this very serious matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691"> Like others, I was shocked and distressed by the revelations of extremely poor and unacceptable standards of care and mistreatment of vulnerable adults in Áras Attracta. Every person who uses our disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care. </p>
            <p eId="para_1692"> The safeguarding and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the health service is of paramount importance and the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff instructing them to take personal responsibility for ensuring that individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693"> In December 2014 the HSE initiated both an expert investigation chaired by Mr Christy Lynch, and an independently chaired review of services at this facility led by Dr Kevin McCoy. </p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Mr Lynch’s investigation team is working independently of the HSE and will form an important input into any disciplinary process which the HSE will undertake .</p>
            <p eId="para_1695"> Dr McCoy is undertaking an Assurance Review of the services at Áras Attracta and the final report will include an individual plan for improvement in each bungalow within the complex. The review will identify system wide learning involving engagement with relevant expertise as well as input from staff. </p>
            <p eId="para_1696"> I welcome the fact that the Gardaí have now cleared the way so that Mr. Lynch’s investigation can commence. I have asked the HSE to keep me informed of progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697"> The HSE has undertaken a number of additional initiatives to ensure that quality and safe care in residential services for people with disabilities is appropriately implemented and monitored. </p>
            <p eId="para_1698"> A six-step plan will address this in a systematic way. These steps are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1699"> - The establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce, including a series of National Summits to improve client safety, dignity, respect and culture;</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">- Implementation of the <i>National Policy &amp; Procedures on Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse</i>;</p>
            <p eId="para_1701"> - Development of an Advocacy programme;</p>
            <p eId="para_1702"> - Implementation of an evaluation and quality improvement programme in disability residential centres;</p>
            <p eId="para_1703"> - Development of an implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the McCoy review of residential services in Áras Attracta when complete, and,</p>
            <p eId="para_1704"> - Development of long term sustainable &amp; evidence-based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705"> The HSE is considering plans to monitor practices in social care facilities through the use of surveillance cameras, undercover persons and/or other means. However, it is very conscious of potential difficulties that could arise in relation to privacy and data protection, and given the complex issues involved, has decided to engage expert consultants to advise it on the best way to proceed. A Prior Information Notice under EU procurement rules was published in mid-December in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706"> I can assure the Deputy that my Department will monitor progress on the initiatives and processes commissioned by the HSE in relation to Áras Attracta, to ensure that the learning from this incident is promulgated throughout our health system.</p>
