          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">This morning, the Minister for Finance revealed that we are living beyond our means despite the fact that, some weeks ago, he stated that this was the way in which people wanted us to go.  We have been led into the middle of an economic swamp by the most disastrous Government of the past 40 years.  Confidence in the economy has fallen and there is no strategy or plan to get us out of this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Just six weeks ago, the Government set out a projected borrowing in 2009 of €13.4 billion.  Given yesterday's figures on Exchequer returns to the end of November, the projection will be out by at least €5 billion, meaning a possible borrowing of up to €20 billion.  This morning, the Minister for Finance stated that only a certain amount of taxation can be levied and that he does not expect further tax increases in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The Government has established another subcontractor to make recommendations on how to rein in public spending.  If there are to be no further tax increases in 2009, does the Government intend to rectify the economy by cutting public spending by €5 billion and revisiting the national pay deal?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">The measures we took this year in terms of expenditure mean our expenditure plans will come in broadly on target.  The problem that has arisen relates to the serious decline in tax revenue across nearly all tax heads, a reduction in the order of 13% this year.  This will have an impact on our opening position next year also.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Our strategy involves a collective effort by all stakeholders, including the social partners.  Regarding the framework of the pay agreement, its operation is continually discussed in partnership.  However, it is important to point out that continuing with our strategy of investing in public programmes, an investment that amounts to twice the European average, proceeding with public sector reform and using the people appointed by the Minister for Finance to examine other expenditure programmes and public service numbers are all part of a strategy to bring our public finances under control.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It is a serious situation, which we have indicated by bringing forward an early budget.  Since then, there has been a further deterioration in our public finances.  In an interview this morning, the Minister for Finance outlined how, given the relatively weak revenues accruing, he will not seek to raise tax revenue next year in addition to the budgetary arrangements already made.  In a credible timeframe, we must consider how to bring the current budget deficit under control while continuing with the capital investment programme.  Had the Government decided against the strategy of continuing record capital investment, the figures would be quite different.  We are not prepared to postpone building capacity in the economy because it is part of our strategy to be ready for the upturn in the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">The Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance for three years prior to assuming his current office.  He saw the warning signs and knew that, given information received from the housing industry, spending programmes would lead to this situation, yet he ignored those warnings.  Jobs are being lost at a rate of 10,000 per month and, despite the fact that 2 million people are at work, consumer spending is not confident.  The Government exacerbated the situation by imposing a VAT increase.  This has devastated a swathe of countryside 50 miles south of the Border because the British Government has gone the other way and reduced its VAT rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">There is no plan.  The Government should inform the House as to whether it intends to go back to the drawing board to examine the fundamentals of the budget's structure.  If the Minister for Finance will not introduce a mini-budget in the spring or increase taxes in 2009 on top of the 17 imposed in the budget six weeks ago, the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, must inform the House as to whether the Government will propose a reduction in public expenditure of €5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have provided three alternatives.  The Government should reconsider whether to reduce investment in the capital programme by almost €1 billion.  Infrastructure is critical.  The VAT increase is devastating thousands of retailers within 50 miles of the Border.  In light of the Minister for Finance's comments on the national pay deal this morning and given the way in which it was negotiated and the current financial circumstances, does the Taoiseach intend to revisit it and plough savings from it into public infrastructure, retraining, upskilling and the protection of jobs?</p>

          <p eId="para_63">The Minister for Finance then introduced a budget, the figures relating to which were wrong.  Last week we were informed that an announcement would be made in respect of an economic strategy but the Taoiseach has now stated that such a strategy is already in place.  The only difficulty in that regard is that the rest of us do not know the nature of that strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">We were informed yesterday that the Government's revenue from tax will be €2 billion less than it calculated only seven weeks ago in the budget.  The Minister for Finance indicated on radio this morning that there will not be a mini-budget and that taxes will not be increased.  I presume, therefore, that the shortfall in the tax take will be balanced by the introduction of cuts in expenditure.  In the budget, the Government set down its intention to save €2 billion and we are aware of the consequences to which this will give rise for pensioners, the unemployed, class sizes etc.  Obviously, it is now contemplating making savings of a further €2 billion.  The only problem is that the Minister for Finance has now indicated his intention to wait until the figures for December emerge in order that the Government will be in a better position to judge what it is going to do at the end of the year.  It is a case of live horse and you will get grass.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">When will the Taoiseach publish a strategy — written in plain language and easily understandable — that will outline the direction in which the economy is going and the leadership the Government intends to provide in respect of this matter?  He might also indicate what are the November unemployment figures, which are due to be published in 15 minutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">I am not seeking to attack the Opposition.  I am defending myself from attacks by the Opposition, which I am entitled to do.  Those opposite are entitled to attack me and I am entitled to defend myself and the position of the Government in respect of its policies.  That is fair enough.  Let us keep it simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">We have a strategy in place.  In order to ensure that spending would remain within the parameters set down, we introduced changes in July.  This happened when the figures for June indicated that spending estimates would be off by €3 billion.  The changes to which I refer will have the effect of ensuring that expenditure for this year will be brought in on line with the parameters set down.  We made a decision with regard to what we would spend this year and adhered to it.  However, the Opposition opposed that decision and the changes to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The second step in our strategy was to bring the budget forward to October.  The purpose behind this was to being to the attention of the public the fact that our situation was deteriorating sharply.  In his Budget Statement the Minister indicated our estimates for taxes and spending for 2009 but also stated that we would continue to respond as the situation developed.  That is what we will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The position internationally is deteriorating.  Ireland is a casualty in this regard as a result of the open nature of its economy.  We are responding to these changing circumstances.  As already stated, our first action is to control spending for this year and next year.  There will be a significant decrease in the rate of increase in expenditure next year.  We have introduced cuts in respect of all Departments with the exception of the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs.  Despite the fact that they claim they want order brought to the public finances, those in Opposition opposed all of the economies and cutbacks we have made or introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">We are also determined to boost the economy.  I have already explained that because we have a national development plan and are implementing it, the boost to which I refer is being taken for granted.  In previous years we could pay for the capital investment programme relating to the national development plan from our surplus reserves.  However, we are now in a position where we will be obliged to borrow in order to fund that programme.  I have no difficulty borrowing for capital purposes.  This is the correct thing to do in current circumstances in order that we can make the economy more competitive and when the upturn comes, we will be in a position to return to a period of growth as soon as possible.  Strategically, this is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The simplest way to remain within our budgets and avoid all the difficult decisions that must be made in respect of current spending would be to suspend the capital investment programme and then I would have no difficulty showing Deputies that the budget is well within the Stability and Growth Pact guidelines.  We are not prepared to suspend the capital investment programme because it is vital that it should remain in place.  Deputy Kenny suggested that we have cut it out of sight.  That is not the case.  It has only been cut by approximately 10%.</p>

The amount to be spent on it would only be increased by €800 million if the economy was growing by a far greater rate.  This is a strong commitment by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Before we made our decisions, there were calls that we should prioritise our spending.  The National Development Plan 2006-2013, which is predicated on annual growth in the economy of 4%, will not be implemented within that timeframe.  However, we should continue with its implementation, even if over a longer timeframe, because it is the right thing to do for this country.</p>

We must, to the greatest extent we can, bring about a competitive position for our economy in the context of the resources available to us.  This means we must continue with a public investment programme of the size of which I have spoken, namely, up to 5.5% of GNP in a recession — far in excess of what was contemplated by previous Administrations during boom times — as a percentage of what we are producing.  The difficulty that will arise in this regard — we must be clear about this — is that we will need to make further economies on the current side.  There is no way around that.</p>

We swiftly introduced a banking guarantee which meant we did not have the calamitous situation of a collapse in our banking system.  We continue to strive to ensure we have an appropriate banking system and we are determined, if there is State investment in the sector, that the taxpayer will get a good deal and liquidity will flow to business.  We are asking the private sector to make its contribution in this respect also.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">It was suggested some weeks ago that we should go on behalf of the taxpayer and borrow in full for such a recapitalisation, not as a last resort but as a first option.  We must take into account the demands on current and future taxpayers in terms of borrowing.  It is only fair to say, as I have indicated already, that the Government and I are in the process of bringing forward further ideas, strategies, options and initiatives that will accentuate the positive in respect of our economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">We can all add; this is not complicated.  There is less tax revenue coming in to the State.  We heard the figures in this regard yesterday.  The Minister for Finance says there will be no new budget and no additional taxes.  There will, therefore, be what the Taoiseach calls "economies" or "adjustments", which basically amount to cuts in expenditure.   I want to know how this will be achieved.  Will the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance come before the House at some stage and tell us what is the plan in this regard or will they allow the next couple of weeks to run ahead and then, during the Christmas and New Year period, allow individual Ministers and the Minister for Finance to do this by way of departmental decision without any presentation in this House of what is being done?</p>

We have never suggested that budgetary stability on its own is a comprehensive response.  As I indicated, we are maintaining, at a time of recession, our capital investment programme to the tune of €8.2 billion in respect of direct Exchequer spend.  An additional PPP provision of €800 million will bring us to a spend of €9 billion next year.

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_141">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">These questions relate to the findings of the Quigley report, which was published in 2005.  That report highlighted the need for special care in cases where a proposed consultancy comprises an element of direct service to a Minister or Minister of State, particularly in the public relations or communications area, and-or where a Minister or a Minister of State suggests the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">As I outlined to the House previously, following publication of the Quigley report, additional procurement guidelines were approved by the Government and are published on my Department's website.  The guidelines were brought to the attention of all Secretaries General, who were asked to implement them and to bring them in future to the attention of all newly-appointed Ministers, and Ministers of State where relevant, in their Department or office.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The guidelines give the Secretary General to the Government and the Government secretariat a role in examining certain procurements.  I should say, however, that there is no special committee in my Department to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts by Ministers.  Any workload arising from the application of these additional procedures is handled within existing resources in the Government secretariat.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">The restrictions on consultancies and public relations announced last July were aimed at reducing expenditure by Departments and they have no impact on the procurement procedures which must be followed by Departments.  The question of issuing new guidelines in relation to the additional procedures prescribed following the Quigley report does not, therefore, arise.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_146">Are any measures in place to evaluate the impact of public relations campaigns, advertising and consultancies awarded by Government?  For instance, in June 2007 the National Centre for Partnership and Performance launched a major public awareness campaign which involved advertising through coverage on television, radio, Internet, outdoor, press and public relations.  The campaign represented an unprecedented opportunity to raise public awareness about the national workplace strategy.  Does the Taoiseach know the extent of the cost of that campaign?  What sort of impact analysis was carried out following that programme?</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Last week it came to light that 93% of the expenditure of €866,000 by FÁS on its 2005 science challenge, was spent on advertising, PR and promotional communications.  Was that matter referred to Government in respect of the extent of expenditure for covering advertising and promotional communications?  Is the Taoiseach happy with the apparent sole control of this being vested in one person?  In other words, if we spend 93% of a budget of €866,000 on a science challenge, which is an important element of Government strategy and considered to be important in the light of young people getting involved in this area, who approves that funding?</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Does the Taoiseach consider the recommendations of the Quigley report, produced in 2005, are important, including the recommendation which states that the Department of Finance should also consider giving advice on the monitoring and recording of work done under these contracts and their quality?  Does that occur and did it occur in the case of the expenditure on the science challenge by FÁS?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_149">In regard to what progress has been made in implementing the remainder of the recommendations contained in the Quigley report, the first point to make is that by immediately drawing up and issuing the additional guidelines, all recommendations relevant to my Department were implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">In regard to recommendations addressed to other Departments, I understand the position to be as follows.  A Department of Finance subgroup, consisting of representatives from the Department of Finance and the Government's contracts committee, carried out a review in accordance with the recommendations of the Quigley report regarding the engagement of consultants guidelines, consolidating various elements of previous guidelines and augmenting them, where appropriate.  These were prepared, subsequently published and circulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government procurement guidelines and practices in that Department were reviewed and a set of consolidated guidelines were made available to all staff.  Revised procedures were put in place to strengthen monitoring and control of procurement and intensive briefing and refresher training was arranged for all staff engaged in procurement.  Reference material on procurement was also published on the Department's Internet website which made it readily available to all staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The OPW procurement procedures were reviewed within Dublin Castle and conference facility and public procurement best practice is applied to all procurement requirements.  Within the broader OPW, a working group was established to review the procurement policies and procedures and make recommendations as to necessary changes.  The report contained revised procurement guidelines for all OPW staff.  They were embraced in best practice and ensure that the 2004 Department of Finance public procurement guidelines competitive process is fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">Regarding the Deputy's question, the only matters brought to my attention if a Department proposes to engage PR consultants to advise it on issues, is where the Department proposes to engage such consultants — that fact has to be brought to my attention — where there is an element of direct service to a Minister, particularly a PR communications area, and the Minister has suggested the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  If these criteria are not applicable, then there is no need for my approval or for their referral to the Government secretariat.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">Regarding PR budgets within agencies, that is a matter for senior management, as these are operational matters within individual agencies.  The guidelines that apply to public bodies are expected to be adhered to and the audit committee and others are the control mechanisms by which that is scrutinised.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_117">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_155">Following on the Taoiseach's reply, it is important that the work of State Departments and Ministers, in following through on implementing Government policy be made known to people and be made public in order that people can understand what the Government is about or supposed to be about.  From that point of view, does the Taoiseach consider it is necessary for every Minister to have his or her own public relations contract, in other words, to promote the Minister individually or the Minister and Ministers of State?  There is an army of press officers throughout the entire Government sector and each Department has its own press officer and so on who have, I assume, a duty and responsibility to spell out the work of the Department and, therefore, the work of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">If the Taoiseach is talking about cutbacks in current spending, would he consider the question of every Minister in the Government having his or her own public relations contract separate from the press work of the Department he or she heads?  Perhaps it might be considered appropriate, under the Taoiseach's Department or whatever, to have a Government relations agency, such as the Government press and information section, which should be able to deal with the promotion of the work of all the Taoiseach's Ministers and which, I am sure, would implement a considerable saving as opposed to individual public relations contracts being allocated to each Minister.  Is this a proposal the Taoiseach might examine in the context of getting out the same message but at a considerable saving?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_119">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_158">As part of our savings, we introduced a 50% cut across all these areas.  The point here is that many offices serve Departments and Ministers in respect of dealing with the media and public affairs, etc., who are themselves career civil servants; not all of them are brought in but some are and it is a matter of preference for Ministers who may have built up a relationship with people in this area over a period of time and who particularly suit their way of working.  The general point to be made, however, is that this area, like every other, must be watched very closely to ensure that the benefits one would expect for the resources applied emanate and that it is run in a proper and professional way.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">Regarding the idea of establishing an omnibus Government relations agency, for many Departments a certain expertise and acquaintance with the issues of the day is required.  For example, the Department of Finance would be very different in terms of the needs of media and others compared to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism or another Department.  In many cases, there are people who are of the Department who work either in a primary position or in supplementary positions around the person engaged as a press officer for that purpose and without whom the efficiency and efficacy of the office would be compromised.  Taking account of all that, in terms of achieving savings, would one get the service required?  It could be argued that we would not.  There are some specialist areas that require a specialist knowledge and an ability to come back with information quickly to people.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_160">I wish to pursue two aspects of the Quigley report with the Taoiseach.  One of the recommendations of the report was that approval by the Taoiseach would be required where a Minister was taking on either an individual or a PR consultancy firm providing advice to the Minister.  Was that practice ever adopted and on how many occasions, if any, has his approval been sought for the appointment of such a person?</p>
            <p eId="para_161">A procedure was recommended by the Quigley report that where a Minister was nominating an individual or a PR firm to be appointed, it would be notified to the Secretary General of the Government.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House on how many occasions that practice has been complied with since 2005?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_121">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_162">In regard to how many cases referred to the Government Secretariat under the procedure have received the Taoiseach's approval, seven cases coming within the terms of the guidelines have been processed so far.  In September of this year, I agreed to the appointment of a consultant by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to conduct a facilitation exercise in connection with the consultation paper on next generation broadband.  In 2007, one case was noted by my predecessor following consideration by the Secretary General to the Government of an invitation to tender for consultancy work at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to scope out a project to lead to the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  I understand the candidate concerned was not subsequently successful in the tender competition.  Two cases related to the appointment of an arts adviser to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  My predecessor approved one of those appointments in 2005 following appropriate prior consideration by the Secretary General to the Government.  Upon the resignation of the original post holder, my predecessor approved the appointment of a successor to the post in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">The three other cases referred to the Secretary General to the Government were, on consideration by him, found not to fall within the scope of the guidelines and so did not require consideration or approval.  They related to the appointment of IT, PR and communications consultants, respectively.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_164">Perhaps the Taoiseach would advise us in respect of the three which did come within the remit of the guidelines?  Can he tell us what was the value or the cost of the contract in each case?</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_166">How is it decided whether PR work to be undertaken is to be given to the various press offices within each Department, the Government's own press department or to go to outside contract?  Has the committee in question examined the criteria used to make that call in the first instance?  If not, will there be an examination of the criteria?  Is it the practice of the committee to vet proposals by Ministers for PR work to be contracted out?  Does the committee vet the Minister's decision?</p>
            <p eId="para_167">Have there been any further restrictions on PR contracts since the Government's announcement of cutbacks in July?  The Taoiseach referred to cutbacks of 50%.  Will he clarify whether there has been a 50% cutback in PR operations?  Does the Taoiseach refer to PR contracts or the in-house department?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_125">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_168">We have asked for 50% reductions in PR contracts as part of our savings in the July initiative.  That has been carried out.  On the question of how it is decided whether to use somebody in-house or to get somebody from outside, it is a matter in many instances for the Minister.  Under the guidelines Ministers have an entitlement to bring two or three advisers with him or her to a Department to help advise them on matters of policy, communications or whatever.  That is the process whereby a Minister applies to the Minister for Finance for approval of the appointment of such a person within various income guidelines that are outlined.  There is a procedure that enables one to decide.  The appointment must come within a Minister's complement of staff.  Sometimes Ministers do not make appointments for that purpose; they might have two policy advisers rather than one policy adviser and one person looking after press matters.  It is a question of ministerial choice.</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_169">Does the committee vet a Minister's decision?  I am not clear on that element of the matter.  If a Minister wishes to bring in outside contractors for PR purposes, must he or she get the approval of the committee?  If that is the case, what criteria are involved in the committee's decision?</p>

            <p eId="para_170">A committee is not involved; the Minister for Finance is involved in the approval process.  Arising out of an initiative that arose some years ago, the Quigley report indicated, where a Department proposed to engage consultants, that fact must be brought to the attention of the Taoiseach where there is an element of direct service to a Minister, especially in the PR-communications area, or if the Minister has suggested the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  Where a Minister indicates he or she would like to have person X to carry out services directly for him or her, that issue would have to be brought to the attention of the Taoiseach, in addition to the approval requirement of the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_129">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_177">In the White Paper on regulatory reform, there is a list of actions relating to the legislative process.  I raised with the Taoiseach's predecessor on many occasions the requirement to have prior sight of the heads of a Bill by Members of these Houses.  The Taoiseach's predecessor gave repeated commitments that, where at all possible, he would take a proactive position in encouraging Ministers in the various Departments to respond positively to my and other Deputies' requests in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">Does the Taoiseach accept that it can often be a difficult and challenging period for Opposition Deputies between sight of legislation and when they must respond in the House because often very little time is provided for that?  In terms of improving the engagement and contribution of Opposition Members, does the Taoiseach accept that the publication of the heads of a Bill in advance, giving a sense of the content, focus and address of the legislation, would be of huge benefit and would significantly contribute to an improved quality of discussion on the floor of the House?</p>
            <p eId="para_179">What steps has the Taoiseach taken to endeavour to build on the stated position of the former Taoiseach?  Does he accept there has been little evidence of any co-operation with the former Taoiseach's stated view on the matter?  Does he also accept that in most cases we do not have sight of the heads of the Bills and that the stated intent of the former Taoiseach has not been met by the actions of the various Ministers and Departments?</p>
            <p eId="para_180">I am sorry the Ceann Comhairle is absent for my next point.  I beg the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to record my welcome of recent correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle signalling the advent of preparatory committees in both the Houses of the Oireachtas and, correspondingly, in the Assembly in Belfast working towards the all-Ireland interparliamentary forum.  I welcome that development.  Could the Taoiseach indicate whether legislation is required for the establishment of the all-Ireland interparliamentary forum and the all-Ireland civic forum, both of which are promised entities under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_130">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_181">On the second part of the Deputy's question, I do not believe legislation will be required.  I am not sure that a statutory basis should be provided when establishing a forum but obviously the preparatory committees in both the Oireachtas and the Assembly in Northern Ireland can consider the means by which it can be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">I welcome the establishment, at the earliest possible opportunity, of the civic forum and the interparliamentary forum.  They will be very important given recent welcome developments in terms of consolidating the political work envisaged under the respective agreements.  This work is such that we can propose common solutions to common problems as they arise and make use of parliamentary interaction that I, as one of the original members of the British-Irish parliamentary forum, regarded as very important.  It was a very important, behind-the-scenes, under the radar forum where we got to know people a lot better and in respect of which far better understanding developed regarding British-Irish affairs generally.  I would very much welcome the establishment of the fora as soon as possible.  I wish well the preparatory committees that are working on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">On the question on heads of Bills, I will check where commitments were given by the former Taoiseach in this regard.  Perhaps Deputy Ó Caoláin might refer to previous parliamentary debates, if he can recall them, in which the former Taoiseach had something to say about this matter.  There probably should be room for more discussion and for making much better use of our committee system in this respect.  The Deputy made the point that there is sometimes very little time in which Government or Opposition Deputies can make a contribution between the publication of a Bill and its consideration on the floor of the House, and sometimes its speedy enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">On the Order of Business, Members often complain about the delay in bringing Bills forward for publication.  There is, therefore, considerable time between the announcement of impending legislation and its subsequent publication in which Deputies can inquire into the state of play regarding that legislation.  They can do so through correspondence, the use of the committee system when the Minister is before a committee, or during Question Time or the Adjournment.  There are other means by which information can be gleaned under the Standing Orders of the House rather than by doing so on the Order of Business, which I believe is sometimes over-utilised for this purpose.  While there may be a short timeframe between the publication and enactment of a Bill, there is usually a very long timeframe between its announcement and publication, thus enabling Deputies to acquaint themselves with the progress being made during the drafting process.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The provision of heads of Bills would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis.  With regard to certain legislation, the publication of the heads might prejudice certain people in the sector in question by giving them prior knowledge or a competitive advantage, although what they find out at that stage might not reflect the full, comprehensive thinking of the Government on the specific issue in question.  The heads of a Bill might indicate the general areas that are being considered but the legal phraseology in the sections of the Bill might have a far greater or lesser impact, depending on the intent of the Minister.  Therefore, the heads of the Bill do not often give one an accurate read although I take the point they would give one an overall orientation regarding the intent of the Government or relevant Department regarding legislation as it is being developed.  As a Member of this House, I agree and have always believed that we must encourage fuller participation of all Members of the House in respect of all work in the House, including the legislative work.  The committee system, used well, effectively and in a co-ordinated way, affords an excellent opportunity to Members to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">I accept the point that unless legislation is taken in plenary session, the difficulty that arises in trying to seek public attention for what one has to say is not proportionate to the effort many Deputies on all sides make in trying to enact legislation that would be effective on its signature by the President.  I am generally very supportive of any means by which we can assist Deputies to acquaint themselves with legislation and make a full contribution thereon.  I acknowledge that this objective often falls short of being met in practice in that, when Bills are published, they sometimes require rather speedy enactment because of difficulties that arise or because of the requirement to plug a loophole immediately.  I am not opposed to what has been said but each Bill must be considered on a case-by-case basis.  I hear what the Deputy is saying.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">With regard to the time factor, does the Taoiseach accept that, while Deputies endeavour to inform themselves of the intent and thrust of legislation, the provision of its heads would represent a significant improvement over the current practice whereby a very poor opportunity is presented to them on the Order of Business to ask questions on promised legislation?  The Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, by virtue of a Standing Order, restrict us to very particular lines of questioning in respect of potential, possible or signalled dates of publication.  Does the Taoiseach accept that I am reflecting a view I believe is held by Deputies of all parties, that is, that the heads of a Bill would be of major assistance?  Will he confirm that he will check the commitments made by the former Taoiseach?  They were made on the floor of this Chamber on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">With regard to a matter very much in evidence in the course of Leaders' Questions this morning, does the Taoiseach envisage legislation from his Department arising from the work of the task force on the public service?</p>

            <p eId="para_189">The report of the task force on the public service identified a range of actions that will require enabling statutory provision.  It is likely, however, that as the report's recommendations are implemented, the case for further legislative provision will arise.  The forthcoming White Paper on local government will also necessitate new legislation, which may provide an opportune vehicle for some of the changes proposed by the task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">The actions include an obligation on Departments to review the mandates of State bodies at five-year intervals; changes in the reporting requirements of State agencies; the reorganisation, merger or abolition of State agencies; the removal of barriers to staff mobility and redeployment; the reinforcement, if necessary, of the county level, or groups of counties, as the basis for planning and service delivery; to enhance the powers of local government and other bodies to lead, co-ordinate or deliver services on behalf of other agencies; the possible formal delegation of financial and other responsibilities to public service managers — this would include the delegation of financial authority, responsibility and associated accountability to the lowest feasible level; and the requirement to produce an annual report on the state of the public service.  The implementation phase, as the Deputy knows, commences immediately and will be overseen by a Cabinet committee, chaired by me, which will be considering the legislative provisions required in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_191">Can the Taoiseach explain why his Ministers are so bad and so slow at producing legislation?  The current legislative programme lists 19 Bills that are supposed to be published this session, but only six have been published to date.  I examined the list of promised legislation published in May 2003.  A minerals development Bill was supposed to appear in 2004 and we are now told it will not appear until mid-2009.  A national monuments Bill was supposed to appear in late 2003 and we are now told it is not possible to say when it will appear.  A nurses and midwives Bill, a judicial council Bill, a Curragh of Kildare Bill and a landlord and tenant Bill were supposed to appear in 2004, but none of these has appeared.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">The Taoiseach appointed additional Ministers of State.  What are they doing and why are they not producing the legislation that they and the Government promised would appear four years ago?  Are their travel commitments so exhausting that they are suffering from jet lag and cannot prepare the legislation when they return home?  What is the problem?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_203">I am more resilient that he thinks.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">The legislative priorities for the Government in the current session are as per the A list which was published in September 2008.  Five of those Bills have been published and a further three that were not on the list were published.  We will review the priorities for the next session in the normal course and a new list will be published in January.  The focus from now to 2012 must be in implementing the programme for Government as resources allow.  A number of consolidation and restatement projects are continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">On a general level, I take the point made by the Deputy.  Legislative priorities change according as needs arise.  I cannot explain each on a personal basis and it is beyond the remit of the question.  However, I am sure that if one were to put down questions for Ministers one might glean why the journey for any particular legislation is so long and meandering.  In many respects, the reason is that Ministers and Government and Opposition parties have identified other priorities beyond those mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">There is also the fact that drafting legislation is a highly specialised craft.  This bedevils consecutive Governments and I know the matter has been worked on by Governments anxious to improve performance in this area.  The training and upskilling of people from within the system requires continuing effort.  As Deputies know, there are many people who have retired from the service and that without their continuing effort beyond retirement we would be left in a very difficult situation regarding some of these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">However, it is a point.  I can ask the Chief Whip to come back to me on the present state of play concerning drafters of legislation in the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">When the Taoiseach was in reflective mood responding to Deputy Ó Caoláin, he talked about the value of the committee system and the very valuable work that is done on legislation in committees.  I agree with him about that.  However, there is legislation which the Government stated it wished to have enacted before the end of the year, namely, the Bill to take the medical card from pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">After this week there will be only six sitting days before Christmas.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree this important legislation should get the fullest debate and examination in the House, on Committee Stage and other stages.  When will the Government publish the Bill in which it threatened to take the medical card from pensioners?  How much time will be provided in the House for that Bill to be debated?  Is the Government going to try to railroad it through and get it passed in the middle of the night in the hope that nobody will notice it?</p>

            <p eId="para_214">——which I would greatly welcome, I will answer.  That Bill was approved by Government this week.  Its purpose, simply, is to amend the Health Acts in respect of the automatic entitlement, regarding means.  As the Deputy knows, the reforms we are to introduce mean that 19 of 20 existing cardholders will retain their medical card entitlement.  The change will concern people on incomes well above €75,000.  That would be the cut off limit for a medical card for people over 70 years of age.</p>

            <p eId="para_218">The Deputy will be aware of the public announcements concerning this matter.  The Bill will reflect the announcements made at the time.  The welcome reform of the fee arrangements with general practitioners has enabled us to ensure that the impact will be minimal on those who were in receipt of medical cards in the past, regardless of means.  Those in that age group who require medical cards will retain their cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">It is important that the Bill be enacted before Christmas for the reasons I have given.  It will bring certainty to the issue.  There is no reason why this should not take place before the end of the session.  It is a matter for the Whips to work out the arrangements but it is the intention of Government to enact the legislation.  This is consistent with the public announcements which have been well articulated and communicated to the public at this stage.</p>

Deputies on all sides of the House are locked away in committee rooms for considerable periods and receive no coverage.

This follows the Government's decision to make changes in respect of medical cards for those aged over 70.  Yesterday the Government approved the Bill concerning medical cards.  Can the Taoiseach give any indication when the legislative changes dealing with the IMO on this matter will take place?  Direct talks with general practitioners will be required.  Is it intended to include the Dental Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union in that legislation?  Those bodies are central to the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_235">I refer Deputy Kenny to the statement made by Government at the time on these matters.  It involved a commitment to work to see if we could bring forward a provision under the Competition Act that would be consistent with EU law.  That is where the issue must begin and that was in the public statement.  The organisation concerned would be well aware of the nature of the commitment and the bona fides of Government to work in that respect.  However, legislation must be consistent with EU law and therefore the question of its publication can only arise when that issue has been resolved and dealt with after further discussion.  On the basis of the implementation of these arrangements, a statutory basis is being sought in the context of publication of the Bill and its enactment before the end of this term.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">With regard to other organisations, the commitment relates to the IMO, based on legal advice.  One cannot assume, because of the nature of the activities of other professional organisations, that they come under the same umbrella.  It is not necessarily the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_242">The fifth periodic report on the work of the National Economic and Social Forum was published in July of this year.  As required under Section 8(2)(<i>c</i>) of the National Economic and Social Development Act, the report was submitted to Government prior to publication.  Copies of the report have also been laid in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">This periodic report covers reports published by the NESF between 2003 and 2006.  In broad terms, its purpose is to review implementation and follow through, mainly by Government Departments and State agencies, of the proposals contained in the reports covered.  The fifth periodic report reviews the work published by the forum on the following topics: labour market issues for older people, equality policies for lesbian, gay and bisexual people, the policy implications of social capital, early childhood care and education, care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">Questions in relation to specific policy areas would be appropriate for reply by the Minister with the relevant responsibility.  The next report I expect to receive from the NESF is that relating to the fifth meeting of the Social Inclusion Forum, which took place last week in Croke Park.  A conference report on the proceedings will be published and circulated to each Member of the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_245">Is the Taoiseach aware that the fifth periodic report of the work of the National Economic and Social Forum states that Ireland continues to rate among the lowest investors in early childhood care and education?  Does he accept that little progress has been made regarding the implementation of the policy decisions set out in the Government's White Paper on early childhood care and education, which if he recalls, was published in 1999?</p>
            <p eId="para_246">What is the Taoiseach's position on the central recommendation of the report of the NESF to the effect that the State should provide and fund high quality care for children in the year before they commence their primary school education?  Will he not accept that it is a damning indictment of the Government's record on child care that a body such as the NESF, which was established by the Government, would outline with such forcefulness its concern and recognition of the failure of Government to act in the interests of young people?  How will he rectify this major failure to invest in young children here in this country?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_169">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_247">I do not accept the contention that there has not been major investment in young people in this country.  On the contrary, billions of euro are being expended in respect of child care and early child care supplement.  There has been a doubling and more in the education budget in recent years together with an historic capital investment programme to improve the working environment in which teachers educate children, apart from the very large expansion in child care services taking place in the health service.  Therefore, I reject the contention that there is no investment in child care issues in Ireland — quite the contrary.  All of this is being addressed within the programme of Towards 2016 and the social partnership framework for these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">Regarding the function of the NESF, it is charged with advising the Taoiseach on policies to achieve greater equality and social inclusion, as well as on such other matters as may be specified by the Taoiseach in the context of social partnership arrangements — by analysing, evaluating and monitoring viable programmes and policies — and to facilitate public consultation on policy matters as referred to by the Government from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">The NESF's advisory role is well respected and well noted.  With regard to the specific report mentioned by the Deputy, the NESF welcomed the Government's decision to establish the Office of the Minister for Children, which plays a lead role in driving forward the process of change and reform in this sector.  The work of county and city child care committees was also commended.  The forum noted the establishment of an interdepartmental group to develop a national child care training strategy and the launch of national guidelines for child minders, which are positive developments in this area.  The NESF further noted that regulations in the area of inspection and evaluation of pre-school facilities are to be strengthened and published.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">In the report, the forum expressed regret that little strategic attention has yet been paid to reform of primary schools in terms of facilities, etc., and also expresses disappointment that one of its key recommendations, namely, the Government provision, free of charge, of a high quality pre-school session of 3.5 hours a day for all children, has not been accepted.  That is noted and we shall continue, as resources allow, to consider these matters.  However, I do not accept the very negative orientation that was put by the Deputy.</p>

I should like to know what this is about, because the Government is now briefing the Finnish Government and will then brief the German Government and Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg.

However, I cannot pre-empt the discussions that are taking place with the Taoiseach and the Heads of State.

          <p eId="para_273">I agree with Deputy Kenny on the necessity for briefing on the issue of the Government's response at the European Council in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  I attended a meeting this week of leaders of Labour and Social Democratic Parties throughout the 27 member states, including a number of Heads of Government.  There was some speculation as to what the elements of the Taoiseach's response might be at the Council meeting, whatever the basis for that speculation.  The speculation was on matters new to me.  There is, therefore, a necessity for briefing on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">This House established the Moriarty tribunal in September 1997.  Under its terms of reference, it is required to report directly to the House through the Clerk of the Dáil.  Members will be aware that on Sunday, <i>The Sunday Times</i> carried a report that two newspapers in this jurisdiction were threatened with court injunctions last weekend if they published material reported to be contained in the draft report of the Moriarty tribunal.  I understand that one newspaper had to pulp a large number of copies of its newspaper that had already been printed.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Yesterday, a second newspaper, based in Britain, suggested that the Government was concerned about certain findings in the draft report and that this could entail a further battle through the courts between the Government and the tribunal.  The House is currently awash with rumours about what may be contained in the draft report and about what is going on.  Therefore, I seek clarification on some points.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">First, will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle inform us whether any communication has been received from the tribunal by the House as to when the final report will be published?  Has he any information as to what is going on?  Will the Tánaiste inform us whether the Government collectively, or any individual Members of it, have seen draft sections of the report?

It has been suggested to me that one Department, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, issued an initial statement on Friday night stating that the Government had rejected the findings of the tribunal.

Has the Government or any individual Minister received the report?

I will certainly not speculate on anything that may or may not have been, rightly or wrongly, in the newspapers.

Some of those recommendations may not require legislation and can be incorporated either in existing legislation or by way of regulation, while others will require new legislative measures.  I hope this matter can be brought to finality very quickly and all the Ministers have put together the heads required to produce a composite piece of legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">The Labour Party strongly opposes the proposal to abolish the Combat Poverty Agency.  We have discussed this on previous occasions.  It is incredible that the first agency to be the target of cuts should be the Combat Poverty Agency, a body that has done a significant amount of valuable work over more than 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">It was set up as an independent agency to conduct research into the area and to take a much more concerted approach to the issue of poverty.  Rather than mere generalisation, one of its principal functions was to engage in evidence-based research which was made available to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Another function, which was critical, was to create public awareness of the issues surrounding poverty, the causes of poverty and the way in which it can be effectively tackled.  That is probably one of the most important functions the Combat Poverty Agency has performed in recent years.  It is something of which I suppose we all need to be reminded on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We have come through a period where there was much personal satisfaction with increased levels of wealth, etc., and much emphasis on everybody having a great time.  Encouraged by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, it was all about partying on and spend, spend, spend.  In the context of that kind of frenzy, it was more important than ever to have the Combat Poverty Agency to remind people that, irrespective of the booming economy, there were significant levels of poverty within society and steps needed to be taken to tackle them.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Minister went about setting up a review group to look at the options.  That review group recommended two options and, of course, the Minister took the less popular one to absorb the Combat Poverty Agency back into the social inclusion unit in her Department.  While good work is done by that unit, as I stated already, it cannot in any way be considered an independent unit.  For example, I cite the unit's assessment of the budget, which, the Minister would have to accept, was less than critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">There is a need for such a separate independent body.  That independence is critical in terms of challenging the Government and the Minister.  As I stated on Committee Stage, there is no way that civil servants working in a unit within the Department — I do not blame civil servants — will have the independence to come out and criticise the Government or the Minister.  An important aspect of the work of the Combat Poverty Agency will be lost forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">This is a retrograde step.  The Minister has already admitted that there are no substantial savings involved in this move and the only conclusion to which I can come is that she is doing this purely for political reasons — to silence the Combat Poverty Agency and criticism of herself.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">As we head into a difficult economic period, now more than ever there is a need to hear that voice supporting those who are excluded and those who will face into unemployment and financial hardship over the coming months and years.  It is certainly a bad time, if there was ever a good time, to make this move.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">It is a retrograde step.  Deputy Hanafin, will go down in history as the Minister who abolished, and silenced or muzzled, the Combat Poverty Agency.  That is something of which to be ashamed.  The Labour Party wholeheartedly rejects her proposals to do this.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_398">I support this amendment.  Indeed, Fine Gael has tabled, along with the other parties, an amendment towards the end of the Bill against the entire section.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I do not know whether the decision to abolish the Combat Poverty Agency is one which the Government will regret, but it is certainly one that society will regret.  After the decision was made, the Combat Poverty Agency's staff and former staff went on the record on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Minister is hiding behind the fact that a review was carried out before the decision was taken.  At the beginning the Combat Poverty Agency thought the review was a good idea because it was not afraid to have its operations examined to see where improvements could be made.  After a few months of constantly looking for the terms of reference of the review, the agency eventually got them.  They were shocked to discover that no mention was made of the word "poverty", the abolition of which is the agency's main focus.  It was clear that decisions had been taken before the review was carried out because the Government knew the outcome it wanted.  Over the past several weeks, people have discussed the various cuts made in the budget but the Government has used the economy as a defence.  As the Minister has admitted, however, this cut will make few, if any, financial savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">It is legitimate to ask why the agencies which the Government has chosen to abolish or amalgamate are the ones which have the ability and courage to comment on Government policy.  The Combat Poverty Agency, the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority have commented when they were not happy with Government policies and now they are about to be silenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Every time we have discussed this matter, the Minister has failed to guarantee any degree of independence to the Office for Social Inclusion once it subsumes the Combat Poverty Agency.  The people who work in the office have a job to perform and I respect them for their work but I do not believe they will have independence in deciding what to examine.  One of the most positive aspects of the Combat Poverty Agency's role is that it decides for itself the issues that warrant scrutiny rather than following Government agendas.  The agency was regularly commissioned by other State agencies, including the HSE and local authorities, to carry out research.  I cannot see the Office for Social Inclusion having a remit in that regard.  During the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister claimed that her Department is already conducting research here, there and everywhere.  I tabled a parliamentary question to ascertain the research being conducted and received a one line reply promising a more detailed response.  It is a pity this information was not available before Report Stage because it would have allowed us to evaluate the work being carried out by her Department before we put the Bill to bed this evening.  I guarantee Deputies that the Office for Social Inclusion will not have the independence that the Combat Poverty Agency has enjoyed nor will it have the ability to interact with the community pillar in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I have seen the links that have been forged in my constituency between the county council, the HSE and the agency through working together on various programmes.  One such programme, building healthy communities, was launched by the Taoiseach several months ago.  I do not believe the Office for Social Inclusion will be able to build the same relationships with community groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Will the officials in the Office for Social Inclusion have similar expertise and backgrounds to the staff of the Combat Poverty Agency in terms of social policy and health research and community development?  They may be equally qualified but it is important that they have experience in conducting research in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">In abolishing the Combat Poverty Agency, the Minister is making a mistake she will probably regret.  Sooner or later she will be on this side of the House and the Office for Social Inclusion will be reporting to the Minister of the day.  The decision represents a real loss for democracy.  The Government seems to view the agency as a bit of a nuisance that it could do without because it does not want to be on the receiving end of criticism.  As Deputy Shortall noted, unemployment and the numbers of people who find themselves in financial difficulties are increasing.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul expects more people to seek its services over the coming year than has been the case for many years.  Now more than ever, the expertise of the Combat Poverty Agency is needed.  We will regret its loss in the difficult times to come.  I ask the Minister to reconsider her proposal and, if she does not, we will certainly be voting against it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_406">I have tabled a number of amendments on this issue, including amendment No. 37 with Deputies Enright and Shortall and amendments Nos. 38 to 45, inclusive, in my own name.  One of the most dishonest aspects of this Bill has been the Minister's introduction on Committee Stage of an amendment to abolish the Combat Poverty Agency.  It is ironic that at a time when examining and monitoring poverty are probably more important than ever before in the history of this State, these functions are being transferred to the Office for Social Inclusion.  That office will not fulfil the objectives set out for the Combat Poverty Agency because its work is completely at the whim of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is at present receiving a greater number of calls for help than at any point in its history.  As the economic crisis deepens and greater numbers of people become impoverished, we need an organisation with the skills and specific reporting and monitoring functions of the Combat Poverty Agency.  It is downright sinister, therefore, that the Minister is silencing this voice.  A board member of the agency has described the decision as the systematic tearing apart of the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The reason for the decision is clearly because the Government does not want its mismanagement of the economy or the true levels of poverty and discrimination to be revealed to the public.  The wastage of the public finances that has taken place over a considerable period of time could easily have eradicated poverty if the money had been used to implement the reports and recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency.  We would have been left with a different society and the economy would have been in a much stronger position to weather this downturn.  It is an ominous sign that the Government is going to bury its head in the sand and will try to conceal from the public the true depth of the catastrophe over which it is presiding.  Its response will be to silence the voice and allow poverty to increase.  That is grossly unacceptable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I support my colleague, Deputy Enright, on these amendments.  I have twice served on the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, an experience which has allowed me to understand the benefits of the Combat Poverty Agency.  Fine Gael has clearly outlined our difficulties with quangos, many of which exist for fairly spurious reasons.  It is strange, however, that the first body which the Government has decided to abolish is one that has given us independent advice on poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I do not always concur with my colleague from Louth, Deputy Morgan, but I support what he has said in regard to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The society's need for additional funds gives us an indication of the situation that the poor are facing.  It is not only those on social welfare or the down and out who are being affected because many people on middle incomes have lost their jobs or are facing mortgage problems.  They are trying to pay their bills rather than feed themselves.  I urge the Minister to reconsider her decision before it is too late.  The Combat Poverty Agency has been very straightforward and has done its job in an apolitical fashion.  It puts together facts and delivers them for the use of the Government as well as other people, such as those of us in Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This is a devious device, which is not in the Minister's nature.  It is creating a wall of silence with regard to this group that should not pertain.  Perhaps we can encourage the Minister to rethink what she is doing.  She cannot take this organisation into the structures of the Department and ensure it will be able to speak with a completely independent voice.  That is not possible.  Will the Minister tell us exactly what savings will be created by doing this and how it can be justified?</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I appreciate fully the views of Members in saying the Combat Poverty Agency has done valuable work over the past 20 years.  Nobody is questioning the work done by the agency through research, project work and the voice it gave to people experiencing poverty, a particular skill of the body.  It also highlighted issues to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Over those 20 years, new structures have been put in place and new methods to hear that voice have been implemented.  There should be new ways to ensure research is carried out at a national and European level.  Acting in good faith the Government decided in June 2007 to conduct a review to see what was the best role for the Combat Poverty Agency in the future and how it could integrate with all the other established structures.  It considered how the work could continue to the best advantage of those people experiencing poverty.  It was not a budget-related issue and was not about savings, so it would be wrong to see it that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The group spent over a year looking at all the issues and came up with clear proposals.  The report states that linking the CPA and the National Economic and Social Development Office bodies would be viable but there are some strong caveats to this.  The report explains how different their roles are, how there is a mismatch and how there is already an ongoing review of NESDO.  Ultimately, under the recommendations heading, the review states that the steering group recommends that the Office for Social Inclusion and the Combat Poverty Agency should be integrated.  It is a clear recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The recommendation goes on to indicate, importantly, that this would be to the "mutual strengthening and enhancement" of the bodies.  I am the first to accept that the office of social inclusion must be enhanced and strengthened, which is also recognised in this report.  The way of ensuring both bodies can work to the best interests of combating poverty is to ensure we merge them and use the best skills and expertise from both.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Different organisations and research has emerged over the years.  This morning, for example, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions results for 2007 were published; this process was not available 20 years ago and it provides very valuable, objective and honest information, as does the live register.  There are some figures to be worried about but there are also some very encouraging figures that I have no doubt we will discuss here at another time.  These are just a few examples of the information available.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">There is also Central Statistics Office research and reports and, more particularly, there is the social partnership process which has not only emerged but developed as a strong part of society and all our dealings with employers, workers and vulnerable or community groups.  That community and voluntary pillar is now an essential part of the process, although it was not the case when the Combat Poverty Agency was established.  We now have the social partnership deal of Towards 2016; the national action plans for social inclusion, the social inclusion elements of the national development plans and all the other structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I mentioned last week the social inclusion forum which gathered a few hundred people to do very practical and good work last week.  We have the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and the various offices within Departments that deal with social inclusion, be it in my own Department or my former Department dealing with education.  That did all the work on the DEIS schools.  There is also the senior officials group, the EU open method of co-ordination and various groups now doing at least some of the work that the Combat Poverty Agency was doing.  There was an overlap and it was legitimate to set up the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The recommendations are also very clear and I have adopted them.  This is not about abolishing the Combat Poverty Agency but rather the abolition of poverty and the aim to eliminate it.  It will be difficult in the times we are living in, which we recognise.  As with any Minister in this position, I am to play my part in eliminating poverty, and this is linked in many ways to what we are doing.  I want to ensure that as Minister, and with all future Ministers, we will have the best benefits of the very best research and expertise, as well as the voice of the people experiencing poverty.  There should be a strong central unit within the Department of Social and Family Affairs that can advise Government and ensure all Departments are aware of the best policies to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Such a unit should initiate research on issues it believes important.  I am a very strong advocate of ensuring we have independent research and evidence-based policies.  That will mean investigating and carrying out research on issues that we may not yet have thought of.  That is why I expect such a unit to come up with a very good work programme that will be part and parcel of what it must do.  I expect the unit to formulate proposals and initiatives that Government agencies and Departments can take on board as part of our central policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">There is some excellent expertise in both sections but it can become even better by merging the two bodies.  In fairness to both the board and staff from the agency I have met, they are more than willing to ensure that expertise will be harnessed in a very positive way.  They have particular skills in giving a voice to poverty, which the Department has not done in the past, <i>per se</i>.  These people will be able to bring such expertise with them and ensure we can do it in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Research has been central both to the Department and the Combat Poverty Agency.  The Department will give information to any Deputy and I mentioned some sources in the past week when we were on Committee Stage.  Some of the pieces of research published recently by the Department include the Life Cycle Perspective on Social Inclusion in Ireland: An Analysis of EU-SILC; Tackling Low Income and Deprivation: Developing Effective Policies; and A Social Portrait of People of Working Age in Ireland.  They are from this year, so we commission and publish valuable research, making it available to anybody interested in the public.  This is not about silencing the voice of poverty or issues relating to it.</p>

They are also interested to know if we have the correct information to help us do it.  By integrating the office of social inclusion and the Combat Poverty Agency we will get exactly what the steering group recommended — the strengthening and enhancement of both.  We will have close alliances of great expertise and we will be able to use it in the best interests of people experiencing poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">There are many amendments relating to staff and functions, which we can deal with on an individual basis.  It is important that the overall message is very clear; this is about ensuring the work, expertise and the voice of combating poverty in this country is strengthened as part of a unit that will have direct access and even more influence over Government policy than heretofore.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_428">The Minister's comments are cynical in the extreme.  She is misleading the House and there are no two ways about that.  She says she is looking at how the work of the Combat Poverty Agency can continue, but that is not what the Bill is about.  The Minister should have the courage to say honestly that this is about abolishing the agency because it has been a thorn in her side and she does not want to hear what it has to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Minister says she is interested in abolishing poverty, not the Combat Poverty Agency, but that is not true.  If the Government was unable to abolish poverty during the past decade, when there was a boom on and endless money available, how can it possibly do so now when times are much more difficult?  Not only is the Minister abolishing the Combat Poverty Agency, but she is also abolishing the agency's functions which are listed in the legislation.  It will no longer be the responsibility of any agency to perform those functions, which were so clearly identified in 1986 by the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Frank Cluskey.  He identified the fact that there is an inherent reluctance by most Governments to face up to the extent of poverty.  That is why the independent nature of the Combat Poverty Agency was so critical.  It had to perform its role, irrespective of the colour of whatever Government happened to be in power.  That agency operated on the basis of independent research, which is honest about the extent of poverty and the obstacles preventing the Government from dealing with it.  The agency also sought to increase public awareness of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The alternative proposal to incorporate the agency into the National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, would have had some merit in so far as there was some prospect of independence there.  Incorporating it into the social inclusion unit will mean that it will just vanish in time, but I think that was the intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Minister lists all the other bodies that have responsibility for tackling poverty but clearly the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion should be a key body with such responsibility.  From the information that was disclosed to us recently, however, we know that from February to last week that sub-committee did not meet at all, in spite of severely worsening unemployment and the general situation concerning poverty.  The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion did not bother to meet for ten months, so the Minister should not tell me that it will provide a watchdog role that is so necessary to tackle poverty.  This is a smokescreen.  The only purpose of abolishing the Combat Poverty Agency is to silence a body that has done extremely good work in the past.  The agency put it up to successive Governments to remember the poor and tackle the problems associated with poverty in a real and meaningful way.  This is a shameful exercise and the Minister should withdraw the proposal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_432">The Minister's approach to this matter is totally disingenuous and illogical.  On the one hand, she talks about the great work done by the Combat Poverty Agency over the last 20 years and heaps praise on it, yet on the other hand she is still going to abolish the agency.  That body was doing great work and could have continued to do so, regardless of the Minister's listing of other bodies' reports that have been published in recent years.  The Combat Poverty Agency still has a role to play and the fact that the change will bring about little or no cost savings makes the Minister's decision even more illogical.  She spoke about the voice the agency gave people, but the EU body she mentioned does not give the same voice to local people here.  It will not interact with local community groups, as the Combat Poverty Agency did.  While she may not admit it, the Minister must realise that her office for social inclusion will not be able to do so either.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Minister spoke about integration and how her office will work to the best advantage of those experiencing poverty.  Her decision, however, will have the opposite effect because silencing, closing down and subsuming the agency into her Department will not be advantageous to those living in poverty.  The notion of the steering review group is that the decision will lead to the mutual strengthening and enhancement of both bodies.  I do not doubt that it will be to the enhancement of the Office for Social Inclusion because of the expertise of those who have had the benefit of working with other agencies in the community pillar.  Such a move will strengthen the Office for Social Inclusion to some degree, but it will not be sufficient to deal with the scale of the existing problems arising from poverty.  Nor will that office have the hands-on ability the Combat Poverty Agency had in working with other groups, including local authorities and the community pillar.  Today's seasonally adjusted live register figures show that there are 277,000 people out of work.  That in itself should be a reminder to the Minister of the importance of that agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In her response, the Minister dealt with research documents that have been published, but one of the most important aspects of the Combat Poverty Agency was that it was not just about reaction.  The Government's approach, however, has been reactive rather than proactively examining what needs to be done.  The agency had the time and ability to research problems coming down the track and then publish its advice.  The Office for Social Inclusion will not have the ability to do that because it will be reacting full time to the political issues of the day, which is what the Minister will tell it to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">Let us assume for one moment that the Minister is sincere in declaring that this decision is not about silencing the voice of the Combat Poverty Agency.  In that event, why will she not accept amendments Nos. 39 to 45, inclusive?  Amendment No. 39 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_436">In page 24, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_437">"31.—The new division established by the integration of the Agency with the Office of Social Inclusion shall examine the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State for the purpose, commission and interpretation of research independently of the Minister.".</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Amendment No. 40 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_439">In page 24, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_440">"31.—The new division established by the integration of the Agency with the Office of Social Inclusion shall promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty independently of the Minister.".</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The subsequent amendments, up to and including No. 45, contain similar wording.  If this is not about silencing the voice of the Combat Poverty Agency and stopping it from revealing the extent and nature of poverty across the State, why will the Minister not accept those amendments specifically?  I ask her to address that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">As to her comments on the review group's recommendations, nobody in this House would be fooled by such a proposition.  We all know the saying that "He who pays the piper, calls the tune", so we will not fall for that one.  The Minister said the recommendations included the mutual enhancement of both bodies, but that is utter nonsense.  On Committee Stage, she could not even tell us how much will be saved by the amalgamation of both bodies.  Can she do so now?  This is more about silencing than saving, which is why the figures have not been examined.  The priority is to shut the messenger up and ensure that message does not get out by wiping the agency off the board.  The Bill marks a significant change of direction by the Government, which will damage society.  It will also significantly lessen the opportunity for a swathe of society, including politicians and sociologists, to deal with what is happening.  That is most regrettable.</p>

I have no doubt that the new division will carry out research, give policy advice and provide data analysis.  It will ensure that the voice it gives to those experiencing poverty can be heard.  The agency has worked well with people so that they can participate at national and European levels and have their voices heard directly rather than via another group.  I envisage this situation continuing.  I also envisage that the division will initiate research on issues it believes to be important, which is part of its remit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_473">One gets the recommendation one pays for.  Throughout the debate, the Minister has sought to distort reality.  Under no circumstances can it be said that the CPA can continue or improve its work if it is subsumed into the Department.  The critical aspect of the CPA is its courage and freedom to speak out, as it is an independent body.  It was enabled to be a voice for those who do not normally have one, the poor, because it was independent.  It can decide what research in which to engage and how to portray the issues at the heart of poverty.  Often, they were portrayed in a way that was not favourable to the Government of the day.  The agency's independence is its main benefit and strength.  At times, it was a thorn in the Government's side.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is misleading of the Minister to state that she wants to see the agency continue its good work.  Were that the case, why does she not allow it to continue as an independent agency?  She wants to silence it.  To say that the agency can continue its work within the Department is nonsense, since the Minister knows that it cannot.  There is no tradition of civil servants being openly critical of Ministers.  The agency will be silenced.  Someone else will choose what research work will be carried out and how the findings will be portrayed.  Consequently, the agency will lose the strength it derived from independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">A further important aspect of the CPA's work lay in how it went into communities and found out what was occurring therein.  Rather than examining global figures on a national basis, it considered the underlying reasons for our high levels of educational disadvantage, for example.  A worthwhile CPA project in Donegal examined why there was a low uptake of medical cards among marginalised people.  It drills down into problems to determine the underlying issues and which policies need to change.  This will not be the case from now on.  The work will be restricted by the Department, which will not want critical and unfavourable information about it to emerge.  It is a retrograde step and a shameful move.  The Minister will go down in history as the Minister who silenced any criticism in terms of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The most serious issue is not that the Bill will do away with the CPA.  Rather, those who depend on the CPA to have their voices heard will no longer be heard to the same extent.  This is a bad move and a big mistake that we will oppose vehemently.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_615">In page 6, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_616">"‘Anti-Fraud Initiatives' means those programmes, measures or actions designed to eliminate fraudulent claims in respect of all payments made under the Principal Act, as amended;".</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Fine Gael is putting forward this amendment because it believes substantial savings can be made through greater vigilance on the part of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in terms of combating fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Minister has pledged to save €25 million through increased anti-fraud activity.  Through her U-turn on the removal of the disability allowance from children between the ages of 16 and 18 and it not being replaced by the domiciliary care allowance, she hopes to make another saving of €4.4 million.  The Minister hopes to make, between July and 31 December, savings of €30 million through extra anti-fraud measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The amendment seeks to give definition to the term "anti-fraud measures".  I am seeking to ascertain if the Minister intends to recoup payments in respect of fraudulent claims made prior to July of this year.  That that depth of savings can be made in six months, requires the Minister to examine what other payments made prior to July should not have been made.  This would be of benefit to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and would ensure that people who need payments are able to get them.  That is the principal reason for this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I believe there is scope for increased controls, in particular controls at airports and so on.  The Minister will be aware of the case raised previously during Question Time, namely, the substantial savings of more than €1 million a year made by a garda involved in this area.  From August to December 2004 alone, a saving of €1.468 million was generated through the termination of 234 claims.  There is a lot of scope for greater controls in this area.  The amendment seeks to ensure that anti-fraud initiatives are enshrined in legislation and as such will become a serious focus of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>

I acknowledge progress has been made in this area in recent times.  However, I believe more work needs to be done in this regard.  For that reason, I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_623">I do not propose to accept the amendment because legislation is already in place that comprehensively provides for control activity, which is a feature of all social welfare schemes.  I share the concern expressed by the Deputies in terms of ensuring we have in place proper control measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Currently, we do so in four different ways, namely, prevention, detection, deterrent and debt recovery.  We take seriously all of our control measures.  Fraud and abuse is an issue on all agendas when discussing all aspects of departmental activity.  Deputies will be aware that staff in many of our offices are under pressure at this time owing to an increased number of claims.  Some 115 staff are being recruited to ensure claims are processed quickly and our control work is continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Fraud and abuse is examined through reviews of claim papers, home visits, mail-shots, database checking, medical reviews for illness payments and special exercises targeting specific groups.  We stop payments, seek refunds of moneys paid and even take prosecutions in respect of claims.  Last year, 361 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for legal proceedings, 243 of which were finalised in court.  Also, 26 cases of impersonation were followed up.  We have taken action against employers who do not make PRSI contributions.  A key area has been that of child benefit.  Deputies will be aware that as of summer this year all new applicants signing for the jobseeker's allowance are required to sign on once a month and to collect their payments at the post office.  This measure was put in place to ensure people are in the country and genuinely seeking work rather than simply receiving funds by way of electronic payment and, perhaps, slipping in and out of the country.  This has been successful as a control measure as has been the action we have taken in respect of child benefit in terms of the issuance of certification letters.  These are being issued monthly to EU workers resident here whose families are resident abroad.  Substantial savings are being made in this regard.  So far, 5,000 claims for child benefit have ceased.  Also, up to end October approximately €38 million had been saved under child benefit, the payments for which are high in this country, and €11 million was saved in respect of the early childhood supplement, a total saving of approximately €50 million.  This saving has been made as a result of control measures introduced by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">We will continue to exercise our control measures and will seek to ensure that even further measures are introduced.  On whether the Department seeks to recoup money, the answer is "Yes",  bearing in mind the ability of the person to pay, the period within which repayment is required and whether it is possible to pursue the money in terms of activity versus the amount to be recouped to the Department.  Combating fraud and abuse is a serious part of the Department's work.  Approximately 600 people who work in the Department are involved in this area.  Even though the budget for my Department is €19.6 billion the demands on it are great, as is the case in respect of every other Department.  We want to ensure the money is going to the right people.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">While I share the sentiments expressed, we have in place the legislative framework to enable us do our work and, as such, I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_628">I will not press this too far.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that €50 million in savings has been made.  However, this causes me to question how much money has been wasted during the past number of years.  If such savings have been made as a result of the detection of payments to people not eligible or entitled to them or by people who were deliberately claiming them when they should not have been doing so, the loss of money to the Exchequer, and the Department, is substantial.  Savings of €50,000 in the period outlined by the Minister amounts to a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The same point can be made about child benefit payments.  If €38 million in savings were made under that scheme — from what the Minister said, I gather they were made this year — and 5,000 claims were stopped, this amounts to a substantial amount of money being claimed that should not have been claimed.  I have tabled questions on this, but in Question Time today questions are not to the Minister's Department.  I would like to know how much was paid out in fraudulent claims that should not have been paid out.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The Minister said it was important she took prosecutions on foot of some of the claims and so on, yet 5,000 claims for child benefit were stopped and no prosecutions were taken on foot of them.  I can understand that in some cases people could not afford to pay up, but 5,000 people were not entitled to that benefit and I cannot imagine all of them were in circumstances such that they should not have been the subject of prosecutions for claiming fraudulently.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I appreciate very much that the Minister's staff were under pressure.  I welcome the fact that finally more people have been assigned to deal with the backlogs.  Staffing being under pressure is one matter but this whole system being under pressure because of benefit payments being made to people who were not entitled to them and people needing money who cannot get it as a result of that puts families under pressure.  The Minister needs to examine the entire operation of the system to ensure staff are able to devote sufficient time to deal with the issue of fraudulent claims.  I appreciate that a staff of 600 are dealing with this, but many of them do other work as well.  It is crucial that this is done.  The Minister could easily assign more staff to this work, if many of these fraudulent claims were stopped.  It would certainly represent value for taxpayers' money if more staff were assigned to deal with this matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_632">In recent years fraud and error surveys were undertaken for a number of the schemes, namely, child benefit and the family income supplement in 2004, the disability allowance in 2005, the PPSN allocation and the illness benefit in 2006, the State pension non-contributory scheme in 2007, the State pension contributory scheme in 2008 and review policies are now being finalised for the disability allowance, carer's allowance and the State pension non-contributory schemes.  We are very much trying to keep on top of all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Bearing in mind that a claim is only stopped when we know for a fact that the person is no longer entitled to it, it can be difficult to ascertain exactly how long prior to that the person was not entitled to it, particularly if that person has left the country.  Of the 5,000 claims for child benefit payments stopped, 80% of them applied to non-nationals.  They may well have been people who were working here legitimately and then found themselves without a job and have now left the country and that may have happened in the past few months.  At the time of writing to them and they not responding, it involved 5,000 claims.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I do not want to give the impression that everybody is on the make in regard to such payments.  The electronic transfer system ensures the automatic transfer of payments and it is a smooth and efficient way of going about our business, but sometimes people may continue to claim or forget to claim and there can be a good reason for that, but we are clamping down on payments that should not be made.  We will continue to do that and we will increase the amount of such activity, particularly in regard to child benefit claims, in the coming months.  On all of our schemes, control is a serious element.  The Deputy is right in saying this is taxpayers' money and it is urgently needed for those people who deserve it.</p>

If they were notified, payments should have ceased then, but payments continued to be made to them.  There was some period for which they received payments that they should not have received them.  This issue needs more attention across the board in terms of all payments.  We are under some time pressure and I will not press this amendment.</p>

There is not a clearer example of the Government talking out of both sides of its mouth than if we compare and contrast its introduction of the 1% income levy.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_660">The 2009 budget was prepared against the background of a serious deterioration in the national finances.  The limited resources available meant that difficult choices had to be made between competing demands.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">My priority in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agrifood sector.  The 2009 Estimates provide over €1.8 billion for my Department and, when combined with EU funding of €1.4 billion, that means total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to more than €3.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">In regard to the early retirement scheme and the young farmers installation aid scheme, all fully completed applications received by the Department up to and including 14 October 2008 will be processed and, if they are in order, payment will be made.  An allocation of €56.7 million has been made for 2009 to meet current commitments under the scheme of early retirement from farming and the young farmers installation aid scheme, but, for the present, it has been necessary to suspend new applications for those schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the rural environment protection scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17%, the new suckler cow welfare scheme, the farm waste management scheme and an 8% increase in rates under the disadvantaged areas scheme introduced in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">I have no plans at present to re-open the young farmers installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme to new applications, but the limiting of the suspension of the scheme will be considered at the earliest opportunity having regard to the general budgetary situation.</p>

I would like if the Minister would agree to open the scheme immediately.  I have no doubt that if the times were better financially the Minister would agree to do that, but there is a category of people in respect of both the installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme who have entered into legally irrevocable contracts and who, through no fault of their own, are now in a difficult situation.  We would all like to see the scheme re-open for everybody, but in those exceptional circumstances will the Department look favourably on those individual would-be applicants?</p>

            <p eId="para_666">I indicated to Deputy Creed previously when we met to discuss those issues and in reply to a previous parliamentary question that people whose applications were significantly progressed at the time entry to the schemes were suspended are a priority for me and will be a priority when we start processing and revisiting that decision.  That is a view shared by all of us who represent rural areas and who are familiar with individuals and families who had started the preparatory work but who had not completed or lodged their applications with the Department prior to budget day.  I am aware from public representatives such as from the Members present and other colleagues on both sides of the House, and from the farming organisations, all of whom spoke to me about the matter, that a number of applications now stand suspended that were almost ready on budget day.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">I have stated repeatedly in the House and in response to councillors, representatives of various farming organisations and in the media that it is my intention to revisit my decision to suspend entry to the schemes as soon as circumstances permit.  All of us who deal with representations from rural communities fully appreciate that a considerable amount of effort goes into the completion of a valid application.  In the case of installation aid, young farmers went into considerable detail to meet the specific requirements of the scheme.  I understand that at times the delay in lodging applications may have been outside an applicant's power.  I am conscious of that but I do not want to mislead anybody.  I am not in a position at this time to say when we will be able to progress those particular applicants who had set out on the road to complete an application.  I assure Deputy Creed that those applicants will be the first to have their applications processed when it is possible to re-open the schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">I am disappointed with the Minister's response because I referred to a handful of applicants where there is clear evidence of a delay in probate or the Revenue stamping deeds and leases.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">Has the Minister received any legal advice on the vulnerability of the Department to a legal challenge following the suspension of the scheme?  It would appear that the principle of legitimate expectation would apply and the Department has been at the receiving end of a judgment in that respect previously.</p>

            <p eId="para_670">The scheme was suspended due to budgetary constraints and that remains the position.  Adequate provision has been made in the 2009 Estimates to meet all applications that were duly authorised and authenticated that reached the Department by budget day, should they be approved.  I hope they all meet the criteria.  I accept some people who had started to prepare their applications had gone quite a distance but, from some of the representations received by the Department, a number of the cases brought to my attention were by and large in the early stages.  As Deputy Creed indicated, we all know of applications that were nearing completion and I would like to advance them as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">The possibility of support to the sheep sector will be considered in the light of the outcome of the recent CAP health check.  That outcome provides that an additional amount of some €24 million annually will be available to Irish farmers from 2010 onwards.  That amount may be used to target specific sectors in need of assistance and represents money that would otherwise not be available to farmers due to the complex rules surrounding the single farm payment.  Support may commence in 2009 by utilising funds from the national reserve, which are expected to be in the region of €6 million to €7 million, and those will be supplemented from 2010 with the unspent single farm payment funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">As I indicated following the completion of the health check, I will consult relevant stakeholders as to how the additional funds can best be spent.  To that end, I will meet with them on 16 December to consider their views and possible options.  It is, perhaps, worth repeating what I said in this House last night when I reiterated my concern for the sheep sector in particular and acknowledged that it is a sector that needs support.  It is a priority sector and will, no doubt, feature prominently at my meeting with the farm organisations on 16 December to consider how best to spend the additional funding secured in the health check.</p>

            <p eId="para_674">By way of preamble I draw attention to how the Minister's language has shifted considerably from the statement in Limoges where he said that the sector "should be a priority for any unused funds within the CAP budget".  Last night he indicated: "I wanted to ensure that the changes in the health check initiative will open the possibility for some useful action."  Now the Minister is stating that he "may" use some of the €24 million fund to support the sheep sector.  What the farmers who are protesting on Kildare Street want to know is whether the fund will be used.  Will the Minister give a definitive commitment that he will honour the statement that was made at the conference in Limoges?  Given that the Minister has committed to meeting representatives of the sector, will he move the date of 16 December forward given that the farmers are protesting outside Leinster House?  It would be courteous if the Minister committed to meeting them earlier than 16 December.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_675">On the Deputy's question on the EU conference in France in early September, people who listen to us participated actively and constructively at the meeting.  At the conference, I outlined that the sheep sector needed assistance at EU level.  For once, the British Government and the Irish one were on the same wavelength on an agriculture issue.  The British Minister participated, as did the French Minister, Michel Barnier, acting President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, and the Ministers from Spain and Romania.  We were the only Ministers representing Governments of member states at the conference.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">I made several points at the conference, one of which was that the challenges in the sheep sector throughout the European Union required an EU-wide response.  There are unspent funds within the Irish CAP allocation and there are also unused CAP funds at EU level.  I argued that we should not only try to obtain access to our own unspent funds, such that we could use them to our own benefit as we see fit, but that we should also try to secure an EU-wide response.  I argued that some of the substantial fund that is unused within the CAP budget of the 27 member states should be diverted to the sheep sector.  However, the European Union will not agree to that.  One would need the agreement of the 27 member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">If Deputy Sherlock wants to read any of my statements or listen to any of the interviews I gave, he will note that I stated clearly, as I did last night, today and at the meeting organised by the IFA in Tullamore on the morning when the CAP health check negotiations were completed, that the sheep sector needs help.  I stated at the meeting in Tullamore that "I want to ensure that the changes in the health check open the possibility for some useful action in the sheep sector."  I have repeated that since and am looking forward to a constructive meeting with the farm organisations on 16 December.  That is the first date available because of long-standing commitments in the Dáil and elsewhere, including foreign locations, over the next two weeks.  I have no doubt that the organisations at the meeting will put forward very strong, well-supported cases on the sheep sector based on their concerns and ideas.</p>

I said at the IFA meeting at Tullamore, where I was criticised for not making a commitment, that I made a commitment to seeking to gain access to the unused funds.  I stated I wanted to ensure the changes in the CAP health check would open the possibility for some useful action in the sheep sector.  I stated at the meeting that if we were successful at the health check negotiations, I would return to the farming organisations to talk to them.  Ten minutes after the conclusion of the negotiations, I repeated this.  That is what I am doing.  The date is set for a meeting and the farm organisations have been invited to attend.

            <p eId="para_693">The agreed rates of additional modulation will generate approximately €120 million in total over the four years from 2009 to 2012 in transfers from the single farm payment to rural development.  As I have previously made clear, these additional funds will stay in Ireland and be passed back to Irish farmers under the rural development programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">Absolutely.  There may be a perception that the funds will be allocated for some rural development measures beyond the farm gate but this is not true.  The modulated funds will be allocated for on-farm activities.  The scheme or schemes we will propose to the Commission for approval will have to be linked to the new challenges of climate change, achieving biodiversity and water management.  A scheme could involve an additional REPS measure.  A grassland premium scheme, which may in some instances refer to under-grazing or over-grazing of land, could be considered.  There is a measure that can be considered in regard to dairy restructuring.  A number of schemes can be proposed but the basic requirement is that they address the new challenges of protecting the environment, enhancing biodiversity and tackling climate change.  I assure the House that all the funding will be allocated directly for on-farm activities and not to Leader type programmes or programmes that would operate beyond the farm gate.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">With the level of modulation coming in at present, we would have to put our proposal to Brussels.  The decision on whether our co-financing is adequate will be made there.  The current national Exchequer contribution to our rural development programme substantially exceeds the EU requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">We will put forward our particular programme to Brussels when we have completed consultation in respect of a scheme, or schemes.  For example, if we wished to extend the REPS programme or to introduce an animal welfare measure that might be linked directly to new challenges, we would have to put forward those proposals to Brussels for clearance.  Of our farmers, 50,000 will not be affected by modulation because they are below the single payment rate where modulation applies.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</b>
         his views on whether he has secured a good deal for Irish farmers under the CAP; the benefits to the farming sector here from the deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [44091/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_398" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_703">I am satisfied that I have secured a very good deal for Irish farmers in the recent health check negotiations.  The deal is worth €70 million in additional payments to farmers over the coming years.  In addition, the increase in milk quota will deliver €100 million worth of additional milk production in 2014.  This is enormously positive for the sector and, although there are elements in the package I do not like, such as increased modulation, I am satisfied that this will not lead to any loss to Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">The main aspects of the deal that are of interest to Ireland are that milk quotas will be increased by 1% per annum for each of the next five years and, in addition, an adjustment in the butterfat reference will mean the equivalent of an extra 2% in milk quota for Ireland next year.  Two reviews of the market situation are planned, by December 2010 and by December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">Due to our additional production potential, Ireland will benefit greatly from these changes.  If the 2% quota increase already in place for 2008 is included, an additional 500 million litres of milk will be produced in Ireland when these changes come into effect.  This was an outstanding achievement, given the alignment of forces on the Council of Ministers.  I am particularly pleased that our farmers and processors now have policy clarity and can plan their investments with a greater degree of certainty about the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">With regard to market support schemes, the system of intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder is to remain unchanged and the private storage aid mechanism for butter remains in place.  A determined effort was made to introduce tendering for every tonne of butter and skimmed milk powder intervened.  This would have been particularly difficult for Ireland given our seasonal pattern of production and therefore it was very important to secure the continuation of intervention buying-in for the first 30,000 tonnes of butter and 109,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder at the fixed price.  This was equally true for butter private storage aid where current arrangements were maintained, despite efforts to introduce tendering.  In essence, the key market management mechanisms that are most important to Ireland have been left completely unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">I was successful also in obtaining the option of using funds from the national reserve together with unused moneys from the single payment funds allocated annually to Ireland to target at specific vulnerable sectors.  A sum of €7 million is available annually in the national reserve and I secured agreement to use these funds with effect from 2009.  Under the final agreement, we will have access to additional funds of the order of €24 million annually from unspent funds from 2010, with the possibility for increasing that figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The funds can be used to address specific economic disadvantages affecting farmers in the dairy, beef and veal, sheep and goat and rice sectors.  I persuaded the Commission to expand the scope of these measures to include economically vulnerable sectors, irrespective of their geographical location.  We need to consider carefully how these funds can best be used for the development of Irish farming in the context of the options available under the new regulation. No decisions have been taken yet but I am acutely aware of the difficulties in certain sectors and I will be consulting widely with all stakeholders on this issue in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">In this regard I have already said that I would welcome proposals from interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">I was also able to progress the simplification agenda in the health check negotiations.  We got rid of the requirement to deduct modulation from the full payment due to the farmer and subsequently refund that element relating to the first €5,000.  We also succeeded in abolishing the requirement for compulsory set-aside and this will do away with the complex associated management rules.  In addition, the restriction on the transfer of national reserve entitlements is to be removed and the usage and "use it or lose it rules" have been simplified.  Simplifications were made also to the cross-compliance and good agricultural and environment condition provisions.  Most importantly, I got an unambiguous commitment from the Council of Ministers and the Commission to continue the simplification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">With regard to modulation, the rate has been increased by 5%.  I would have preferred if no additional modulation had been agreed.  However, this was one element of the negotiations on which Commissioner Fischer Boel was particularly determined.  I am satisfied that we succeeded in getting the rate of additional modulation considerably reduced from the original proposals.  It is worth noting that over 50,000 Irish farmers will be exempt from this increase.  I can confirm that there will be a budget-neutral effect in respect of the 70,000 farmers affected by the change as I have ensured that all the funds raised can be passed straight back to Irish farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">Will the Minister clarify whether the original ratio in the rural development package was to be 50:50 between EU funding and Exchequer funding?  In the event of Exchequer funding being at 25%, will the Government commit to that funding in light of the new modulation or the Common Agricultural Policy health check package?</p>

            <p eId="para_715">During recent years our Exchequer has been fortunate in that we have able to put much more funding from national resources into schemes that are partially funded by the European Union.  The ratio in some instances is more than 50% of Irish money against the percentage of EU funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_716">I welcome the Minister's statement in terms of the commitment on modulation and how it is to be ringfenced within agriculture.  That is vitally important and is something I have raised with the Minister previously.  There should be no leakage of that commitment into other sectors, or into non-governmental, community and voluntary pillars.  That is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Does the Minister not agree that the €170 million package delivered by the CAP will be delivered by farmers themselves?  The 1% increase in quota will effectively come down to the farmer who gets up every day to milk more cows.  The Minister is overselling the package somewhat.  It was widely thought that the 1% increases in quota were coming down the track in any event.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">Will the Minister explain the €70 million that is in the balance?  Some €100 million will be provided for additional milk production and there is an extra €70 million.  Will the Minister clarify how this extra sum will be designated?</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_402" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_719">I assure the Deputy that large member states such as France and Germany were totally opposed to any increase in milk quota.  We got the butterfat adjustment which is the equivalent of a 2% increase which is very important also.  All of us who speak to dairy farmers will talk of their frustration when the calculation is made with regard to butterfat.  It lifts up delivery levels as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">I was in the Deputy's constituency recently and spoke to individual farmers there who are very anxious to get additional milk quotas.  A number commented that this is the first time, to their knowledge, as it is to mine, that we succeeded in getting the butterfat adjustment.  Over the next few years, the increase in quotas amounts almost to 10%, calculating the value of the milk quota at the present poor levels that unfortunately pertain in the dairy industry.  This is an issue of concern to all of us who are involved in the sector, particularly to dairy farmers and the pressures they experienced this year.  We hope that the value will increase and that this sum of €100 million will prove a conservative estimate rather than a real one in the next year or two.  We hope that dairy prices will increase by then.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">With regard to the €70 million mentioned by Deputy Sherlock, the calculation is arrived at, roughly, by the €24 million unspent and by our being able to use the national reserve funds that we cannot use at present.  These are worth €6 million to €7 million on an annual basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">The very poor state of many whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet is clearly reflected in the decreases in annual total allowable catch, TAC, and quota allocations that Ireland receives, and in the landings of the fishing fleet over the past decade.  The levels of TAC and, ultimately, the quotas for Ireland are determined each year at the December Fisheries Council following negotiations with member states and the EU Commission.  The process for 2009 has already begun in earnest with the publication of the Commission's proposals which will be subject of detailed and protracted discussions over the coming weeks.  This Commission proposal sets out cuts in many of the stocks of economic importance to our fleet and also envisages other measures which will adversely impact on our fishing industry, including a proposed closure for the whitefish fleet off the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">However, not all stocks are subject to decreases in TACs with the mackerel TAC going up by 33%——</p>

            <p eId="para_726">——from 456,000 tonnes in 2008 to 605,000 tonnes in 2009.  This will result in the net Irish quota, after deductions for the payback for undeclared Scottish landings, going from approximately 45,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes.  However, this TAC increase remains to be formally agreed and must be protected against any proposal that a part would be transferred to Norway in the EU negotiations with Norway which are currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">This hugely significant increase is the reward for Irish fishermen adopting tough responsible fishing practices for this stock.  In value terms, using an estimated price per tonne of €1,200, this results in an increase of over €20 million to the pelagic fishing sector in 2009, from €54 million to €74.4 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Notwithstanding the good news on mackerel, I am concerned with the level of cuts proposed for the whitefish stocks, the proposed closure in the north west as well as other measures proposed and their socio-economic impact on fishermen and fishing communities.  I can assure the Deputy I am actively engaged, as are our officials, in delivering the best possible deal for Ireland and there will be many long days and late nights in the upcoming negotiations before a settlement is reached on the final package of measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The reality is, however, that we will experience cuts in some stocks though the actual level of these cuts has yet to be determined.  In that regard I expect that the downwards rebalancing of our whitefish fleet fishing capacity as a result of the current decommissioning scheme, which is permanently removing fishing vessels from the whitefish fleet, will help offset quota reductions.  The objective of the current decommissioning scheme is to deliver an efficient, effective and viable fishing fleet  capable of supporting a vibrant coastal community into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">This economic lift comes from the redistribution of the whitefish and prawn catch previously taken by the vessels being decommissioned which is currently estimated at some €22 million.  This will, over the next five years result in up to €110 million in additional catching opportunities for those boats that remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">Decommissioning was primarily intended to benefit the owners and skippers who remain in the fleet rather than those who leave and I am confident they will see the benefit of this policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_735">For a long time, I was wondering whether the Minister of State was going to answer the question.  He was just getting to it when the Acting Chairman intervened.  At last week's Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, it was stated, as regards box 6A and the total ban on whitefish fishing — cod, haddock etc. — that there was inadequate scientific evidence.  When the Minister of State goes to Europe, will he be fighting this proposal?  In the event, on what grounds will he be fighting?  We have had part decommissioning which I understood to mean fewer boats and more fish for each boat.  If we are to close fisheries such as this, will there be another round of decommissioning?</p>
            <p eId="para_736">The fishermen in the Celtic Sea, in the south and south-east coast, close the fishery for cod and white fish during the spawning season.  Why has this not been tried in box 6, rather than having a full blanket ban on it?  If box 6A is closed, I imagine that those who are fishing whitefish in that area will then move to the Celtic Sea, and that will be fished out.  No measures have been put in place to save this fishery.  All of a sudden it has been decided to close it.  This has been tried before in different fisheries.  Funnily enough, either on legal grounds or whatever, when these matters were taken to court, the Minister was defeated in different fisheries.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">We know of the consequences for the Lisbon treaty because of the way fishermen had been treated.  However, as regards the consequences of this, I should have preferred if more proactive measures had been introduced over a number of years rather than a full blanket ban.</p>

            <p eId="para_739">I shall do my best.  I wanted to respond to Deputy Sheahan as the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, have been in constant contact with the Federation of Irish Fishermen as regards working on a joint proposal to the Commission, because we are, as the Deputy said, concerned.  I gave a fuller answer in this regard in an Adjournment debate, but we are conscious of the adverse impact on our fleet of the proposed closure in the north-west area.  I believe the Commission has not undertaken normal consultation with the industry either through the regional advisory councils or by way of socio-economic evaluation.  Therefore we need to work closely with the industry so that we may suggest other measures to help protect these stocks, while having reduced impact on the fleet.  For example, we are looking at a revision of the areas of Celtic Sea cod that would reduce Ireland's quota in areas off the south and west coast and give us quota elsewhere where we do not fish.  That is where the Commission is, unfortunately, at variance with us because of the new totally allowable catch and quotas for skate and ray, for example, which we are only allowed to fish as a by-catch.  We have important directed fisheries for this stock and we do not see the scientific justification for such revision or for reduced catch and also a cut in the total allowable catch and quota around our coast.  We do not see the scientific advice which supports this cut as many of the stocks are in good order.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">Some €128 million has been allocated to the Forestry subhead for 2009, demonstrating the Government's commitment to maintaining an active and substantial forestry programme into the future.  This significant investment by the Government will allow for the operation of a range of forestry schemes next year.  However, much of the allocation for 2009 is already committed and the scope for new forestry schemes, or enhancements to existing ones, is limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">Given the substantial State investment in forestry over the last number of years I fully appreciate the need to manage the forest resource we have.  My Department has been promoting thinning and related wood energy initiatives over the last couple of years and I recognise the importance of forest roads to facilitate this.  Our officials are assessing how available resources can best be employed to meet the demands of industry for proper forest infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">Our officials recently met with the stakeholders in the forestry sector through the medium of the forestry liaison group.  They fully briefed them on the financial position for 2009 and the need for the prioritisation of programme expenditure.  The views of the stakeholders were sought on the areas of forestry activity where resources would best be employed and this will assist my Department in its examination of spending priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The overall forestry situation is currently being reviewed in light of the allocation under the 2009 budget to ensure the available funds are put to best use.  The allocation of funding to specific schemes will be on a basis of strict prioritisation of programmes in order to maximise the benefits for all the stakeholders within the forest industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_758">It is no good putting things on the long finger.  What reply can I give to the thousands of farmers who planted and put their faith in broadleaf plantations?  Their plantations take 40 or 50 years to come to maturity and are of immense significance for the country both economically and environmentally.  If the Minister of State wants to curb emissions that threaten us with a global disaster in the near future, he should start at his feet.  He should begin with the people who had the faith to plant plantations for the future of the country.  However, the Minister is putting these farmers on the long finger.  When will he introduce the revised forest road scheme that is urgently required to assist farmers to build the required forest roads infrastructure?  He has not answered that question.  Will he do so now?</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_759">I will try to elaborate further.  It is not telling tales out of school to say we sought more money so we could introduce the necessary schemes.  We did not get everything we wanted, but we got most of it.  The €128 million we got was considered good in the context of the situation with which we must deal.  Therefore, we had to prioritise.  The priority was to put the funds into the planting end of the business — the Deputy should be happy with that — because of the need for a greater amount of timber for the economic and environmental reasons to which the Deputy has alluded, sequestration of emissions being but one of them.  We also need a larger amount of timber to substitute for imports and for fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">With regard to fuel, there is now, more than ever, a market for thinnings, because of the wood pellet business and biomass yield and these provide revenue.  The calculation we have made is that as a result of the growing market and demand for thinnings, this should help in providing a level of infrastructure to support the market.  At the same time, we also need to increase plantings.  We had to take a strategic decision.  We hope and predict that the growing demand for thinnings will result in revenue that will help to offset the shortfall we have in the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">That may be a step in the right direction, but time is of importance.  How soon can the Minister of State establish a grant system for private foresters who have committed themselves to the future economy of the country?  When can he announce a package of grants for forestry roads for these private planters?</p>

I have already said that the available resources will determine when it will be possible to extend the revised forest road scheme.

It is not possible to say wait and see and the grant will come in due course.  I want people to take the decisions now and get the value of the thinnings and the improved value of the timber later, which will be enhanced if they thin at the right time.

The only outcome of that would be an increased sale of wheelbarrows, because we could not manage that without causing significant inflation.  We must be realistic.

            <p eId="para_773">Ireland has a very important position as custodian of some of the largest and richest fishing waters within the EU, but also in our location on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean.  Ireland continues to maintain high standards in the enforcement of regulations within the exclusive fisheries zone, using the resources of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The systems for dealing with infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy vary greatly from member state to member state and useful comparisons are not easily drawn.  Many continental legal systems are different from that of Ireland and lend themselves to an administrative fines and penalties structure.  Previous advice from the Attorney General in this regard indicated that under the Irish legal system, the types of penalties which Ireland is obliged to apply under the Common Fisheries Policy would be viewed as criminal in nature and, therefore, could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, the position is that all sanctions are purely financial in nature.  The Act simply sets down the maximum fines that may be applied.  No minimum fine is set and it is a matter for a judge, taking into account the specific case, to determine the fine levied.  The Act also applied for the first time a scaled approach to setting maximum fines whereby the maximum fines set for smaller vessels are less than for larger vessels.  In that respect, the 2006 Act sought to guarantee a degree of proportionality for fines, based on vessel size, a factor which did not exist in the previous legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">Administrative fines for fisheries offences could be introduced in Ireland if the infringements and appropriate sanctions were set down in European law.  I welcome new proposals which have been brought forward by the EU Commission with regard to introducing a new overall control regulatory framework.  These proposals will be examined carefully, including from a legal perspective, to consider if their provisions will support the introduction of administrative sanctions in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">We have always argued that control levels need to be raised across the European Union if we are to protect the future of stocks in all Community waters and fishing communities throughout the Community who are wholly dependent on those stocks.  It is clearly in the interests of the Irish fishing industry and fishing communities that there is strong and effective implementation of the quotas and other conservation measures on all fishing vessels fishing stocks in our zone.  I am committed to this in the interest of our fishermen and consequently welcome this proposal for a new control and inspection regulation, including efforts to introduce a harmonised system of sanctions.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food "when he will introduce administrative sanctions for minor fisheries offences here in view of the recent EU decision to implement administrative sanctions on a harmonised basis throughout Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter".</p>
            <p eId="para_795">While the Minister made a statement on the matter, I wish to raise the use of administrative sanctions in fisheries law.  Every country in the European Union has harmonised laws in respect of fishery offences, which are administrative, rather than criminal sanctions.  Ireland is the only country in Europe to introduce criminal sanctions against its fishermen and this is not in line with European law.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The Minister should take cognisance that the eminent lawyer and senior counsel, Dr. Gerard Hogan, appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food this morning to discuss the constitutionality of administrative sanctions which apply under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  His advice to the joint committee's members was that Ireland is not doing the right thing by criminalising its trawler skippers because they might have an additional box or two of monkfish or cod in their catch.  How can a trawler owner be responsible for whatever is in a net after two or three hours trawling?  In the efforts towards conservation, such an owner is supposed to dump the fish back into the sea because he or she could face a criminal charge were they to be landed.  What conservation efforts are served by dumping dead fish into the sea when half the world starves?  The Minister is on cloud nine when operating this law of criminalisation.  He is criminalising the trawler owners.  They have been criminalised for the past ten years and cannot even travel to the United States because they have a criminal indictment against their names.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">When will the Minister abide by the advice the joint committee received today from Dr. Gerard Hogan?  When will the Minister put in place the necessary legislation to make all fisheries offences administrative, rather than criminal in nature?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_799">This is not the first time I have heard Deputy Sheehan raise this issue at either the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or this Chamber.  I indicated in my reply:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_800">Previous advice from the Attorney General in this regard indicated that under the Irish legal system the types of penalties which Ireland is obliged to apply under the Common Fisheries Policy would be viewed as criminal in nature and, therefore, could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">It also is important to note "administrative fines for fisheries offences could be introduced in Ireland if the infringements and appropriate sanctions were set down in European law".  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and this issue was raised and discussed at length by Members in 2006.  At that time, the Attorney General's opinion, which has been reiterated subsequently, is that it was not possible.  I am sure the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will bring to my Department's attention the advice offered to it today by Dr. Hogan, who undoubtedly is a distinguished senior counsel.  One measure to be welcomed is that the European Commission has introduced a draft regulation on controls to be implemented by January 2010.  Naturally, the Government will seek the Attorney General's legal advice on this Commission proposal.</p>

          <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_457">
            <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_802">Does the Minister accept that a scheme of fixed penalty sanctions is not contrary to Ireland's obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy, as was alleged during the debate on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act?  Second, does he accept Ireland now is the only major maritime nation to rely exclusively on criminal penalties for policing fisheries offences?  Third, does he accept Ireland also is the only country in which gear and catch are forfeited as a mandatory statutory consequence in nearly every incidence of fisheries infraction, no matter how minor?</p>
            <p eId="para_803">Does he not then accept that there are ways to deal with this matter if the political will to so do existed?  There are two ways in which to deal with it.  The first is for Ireland to be part of an EU-wide regulation, whereby each EU member state is obligated to implement that EU regulation.  This approach should be pursued, although it might take some time.  The other way to deal with it is through the introduction of a fixed penalty approach, in a manner similar to the introduction of same in many other European countries and in the United Kingdom in particular.  This has been introduced in Scotland and is being introduced at present in Northern Ireland.  While taking into account the provisions of Article 37.1 of the Constitution, why is Ireland not following this approach?  It is the same basis on which fixed penalty fines have been introduced for minor and technical offences under the Road Traffic Acts, Local Government Acts and the Litter Pollution Act 1997; there is a clear precedent for so doing.  The Minister should confirm that he would look favourably on an argued approach that permits the introduction of such fixed penalty administrative fines in Ireland.  I always have argued that such fines are quite capable of being introduced under our Constitution.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">I refer to a point being made on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 in which it was stated that administrative sanctions would not be constitutional.

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_806">It was stated that it could not be done on advice from the Attorney General.  The advice received by the joint committee from Dr. Hogan completely and absolutely contradicts this position.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe made the point at the meeting that it depends on how one puts the question and I concur with this.  Members believe the question was put with a preconceived answer in mind.  For minor offences, sanctions can be introduced on a fines basis, or whatever is necessary, through amending the Act or through other measures to which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also has referred.  This issue must be revisited.  If there is sincerity and if the political will exists on the Government side of the House to deal with the issue, this can be done.  Obviously however, if such political will is lacking, it will not be done.  My point is the Government's bluff must be called in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_817">It is an important issue.  I will be meeting the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Borg, before the end of the week.

            <p eId="para_818">The European Commission has introduced a draft regulation on control to be implemented by January 2010.  The proposal provides for a penalty points system.  I reassure all Deputies who have contributed to this question that the proposal will be sent to the Attorney General's office for legal advice on the elements in it which set sanction levels for offences.  Naturally, we will report back to each of the individual Deputies who have been consistent in their representation and their articulation on this particular issue.</p>

Given the many calls on the funding available, my officials are assessing how available resources can best be employed to meet the demands of industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The Government has allocated €128 million to the forestry subhead for 2009.  The allocation demonstrates the commitment of the Government to a strong future for forestry in Ireland and will allow for the operation of forestry schemes next year. However, much of the allocation for 2009 is already committed and the scope for new forestry schemes, or enhancements to existing ones, is limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">My officials recently briefed the stakeholders in the forestry sector on the financial position for 2009 and the need for the prioritisation of programme expenditure.  The stakeholders highlighted the areas of forestry activity where they believed that resources would best be employed and this will assist my Department in its examination of spending priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Demand within the forestry sector for the introduction of a scheme for tending and first thinnings of broadleafs has been highlighted.  Unfortunately demand for all the forestry support schemes was quite high this year, relative to the funds available and it was not possible, therefore, to launch this scheme as originally intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The overall forestry situation is currently being reviewed in the light of the allocation under the 2009 budget to ensure the available funds are put to best use.  The allocation of funding to specific schemes will be on a basis of strict prioritisation of programmes in order to maximise the benefits for all the stakeholders within the forest industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">The deadline of 31 December 2008 for completion of work by farmers under the revised farm waste management scheme introduced by my Department in March 2006 is a condition of the EU state aid approval for the scheme.  The European Commission has since reaffirmed that it expects Ireland to respect this deadline strictly.  This has been made known to all farmers who have been approved to commence work under the scheme and I have urged farmers to ensure that such work is completed and a payment claim submitted to my Department before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">Where the farmer is unable to complete all the approved works before the deadline, grant-aid will be paid by my Department on separate and discrete units of work which are completed to the Department's technical specifications subject again to fulfilment of the conditions regarding the deadline set out above.  Full details regarding this matter were sent by the Department to all approved farmers under the scheme some time ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">I have confirmed previously on a number of occasions that there will be no extension to the deadline concerned.  The measures adopted in Northern Ireland in regard to its own scheme, which is substantially different to ours, are a matter for the authorities there.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">Is the Minister aware that in Northern Ireland this scheme has been extended by a number of months?</p>
            <p eId="para_847">In October last, 30,000 of the 42,000 applicants had proceeded and notified the Department that they were commencing work.  Obviously, there will be a number — let us not argue about its size — who will not proceed in any event.  However, there is a sizeable number of farmers who will not be compliant with the Nitrates Directive by virtue of the scheme deadline.  The future for them is either that they reduce their farming activities or they finance it out of their own resources, neither of which is viable in my opinion.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">The Minister must also take into account the significant employment that will be generated, in rural communities, in particular, in the construction sector.  According to the live register today, 17,000 additional persons went on the register in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Would the Minister please consider at this late stage extending the deadline by six months to enable the maximum number of applicants to complete those works and be compliant with the Nitrates Directive?</p>

Anyway, as somebody who posed the question, even though it is in the name of Deputy Liz McManus, I wish to put on record that I do not see why this is so, there is not any legal impediment and there is no European Union directive that states that the Minister cannot extend the deadline to allow for this scheme to be implemented.  The scheme is revenue neutral.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">I do not see why, if it can be done on one part of this island, it cannot be done on another part of this island.  It defies logic.  Farmers in the North are farming the same types of land as farmers in the South.  I cannot see the logic of the Government's position on this matter.  I do not see why the Minister cannot change his mind on it.  I ask the Minister to consider changing his mind on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_866">I can see no reason why the Minister cannot extend that scheme, for three months, if possible, to allow for the people who have encountered such savage weather conditions in the past 12 months.  They were hardly able to dig out the foundation for these improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">I would not mind but I believe that the Minister has not made an application to Brussels for an extension of the deadline of 31 December next.  If he has not, would he please do so immediately?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_870">I reiterate the need for an extension of the deadline similar to that afforded to the Six Counties, for three months.  I emphasise that there are many who will not get their buildings completed by that date.  Others cannot even get started because there is nobody available with the necessary qualifications to do that.  It is mind boggling to say that slurry spreading could be extended to 31 December by the Minister in the North, and again by the same Minister for another three months.  Maybe we need a Sinn Féin Minister on that side of the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_871">There is no merit in comparing the scheme in the three Ulster counties in this jurisdiction with the remaining 23 counties.  The scheme rolled out by the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North for its farming community is a scheme where grant aid is only applicable in respect of slurry storage capacity.  There was no element to include grant aid for housing, so it is not accurate to compare the schemes because they are not similar.  The level of grant aid is not as good in the North either.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">My understanding is that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland has not received express European Commission clearance for this procedure.  I also understand that the Department in the North will consider applications in exceptional circumstances, but it does not have a general extension to the scheme until 2 March.  When the Tánaiste, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, obtained State aid approval from the European Commission, the very arguments she made were about adverse weather conditions in early 2006.  Unfortunately for all of us, those adverse weather conditions have not improved.  In seeking a time derogation, our other argument was that there was not sufficient construction capacity in our economy and that there would be a huge scale of work to be undertaken when we launched a particular scheme.  These arguments got us the extension from March 2006 to the end of December 2008.  It has been an extremely successful scheme and the most generous granted-aided on-farm investment scheme.  The European Commission consistently repeated to us this year that it gave us an exceptional extension to the end of December 2008 and that we were obliged to adhere strictly to that particular condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Some months ago, following conversations with individual farmers and representations from colleagues in the Oireachtas, I found out that some farmers, for whatever reason, might not have completed the entire project for which they applied in 2006.  I introduced a specific measure to allow an individual applicant carry out part of the work, known as a discrete unit, within the overall plan and finish it according to the Department's specification.  The person who would work on an individual project within the overall scheme could draw down grant aid on that particular unit of the project.  Many individual farmers applied for substantial projects back in 2006.  Subsequently, they might not want to go ahead with the housing element of the scheme.  We issued approval to those people to finish specific units within the overall scheme, and that has facilitated many farmers throughout the country in doing the necessary work as they saw fit.</p>

Durkan — the urgent and pressing issue of mortgage supplement in the case of a person whom the HSE is only prepared to assist on a 50% basis as her mortgage is in joint names, but against whose husband there is a barring order, and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter; (7) Deputy Paul Connaughton — the matter of the installation of ducting for broadband purposes as part of the new sewerage and water treatment schemes for Tuam, County Galway; (8) Deputy Joan Burton — the underfunding of pension schemes in the private sector; (9) Deputy Seán Sherlock — the replacement of the weir in Fermoy and the flood alleviation works in the town; (10) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the provision of dental services in the Cork region for adults with an intellectual disability who require treatment under general anaesthetic; and (11) Deputy Jimmy Deenihan — the drastic effect that the education cuts recently announced in the budget will have on Scoil Mhuire na mBráithre, Christian Brothers primary school, Tralee, County Kerry, resulting in the loss of at least five teachers and the reduction of other services.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">In order to give proper protection to families on welfare and to ensure that they do not fall into the poverty trap, it is time to set a new, longer-term benchmark against which the evolution of social welfare payment rates can be measured.  An analysis should be undertaken to establish if a third of the average industrial wage is still sufficient to meet living expenses.  Many poverty groups agree with that and feel that new percentage is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">In spite of the Government's repeated claims of protecting the vulnerable, the reality is that vulnerable families are being neglected by the Government and put under significant additional pressure.  The president of St. Vincent de Paul, Ms Mairéad Bushnell, warned that 2009 promises to be the most difficult year in a generation for that organisation.  The proposed welfare increases are negated by the hike in the minimum contribution to rent and mortgage supplement, as well as by restrictions placed on families trying to access child benefit and the early childhood scheme.  Struggling families with children between five and six years of age could have up to €550 per annum taken from their budgets, while families with 18 year old children in education will lose up to €1,000 per annum from 2010.  The Government is damaging the working poor through the imposition of a 1% levy, while excluding families depending on welfare from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">There is further evidence that belies the Government's claim that it is protecting poor families.  The 1% income levy applies to people on anything above the minimum wage.  That should not be the case, as it should apply at the least to the threshold of the average industrial wage.  That might provide some semblance of fairness to those families who are struggling on very low incomes.  There is also evidence that the Government is not pressurising high-income families.  My next amendment calls for an abolition of the PRSI ceiling, which would have allowed a sufficient income stream to deal with increasing the 1% levy threshold.  The abolition of the PRSI ceiling would yield, at a conservative estimate, €295 million per annum to the Exchequer.  This shows that decisions could be taken by the Government which would alleviate the poverty and suffering of low income families.  I hope the Minister seriously considers accepting amendment No. 4.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_508">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_882">I support the concept of this amendment.  Targets were set in the programme for Government that will not be met, unless there are significant jumps in the rates of payment next year and the following two years.  The adequacy of payments are also linked to this amendment to some extent, when determining the benchmarks against which the rates can be measured.  The Government currently tends to rely on the overall inflation figure, rather than the issues that most affect people on social welfare.  Two of those issues are the dramatic rises in the cost of fuel and the rise in the cost of food.  I know fuel has come down somewhat in the past few weeks but people have not seen that everywhere as yet.  I hope the decreases in the price of diesel and other energy supplies will last but we do not know that they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">This year we have already seen electricity prices rise by 17.5%, gas prices by 20% and similar increases in home heating oil.  Such rises, along with the rise in the cost of fuel, are much higher than inflation and must be taken into account when assessing the value of social welfare payments.  They are not taken into account currently.  An interesting study was done by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, which we have quoted before on the energy poverty issue.  It published a study yesterday on people's options which reiterates what Age Action Ireland has stated, in that people will make the choice between heat or eat — fuel and food — in homes this winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Outlining figures as to what people are getting currently does not deal with the reality.  The institute's report links cost factors to the issue of fuel poverty — as well as obesity — because of the choices people are making as a consequence of the income they have.  This amendment relates to those issues and from that perspective, I support it.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_885">I do not propose to accept the amendment as no formal benchmark has been established because people could not agree on what it should be.  Targets have been set at various stages and these have been surpassed.  When the national anti-poverty strategy was being devised in 2002, the Government considered a report drawn up the previous year by the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group.  Despite the fact that no consensus was reached, the overall issue was the uprating of social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">In 2002, the group set as a target €150 per week for the lowest social welfare payments, with the target to be met by 2007.  This was achieved in that year and each year since the payments have increased again.  We still have our commitment in the programme for Government but the very first line in the programme indicates that what follows is dependent on economic conditions.  Such conditions have changed drastically but even for next year's budget we are still meeting the relative percentage agreement for the social welfare payment.  The increase will be 3.3% at a time when we expect what may be deflation next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I appreciate the Deputy's comments on the price of fuel and food, although the price of fuel has come down substantially.  I hope it will continue to do so.  The proof of the fact that Government payments have kept pace with need to some degree is in the report published today, the EU-SILC report.  Issues must still be resolved.  Deputies will be aware that we set as a target in the NAP reports a reduction in the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012.  Today's report shows us the consistent poverty rate has fallen from 6.5% in 2006 to 5.1% in 2007.  Real progress is being made in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Lone parents form another group that we know is particularly vulnerable and we have often talked about them here.  Figures show a reduction in consistent poverty for that group, from 33.9% to 20%, although it is still a very vulnerable group.  It is useful to see that the changes introduced by my predecessors, particularly in allowing lone parents to work for a certain number of hours and receive a certain income without affecting entitlements, has improved their position.  A related development is in the fall of the consistent poverty rate for children, down from 10.3% to 7.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">These are positive statements we can see from independent services which indicate that the payments and policies are working in combating consistent poverty.  The figure for those at risk of poverty is 16.5%, down from 17% the year before, although that is down from 19.7% in 2003.  Taking out the SSIA money from last year — even the CSO would acknowledge this as an aberration as there was much income last year that would not have been there in previous years — the risk of poverty goes down to 15.8%.  Those figures on the continuing decline in the poverty rates for 2007 demonstrate the Government's commitment and its success in combating poverty and building an inclusive society.  These will continue to be our aims.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">With regard to the rates we will put in for next year and the targets we will always aim to meet, notwithstanding the fact that we have serious economic considerations, we are reaching them but it is not possible to set a formal long-term benchmark.  We are at least meeting the aims we have set out.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_510">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_891">I support this amendment because it is important that targets are set in respect of social welfare payments and their adequacy.  I also put on record my concern about the manner in which this Bill is being dealt with and the restrictive nature of Standing Orders, particularly with regard to the Social Welfare Bill and Finance Bill.  There is an archaic ruling that we are not allowed to table amendments resulting in a charge on the Exchequer.  That has implications regarding this Bill, particularly this year because of the number of cuts contained in the legislation.  There is no facility whereby we, as Opposition spokespersons, can force a vote in respect of individual cuts proposed by the Minister.  That is completely unacceptable.  As I stated earlier, unless we go through the convoluted mechanism of looking for reports, we cannot force a vote on cuts here.  We did so on Committee Stage as we had the option of opposing sections but we do not have that choice on Report Stage.  It is absolutely farcical that the Dáil cannot vote on such critical issues as the list of cuts contained in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">In supporting the amendment looking for targets to be set, there is a need for such aims to be set across the full spectrum of social welfare payments.  Unless we set those targets and have some certainty about them, we will find ourselves again in the position we are in this year whereby the basic rates of social welfare payments in a number of different areas are being cut.  Not alone do we need targets in terms of the need to increase payments in line with inflation and other requirements, but we also must ensure that by setting targets we do not allow a case where the Minister of the day can carry out such cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">A range of cuts in this Bill is extremely regressive.  I referred earlier to the issue of part-time workers and how they will be affected by the Bill.  The Minister is looking for powers to change regulations relating to part-time workers, which will have a very negative effect on them.  The Minister has stated that she does not want a case to arise whereby a former part-time worker who finds himself or herself unemployed and drawing on jobseekers allowance would find himself or herself better off than when working.  That objective is fair enough but the Minister has gone much further than that in what she intends to do with regard to part-time workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Following this legislation, part-time workers earning up to €300 a week will be at a loss of approximately €44 per week if they find themselves unemployed.  In my calculations, even people working on the minimum wage up to 34 hours a week will still lose out to the tune of €44 per week with this measure.  The minimum wage for somebody working those hours falls short of €300.  It seems, therefore, that the €300 cut-off point is a very arbitrary figure.  It will end up with people on low incomes, even when they are working almost full time, being at a substantial loss.  I hope the Minister will accept the point I am making.  She indicated her intention and the reason for doing that, but the fact is that many people will lose out substantially.  It is a cruel cut for people who are on the margins, working for a minimum wage.  There is a list of about ten different cuts, of which the latter is the first.  I wish to discuss them all within the context of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I also wish to deal with cohabitation as it affects lone parents, which I discussed with the Minister on Committee Stage.  We should be setting targets in this area.  There are disincentives within the social welfare and tax systems against people on welfare or in low-paid employment forming two-parent families or getting married.  It is a bad policy to penalise financially two parents for living together or getting married.  That kind of policy cannot be defended, but unfortunately it is the reality for many lone parents.  They cannot contemplate living with their partner and children or getting married because of the manner in which the social welfare system discourages them from living together or penalises them for doing so.  Most couples in such scenarios — with both of them on welfare, one on welfare and one in a low-paid job, or two of them in low-paid jobs — stand to lose about 30% of their total income if they live together or get married.  The Minister should change that situation which is indefensible.  This matter was brought to the attention of the departmental officials a long time ago, but nothing has been done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">On Committee Stage, when I asked the Minister why promised proposals concerning changes to the status of lone parents had not been brought forward, she only referred to work.  While it is important to assist people in moving from the one-parent family payment into the workforce, the Minister has completely failed to address the issue of cohabitation.  What is her current thinking on the matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The Minister's predecessor, the late Séamus Brennan, recognised this as a key issue that needed to be tackled.  Since then, however, it seems that no progress has been made on it.  Nonetheless, it is central to the poverty trap and other difficulties that lone parents encounter.  There is probably nothing more fundamental for the children of lone parents than that both parents should be encouraged to play an active part in raising them.  As it currently operates, however, the system is telling unmarried fathers to keep away from their children and partner, because if they live in the family home they will be penalised financially.  That is a very bad policy.  Despite the fact that this major problem has been recognised for a long time, no progress has been made in tackling it.  It was obvious on Committee Stage that the Minister had not applied her mind to the matter.  I appeal to her to do so because the issue needs to be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I have already raised with the Minister the matters of guardianship and fostering.  The latter subject arose in the context of a case that was brought to my attention by Deputy Jack Wall.  It involved a couple who were fostering two children.  The man was working and the woman was at home minding the foster children.  However, the woman died and the man had to give up work to look after the two foster children.  In those circumstances, he was not entitled to a one-parent family payment.  If the man had a child of his own, he would have received that payment to cover his own child and the foster children.  The issue there was that the foster children did not constitute a qualifying child.  I have raised the matter with the Minister's officials and I understood that it would be dealt with in this legislation.  Indeed, the briefing suggested that changes were contained in the Bill that would enable the Minister to deal with such situations that, although quite unusual, are important and should be covered.  The Minister's comments on Committee Stage, however, indicated that she was not well disposed to dealing with the matter, so I am concerned about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The other issue is that of guardianship and my comments are based on a real life case I came across.  In circumstances where one parent is deceased and the other is incarcerated, there should be a provision whereby the couple's children would be regarded as being orphaned.  That does not apply at the moment, however, and the children of a remaining parent who is incarcerated are not regarded as being abandoned from the viewpoint of providing care and attention.  That is an anomaly that should be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The Minister should be clear about the parameters involved in applying the mortgage interest supplement.  I am concerned about the provision for the Minister to make regulations covering the payment of that supplement.  She has done that in respect of rent supplement and it has proven to be very restrictive.  I am concerned that under these new regulations the same kind of crude blunt instrument approach will be taken to the mortgage interest supplement.  For that reason, I am opposed to the measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The budgetary cuts proposed by the Minister for illness benefit and health and safety benefit are unacceptable.  The Minister will now require a doubling of contributions to qualify for both these payments, compared to what exists at present.  Both cuts are particularly swingeing and cruel for those who will be affected by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">One of the worst aspects of the budget concerned changes to the job seeker's benefit.  One would expect that targets would provide for an incremental improvement in the level of payments for various provisions within the social welfare code.  It is extraordinary, however, that the budget contained proposals that would end up with existing claimants for job seeker's benefit having their entitlements removed.  That is what the Minister is doing in this Bill but, as I said earlier, I think it will be subject to legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">It is difficult to envisage a situation where somebody is awarded a claim based on his or her insurance record, yet the Minister will cut three months off the duration of that claim.  I fail to see how that could stand up legally in terms of making retrospective provision.  The Minister is also proposing to introduce far-reaching cuts in the qualifying criteria for job seeker's benefit, the doubling of required contributions — 13 in the qualifying year — and the duration of the payment.  This is happening at a time when more and more people are coming onto the live register.  In the past year, 100,000 people have joined the live register.  They will look to the Government and, in particular, the Minister to provide them with the type of income that would enable them to survive in their new circumstances, but the Bill will make it more difficult for them to qualify for payments.  It is indefensible that, as more and more people look to the Government for assistance to tide them through a difficult phase, the Minister is turning the screw on them by making it more difficult and cutting the payment's duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Regarding income supports for children, targets must be set to encourage young people from disadvantaged families to remain in the education system, an issue with which the Minister is familiar since her previous experience in the Department of Education and Science.  Given this, it is difficult to understand why she would remove child benefit in respect of 18 year olds still in education.  I stated on Committee Stage that I did not accept her figures, but there is no doubt that this provision will have a significant negative impact on low income families struggling to keep sons and daughters in school until their leaving certificate examinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Under this legislation, child benefit payments will stop as soon as someone reaches 18 years of age.  Previously, it was paid up to the age of 19 years where young people remained in education.  This was of considerable assistance to 18 year olds remaining in school until their leaving certificate examinations.  I challenged the Minister's figures because, taking transition year into account, people now do eight years in primary school and six years in secondary school.  If they start school after four years of age, the majority will still be in school at 18 years of age.  I do not accept the Minister's figures, but even they would relate to a substantial number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">In the case of low income families, the payments make all the difference to young people who remain in school.  Indeed, the difference is €2,000 during a vital year in which families try to keep children in school until their leaving certificate examinations.  In many ways, the Minister has recognised the difficulty through the introduction of transitional payments, but she seems to be putting off the day when they will stop altogether.  When she was criticised in the context of the budget, she defended herself by saying that transitional payments would tide people over.  This situation will be fine for the next two years, but what will occur afterwards?  The child benefit payment will stop at the arbitrary age of 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I am prepared to stake money on this provision having considerable implications in the form of young people from low income families dropping out of school before they do their leaving certificate examinations.  School retention figures in disadvantaged areas are already poor, but this measure will further stress many young people.  The financial difficulties that it will create will pressure young people into leaving school to earn money.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I have a final point on the need to set targets.  We must move incrementally to reach them and ensure that payments are not subject to the whim of a particular Minister or the economic climate of the day.  We must ensure that social welfare incomes are protected.  For this reason, targets for improvements must be set.  It is taken for granted that the situation would not move backwards and payments would not be cut, but this is precisely what the Minister has done in the range of payments to which I have referred, including the early child care supplement.  It was introduced with great Government fanfare several years ago in recognition of the expense involved in having young children and their care, including where a parent must take time away from the workforce to care for children at home, which would entail financial sacrifices and a decrease in family incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The Minister has decided to wield the axe on the payment.  She has portrayed it as reducing the payment by six months, that is, from six years to five and a half years, but she is doing more.  Nine months are to be cut because, as well as stopping at five and a half years of age, a further three months will be lost by making it a monthly payment.  Families in receipt of the early child care supplement will lose €800.  This is difficult to justify, given the pressures experienced in those early years.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The Minister has agreed cuts with her Cabinet colleagues that will severely affect people's living standards.  Ironically, the changes in respect of part-time workers will come into effect on 25 December.  What a Christmas present to give to those on low incomes and facing unemployment.  From 25 December, they stand to lose €44 per week.  The other cuts will start to bite from January.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Since the Minister has failed to recognise the need to protect social welfare incomes and increase them incrementally on an annual basis and because she has reversed a number of provisions that were hard fought for over the years, people's incomes are being undermined at a time when more and more people are looking to her to protect them.  For all of these reasons, the budget is abhorrent.  The savage cuts will hurt families.  To support the amendment would be to agree to the setting of clear targets and to the rejection of the Government's regressive policy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_919">Deputy Shortall raised a number of points that I wish to address briefly.  There was a time when we had the luxury of a social insurance fund in surplus and there was more than sufficient income to cover the payments made from it each year.  Given that expenditure is likely to exceed the fund by €200 million this year and €900 million next year, it is important that we try to take some measures to ensure that we can continue to pay the unfortunate increasing demands on the fund.  Arising from this factor, we made changes to eligibility requirements, particularly in the jobseekers' scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Regarding part-time workers, it is a solid principle that there should be a link between the amount of money one gets at work and the amount one gets in welfare to the effect that one should not get more on welfare than one gets at work.  It is also important that nothing in the social welfare system should act as a disincentive to people to return to work.  The change was introduced for this reason.  The same situation obtains in respect of how long people spend working and the lengths of time during which they can benefit from their work.  For example, migrants and young workers who have only spent a short time in the workforce should not be able to benefit for too long from whatever payments they have made.  These are strong principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">While I have mentioned the figures detailing the decrease in consistent poverty rates among lone parents, they remain the most vulnerable group and their children are those most vulnerable to the risk of poverty.  My predecessors have considered this matter and relevant proposals are being worked on.  I had the pleasure to meet representatives of groups such as OPEN and One Family, who provided valuable suggestions, advice and research findings in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">I fully accept that there are aspects of the social welfare system which militate against lone parents forming long-term relationships, marrying or obtaining well-paid jobs.  Our rules on cohabitation militate against long-term relationships.  That is not in the best interests of children, nor does it facilitate family formation.  Our rules relating to work seem to encourage lone parents to obtain employment, be it full-time or part-time in nature.  The figures released earlier indicate that their incomes have improved.  However, there is no great incentive for them to make the leap into better paid jobs.  As one lone parent informed me last week, she hates January because she receives an increase.  The individual in question is almost inclined to ask her employer not to give her the increase because of the knock-on effects it can have in respect of the benefits she receives.  I appreciate that she does not want to lose out.  These are the major issues and our thinking in respect of them has progressed in the 12 months since the original proposals were published.  Various groups and lone parents themselves have offered useful comments on how they have been affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Deputy Shortall also referred to guardianship, fostering, etc.  The foster care allowance is extremely generous.  People who foster children offer a very valuable service.  Fostering is greatly preferable to having children placed in residential care.  During my time as Minister of State with responsibility for children, the allowance was substantially increased.  If the two children in the case to which the Deputy referred are over 12, then the parent in question is receiving €678 per week in respect of them.  That is a reasonable amount of money.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">On child benefit, figures from the central database of the Department of Education and Science show that 72% of young people who completed the leaving certificate last year were under the age of 18.  Whereas the majority of schools offer a transition year, the majority of students do not take up this offer.  A number of schools only offer transition year to a limited number of students in the relevant cohort.  Considerations relating to child benefit should not in any way act as a deterrent in the context of people continuing with their education up to leaving certificate level.  We introduced compensatory payments for next year and the year after as a result of the suddenness of the change, which takes effect from 1 January.  We do not want to cause people any further undue distress by removing the payment without giving adequate notice.</p>

When the scheme was introduced — I am not stating that this was the correct way to proceed — a person could effectively be paid the allowance in respect of a child that had not yet been born.  If one's child was due to be born in March, one received payment from the beginning of January.  The Deputy cannot be seriously suggesting that people are losing out in this regard.</p>

However, the scheme will still cater for the needs of children in the age category — from birth to five and a half years of age — at which it is targeted.  These children are of preschool age.  Payment will no longer be made in respect of the couple of months before they are born or the six months after they reach five and a half years of age.  All cuts are difficult but the payment will still be made to those in the target group.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">Deputy Shortall ignored the increases that were introduced in the budget.  The Department's own budget for next year will be €19.6 billion, an increase of 15.5% on the figure for last year.  We are aware of the pressures that will come to bear, particularly in the context of the live register and the unfortunate situation in which people are finding themselves.  The rise in the numbers on the live register will alone account for €1.25 billion of the planned increase for next year.  Notwithstanding the terrible economic pressures and financial difficulties that exist, the budget included an amount of €515 million in respect of increases in social welfare rates for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">It will, at all times, remain our aim to try to give as much as possible to as many people as possible who are dependent on social welfare payments.  In light of the changed economic circumstances, however, we have been obliged to ensure that there is a relationship between the number of hours people work and the amount they receive in social welfare payments in order to ensure that the social insurance fund will remain capable of meeting the demands placed upon it.  We will continue our efforts in respect of policy issues relating to lone parents, the carer's strategy, etc.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_943">I wish to acknowledge the comments made by Deputies Enright and Shortall.  In the first instance, I must state that it is a question of choices.  There is no doubt that the welfare to work process is riddled with bottlenecks and these need to be removed.  Vision and imagination are required in this regard but, to date, the Government has not demonstrated these qualities in abundance.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">The amendment tries to deal with the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the adequacy of payments.  The latter dictates whether families live in poverty or otherwise.  Again, it is a matter of choices.  The Government should introduce a benchmark and this should relate to what are the relevant economic conditions at any given time.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House are aware that some combination of the three parties in opposition may well occupy the Government benches in the medium term.  If that eventuality came to pass, we would be tasked with making choices and with implementing provisions similar to those contained in the amendments we are moving.  This is not a political game.  We are trying to address the increase of poverty in society.  We face a significant challenge in that regard, particularly in the aftermath of the economic downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Minister has not accepted any amendments thus far and there is no indication that she will accept any of those that will be moved later.  That is extremely regrettable.  Some of us on the Opposition benches may well be called upon to introduce measures based on these amendments in the future.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that notion, sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">I do not wish to discuss the issues to which Deputy Shortall referred because I will have the opportunity to do so in respect of later amendments.  In defending certain aspects of her strategy, the Minister referred to a survey in respect of which she released a press statement earlier today.  I will be obliged to examine the matter in greater detail but I accept certain of the findings, particularly those relating to lone parents, etc., contained in the survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The important aspect of amendment No. 4 is that it calls for a complete review in respect of all social welfare categories.  Another report published today did not merit a mention in the Minister's press release.  This report relates to older people and shows that the number of them at risk of poverty has risen substantially in the past year.  In 2006, 13.6% of those over 65 years of age were at risk of poverty, whereas in 2007 this rose to 16.6%.  The figure relating to older people living alone rose from 19.3% in 2006 to 24.3% in 2007, an increase of 5%.  If those figures are accurate, that is a worrying increase.  More importantly, it shows the Government's lack of grasp in this regard.  As a result of some of the decisions made in the budget — the decision regarding medical cards comes immediately to mind — people are aware the Government is not meeting targets in terms of our over 65s who are living in poverty.  We can all be selective about what we choose to discuss.  However, that is the reality of the findings.  Age Action Ireland issued a press release today regarding its concerns on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Deputy Morgan's amendment provides us with an opportunity to set clear targets rather than simply produce report after report or action plan after action plan.  Whenever we table parliamentary questions in respect of these reports or plans, we discover their aims are never reached anyway.</p>

          <p eId="para_950">I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  On the issue of setting targets or benchmarks, will the Minister state how, in the absence of setting benchmarks, the adequacy of social welfare payments will be assessed?  The Minister might also respond to a number of the issues I raised earlier, in particular, the position in respect of part-time workers.  While acknowledging the so-called anomaly identified by the Minister, why is she going so much further than that?  Does the Minister accept my criticism in regard to what she is proposing in terms of setting the bar at €300?</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I raised specifically with the Minister the issue of cohabitation, which she ignored and spoke only about work.  I am asking the Minister, for the third time, what is her thinking in respect of cohabitation and does she intend addressing this issue in the near future?  Also, the Minister referred in her budget speech to making regulations covering mortgage interest supplement.  Why is she doing this and what is she trying to achieve?</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1108">Thank you.  This amendment arises out of Committee Stage and I understand all Members received representations from FLAC in respect of it.  FLAC is concerned about the operation of the rent supplement and the mortgage interest supplement especially as the current appeal procedure is overly cumbersome and can result in lengthy delays.  It is a three-stage appeal system whereby if a person applies to a community welfare officer for a mortgage interest supplement and is turned down, he or she can then appeal the application to the HSE and following that stage has another opportunity to appeal it to the chief appeals officer of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but the difficulty is that the person must submit the appeal application to the HSE and then the papers are relayed to the chief appeals officer.  Experience of the appeals process indicates there are quite lengthy delays at the level of the HSE and, in some cases, rather than referring the appeal to the chief appeals officer of the Department, the HSE sends the papers back to the superintendent community welfare officer for that officer's views.  In one case that was brought to my attention there was a delay of approximately 20 weeks before the papers were passed on to the chief appeals officer.  The current position is unacceptable.  It seems to be overly bureaucratic, cumbersome and subject to delays.  The whole system should be streamlined and the application for the final stage of an appeal should go to the chief appeals officer, as happens in the case of social welfare claims that have been refused.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1109">I support this important amendment.  I read with interest the submission made by FLAC in regard to it.  I tabled questions to the Minister on the issue after Committee Stage last week because there was not much concrete information on the operation of the mortgage interest supplement.  One of the interesting things I discovered is that there are no statistics on the number of people who applied or were refused this supplement unless the case went to appeal.  It is difficult to assess the adequacy of any figures given in the Estimates if we do not even know the number of people who have sought the mortgage interest supplement.  Nobody looks for a mortgage interest supplement unless they cannot meet their mortgage.  It is important that we examine the overall operation of the mortgage interest supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">The timeframe of appeals has also been brought to my attention.  The replies I received from the Minister indicated that the average duration of a supplementary welfare allowance appeal last year was eight weeks, while the average duration of appeals in general was 22 weeks.  It is not clear under which category the mortgage interest supplement comes, whether it is the overall figure or the figure for supplementary welfare allowance appeals.  According to FLAC there are considerable difficulties in that regard.  It would be worthwhile if changes were made to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">As of 21 November 2008, some 7,347 people were in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of, 3,236 people, more than 80%, compared to this time last year.  In many instances more people are affected as families are involved.  Bearing in mind the amount allocated for mortgage interest supplements in the budget, I am extremely concerned about the sufficiency of the amount provided in the Estimates and I intend to raise the matter next week during the select committee's discussion of the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I am sure colleagues have a similar experience of being inundated with people coming to them, sadly, many of whom have been refused mortgage interest supplement, but who still need it.  The criteria for qualification need to be changed because community welfare officers are deciding off their own bat, due to the way the regulations are framed, that they will not help if they deem a person's mortgage to be too high.  It is for the very reason that the mortgage is too high that people cannot pay it in the first place.  That area must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Unfortunately, amendments must be tabled in such a way that they do not impose a potential charge on the Exchequer, which means we cannot call for an increase in the amount allocated.  I made the point last week, and it is important to reiterate it, that if people's homes are repossessed they will still cost the State money.  Such people will probably cost the State more money because they will get rent supplement after the obligatory qualification period and many people will go back on local authority housing lists.  While it will not be the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who pays for those houses — it will be another Department — it will still cost the Exchequer.  It makes far more sense to support people to stay in their homes and the supplement needs to be examined in order to achieve that end.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_552">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1114">I support the amendment and commend Deputy Shortall for tabling it.  Everybody in the House recognises that there has been a significant increase in the number of people seeking representation and assistance with their appeals.  Given the economic change we are experiencing, I expect those numbers will grow.  The difficulty of delays in the appeals process causes huge trauma and concern to the householders involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">In trying to deal with those cases, it is important that we have a publicity campaign to encourage mortgage holders who find themselves in difficulty to talk to their lending agent, be it a bank or building society, because by negotiating with the lender at least they will hopefully stave off the process of foreclosure.  We already see a substantial increase in the number of applications by one particular lending agent against householders.  I look forward to judges in the High Court taking a constructive view of that process because in some cases mortgages were given out by lending agents that had no prospect of being paid given the age and income of the mortgage applicant.  That is disgraceful.  It is important that the lending agencies carry their share of responsibility in terms of a mortgage holder's ability to repay a mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">A couple of weeks ago I received a representation from a man who secured a substantial mortgage at the age of 50 for a 20-year period for in excess of €100,000.  He would have to work until he is 70 to repay it, but the lending institution is foreclosing on him and he will lose his home.  That is ridiculous.  I do not believe he should lose his home.  It is a pity he did not have better legal representation because the case could have been made that the High Court should not have found in favour of the lender.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Given the economic situation, it is clear there will be an ever-increasing number of applicants for mortgage interest supplements.  I hope the Minister can find some pathway to resolving the lengthy delay in the process and to iron out the bottlenecks because they are causing huge concern.  That will affect all of us, as well as our constituents, to an increasing extent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_553">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1118">I concur with the sentiments expressed by the previous speakers.  Appeals, supplementary welfare and qualification criteria for payments, whether they be supplementary welfare payments or social welfare payments, are sensitive areas.  We must remember that circumstances are vastly different from two or three years ago.  Many people are between a rock and a hard place and find themselves in a desperate situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">In recent days I dealt with the case of a person who had been made redundant due to the recession.  The person concerned has a mortgage and all the responsibilities that go with it.  He signed on and was paid unemployment assistance.  He forgot to sign on a month later, as has happened in more than one case, and, unfortunately, he gave the wrong answers in a questionnaire and payment was terminated completely.  When I met the person concerned, he was desperate, very emotional and needed help urgently.  I tabled the usual parliamentary question, which from past experience we know is usually accepted as an appeal in this type of case.  I was given a long lecture about the procedure that has to be gone through.  It is too late for that long procedure.  In the difficult situation in which we find ourselves, especially when people feel under stress and are likely to become more stressed, it is important that the agents of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive recognise that and apply it in how they deal with cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Another example that is relevant to the amendment is the case of a woman and her husband who have a mortgage.  He turned out to have an addiction problem and ended up in prison, leaving a substantial mortgage to be paid, which goes to show what our society is like at present.  The issue affects everybody, right across the spectrum.  The result is that the woman in question gets only half the usual mortgage support because her husband who is now incarcerated has an interest in the house.  The theory is that it would be wrong for the State to support any part of his interests.  What difference does it make?  After all, if she loses the house the State will have to support her interests and his interests at a later stage because we do not know what will be the outcome.  There is no necessity to go that route at all.  There is a tendency to apply the poor law attitude at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">That stems from a fear in the Department that it will run out of money before the end of the year.  The Estimate for the Department of Social and Family Affairs is dramatically short of what will be required, and this will become manifest over the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">I support the points made by all the other speakers.  It is critical that the Minister consider our points and ask that the officials at the coalface dealing with the kinds of individuals described do so sensitively.  The festive season can be a time of relief or despair and we need to be very careful not to allow despair to prevail at this time.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_554">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_1123">I support the Deputies who have spoken already, particularly Deputy Olwyn Enright.  It is very difficult to formulate policy at present.  I sympathise with the Government in respect of the difficulty it will face in targeting limited resources at areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">The issue of house repossession will rise up the agenda very rapidly.  In this regard, it is difficult to balance the evidence and make decisions because much of the evidence is anecdotal.  I was talking to a constituent last night and asked her how her family was doing.  She said that they were grand and that her two girls and their husbands were working, all in the same plant.  The same plant is at risk at present.  The four family members in question, who are decent people, have their own houses and big mortgages and they could all go down together in the next 12 months.  Public representatives are familiar with constituents' incomes and are noting them all the time when they come to us for assistance.  We note that many young couples would not last a month if they lost their jobs because their mortgage repayments are so high.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">Let me recount more anecdotal evidence.  I met somebody last week who told me the lending institutions were holding off on foreclosure until after Christmas.  She was in a business in which she should know this.  I was informed that the lending institutions have a list of very difficult cases on their books but are not making any approaches to the courts until after Christmas.  However, as soon as the Christmas period is over, they will start filing.  A significant number of people will be at risk of losing their homes once January comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The Queen's speech took place today in the House of Commons.  The British Prime Minister was explaining it afterwards and stated he will be introducing new measures to protect people at risk of losing their homes.  The headline announcement seemed to refer to a deferral of foreclosure proceedings in all circumstances for six months to allow mortgage holders negotiate with their lending institutions, in the manner advised by Deputy Morgan.  However, a second proposal, which sounded reasonable to me, was also made.  It was suggested that, where people are at risk, the British Government will be prepared to underpin mortgage repayments for a two-year period.  I do not know the mechanism because the detail was not explained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">When the Minister has a little more time over the Christmas recess and is not under the pressure she is under now as a member of the Government, in respect of which I sympathise with her, she might consider a proposal along the lines of those made in the United Kingdom with a view to prioritising the cases of the young, skilled people who have very large mortgages and who are at risk of losing their jobs and homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The phenomenon we are witnessing will be temporary if circumstances improve.  If mortgage holders' mortgages could be underpinned for a year and a half or two years, they might work their way through the problem.  They might be able to organise longer-term mortgages subsequently to indemnify the State against any loss incurred.  We do not want the courts full of repossession orders in the first three months of the year, with the problem getting worse as the year progresses.  Losing one's job is bad but if the immediate consequence of this is losing one's home, it is a crisis.  Measures are necessary to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">I welcome the amendment.  My proposals are not fully covered by it but it is important and will be very helpful also.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_555" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1130">Having seen today the number of people who have joined the live register, we realise this is an extremely difficult time.  As Deputies stated, it is not just a question of losing one's job because many are in danger of losing their homes also.  The State is in a position to support many of them with rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The increase in the unemployment rate over recent months indicates the difficulty people are experiencing.  At the end of October, during which month I have no doubt there was a significant increase, 7,000 people were in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement.  As we know, there were considerable numbers availing of the rent supplement.  The allocation for this year could in no way meet the demand that arose.  Our provisional estimate for the mortgage interest supplement was €14.4 million but we now anticipate we will spend €26 million thereon this year.  A provision of €31 million has been made for next year.  As more people qualify over the coming years — it is a demand-led scheme — we will have to keep the allocation under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">It is true to say the same financial institutions that offered 100% mortgages without demanding a deposit and which in most cases carried out very few checks as to ability to pay are the very institutions that are threatening to foreclose.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has advised me that one of the major problems associated with those who seek its advice is that they have not approached any of the financial institutions to determine whether they could restructure their repayments.  People are overtaken by fear and a sense of insecurity.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service told me the hall table was the most popular place in the house in that people leave their post there without even opening it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">We want to encourage people who are facing difficulties and losing their jobs to go to their financial institution to discuss the restructuring of repayments.  If somebody has a good record of making repayments, there is no a reason financial institution should repossess his or her home or penalise him or her, despite the fact that he or she may have lost their job.  We all hope circumstances will improve.  There is nothing worse than losing one's home after losing one's job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">What Deputy Noonan said about developments in the United Kingdom is very interesting.  I will consider any suggestions that might support mortgage holders.  Our mortgage interest supplement does just that — it supports the interest payment.  Mortgage holders who are experiencing difficulty should approach their financial institutions and the latter should be as willing to engage with them as they were to hand out the money in the first instance.  From our own budgeting perspective, we will be considering the needs for next year.  I refer to the mortgage interest supplement, not to mention rental supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">With regard to the amendment, I appreciate the position of Deputy Shortall.  The difficulty concerns the way in which the system is currently devised in that social welfare money is being paid out by community welfare officers who are employed by the Health Service Executive.  This is why the system is as it is.  The Deputy will also be aware it is proposed that the community welfare officers will come under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As part of this measure, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 provides that the appeals process for basic supplementary welfare allowance payments, including the mortgage interest supplement, will be integrated with the appeals procedure for other social welfare payments.  Thus, the system will become much more streamlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">The legislative provision is not yet in force but, as soon as the transfer of functions regarding the supplementary welfare allowance from the Health Service Executive to the Department is complete, we will activate it.  It should serve to meet the concerns being raised about the process and procedures, as they currently exist.  It is for this reason that I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_556">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1137">I agree with the Minister that there is a need for financial institutions to be flexible, particularly in the case of those who were very much encouraged to stretch themselves to the limit in their borrowing and who, in some cases, were advised to overstate their income.  I will address those issues later because I have tabled amendments dealing with people who find themselves in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">The Minister will know that at the weekend the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, proposed a moratorium on home repossessions.  People who find themselves in that very difficult situation, having lost their jobs and in danger of losing their homes, must be given some breathing space.  That must be given to them by the financial institutions involved but also by the Government, particularly in respect of the supplementary welfare system and how it operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">It is not in anybody's interest that a person should lose his or her home.  That is why there is need for flexibility on the Minister's part as well as on the part of the banks and building societies.  One would hope that many of these people are in a temporary difficulty regarding loss of employment and that, in time, they will find their way back into the workforce and be able to get their affairs in order.  They must be assisted over that hump when their income suddenly stops and they struggle to make repayments.  Flexibility is critical in this regard.  One must also bear in mind what will happen those people if such flexibility is not shown, by the financial institutions or by the State.  In those circumstances, the likelihood is that the person will lose his or her home and will come to the State looking for assistance in the form of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">There is a very lengthy and expensive process for the financial institutions involved in repossession and, ultimately, the banks and building societies end up with properties they do not want.  The previous property owners come back to the State looking for assistance.  It makes sense to offer that kind of breathing space for people, whereby the State, as well as the financial institutions, provide the flexibility required.</p>

          <p eId="para_1142">This amendment relates specifically to the issue of appealing decisions in respect of supplementary welfare.  There are issues of natural justice involved at present and the Minister must address these.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_559">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1143">My party leader has also dealt with the need for a moratorium.  It is important that the Government gives it urgent consideration.  At this point, people are caught in the middle with foreclosure actions already in the courts.  They do not have time on their side because decisions will be taken once the actions reach the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The Minister spoke about the letter on the hall table and people afraid to open it.  That is the case.  Such people go to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and by that very action they face up to the situation.  They go to that organisation in order to deal with the fact they have a problem.  It must be recognised there are people who do not have the financial coping skills to deal with the situation.  That is the reason MABS is so important and it is why they go there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The Minister mentioned MABS.  Referring to the first half of 2008, the organisation said at that stage that it had seen a 57% increase in its clients.  The figure is now 80%.  It also saw a corresponding increase in people being refused mortgage interest supplement.  We might say that some people have their heads in the sand because they are afraid to open their letters but the Government also has its head in the sand concerning the seriousness of this matter.  It thinks all will be fine if these people talk to MABS.  That is not sufficient.  They might negotiate with the financial institutions but even when they are able to reach a deal, it might well depend on whether they can get the mortgage interest supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The Minister must see that a holistic approach is necessary.  Often when the banks help people it is only on the basis that they will get the supplementary welfare allowance to help them make some progress in paying the mortgage.  There will be people for whom it is not a case of either-or.  It must be a degree of both.  The Minister must look at the adequacy of this approach and she must require her Department, as a matter of urgency, to examine who is being refused and why that is the case.  Dealing on a one-off basis with individual appeals is one thing but there is clearly a problem in the overall system.  People with high mortgages are being refused and will lose their homes as a result.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_560">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Minister has indicated she does not intend to accept the amendment.  If that remains her position, will she consider going to the Minister for Finance and asking him whether, as part of the scheme we have for relevant banks in this State, he would require them not to foreclose on householders who are making a genuine effort to pay?  Further, would he ask them to negotiate with mortgage holders who find themselves in some difficulty?  The banks should not demand an interest-only repayment because that leaves the bulk of the capital sum still at large, but rather a mortgage-only repayment.  The interest would be effectively suspended for a period of perhaps two years, or for whatever period remains of the scheme for the banks.  Does the Minister consider such fundamental public policy relevant enough that she would bring such a case to the Minister for Finance and ask him to apply it to the banks?  There is no doubt that the Minister for Finance has the power to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Nobody is defending people who are reckless with their mortgages and I accept there will always be such people.  I gave the example earlier of a 50 year old man, who should have known better, taking out a very substantial mortgage for a 20-year period.  That is not to say we wish to see such people losing their homes.  We certainly do not.  A strong case can be made that we are in very difficult circumstances and we should not make matters worse.  I believe the Minister would accept that.  The public need leadership and thinking outside the box.  I hope that in these exceptional circumstances the Minister might consider going to the Minister for Finance with such a proposal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1149">I will not accept the amendment because there are already powers in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 to provide a more streamlined appeal mechanism once the transfer takes place between the community welfare officers in the HSE and my own Department.  I believe that will address the need.  In the meantime I will try to ensure that times are not unduly long for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">In view of the demands made on the mortgage interest supplement and the rent supplement, it is my intention to try to keep this situation under review, with regard to the amounts in question and the qualifying criteria.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_562">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1151">I accept what the Minister said about functions transferring to the Department and the issue being dealt with in that respect.  I am concerned about it.  The issue is not just that there are delays in the appeals system but that there are definite issues of natural justice involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The HSE decides the first round appeal.  If the appellant must submit a request for the second-level appeal and accompanying papers, that appellant is put at a disadvantage when compared to the HSE, the paying body in the case.  Very often in those circumstances, the HSE sits on the appeal papers and has additional time in which to consider its case and to strengthen and consolidate it.  We have seen cases of this.  In very many cases of which the Free Legal Advice Centre is aware, the HSE sends the papers back to the superintendent community welfare officer requesting further grounds on which to refuse the appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">On the grounds of natural justice that is unacceptable.  It is an unfair situation and places the appellant at a very real disadvantage. The first-level appeal has already been decided and it should be left at that in order that the second appeal can be taken to another body.  The obvious solution is that the application for that appeal should go to the chief appeals officer.  There is no reason that the Minister cannot change that system now.  It would be very easy to do it because a simple regulation would suffice.  It could be set up and those anomalies with regard to the right to fair procedures, which clearly exist at present, could be removed.  I ask the Minister to consider, in advance of the functions being transferred from the community welfare officers to the Department, putting in place that fairer system, as requested by FLAC.</p>

          <p eId="para_1293">This amendment, which relates to the family income supplement, is one of those classic amendments we must table because we are not permitted to raise the issue any other way.  I agree with what my colleagues said about the farcical way we have to go about tabling amendments on the social welfare Bill, that it makes no sense and makes the House look antiquated.  Generally the Government has the numbers, even if it has lost a few in the past few weeks, to get its votes through.  The fact we cannot table and discuss amendments on particular issues does no service to the House or democracy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1295">I appreciate the Minister has a report due on family income supplement, but it was due to be completed in July 2008 and it is now 3 December.  When will the report be published?  I am aware of the objectives of the report as a result of a reply to a parliamentary question, but I am concerned about the numbers involved.  Currently, some 26,000 families are in receipt of family income supplement.  In 2007, the Department received almost 37,000 family income supplement claims, which was an increase of approximately 4,000 on the previous year and an increase of 10,000 from 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The numbers receiving the supplement are 10,000 fewer than the number of applicants.  While it is obvious that everyone who applies for the supplement will not be eligible for it, there is a lack of clarity for applicants with regard to the income limits applicable to those receiving family income supplement.  We have all mentioned in the past that there is a poor take-up of the supplement and I am aware the expected report deals with this.  However, it is strange that a substantial number of those who apply, almost one third of applicants, are found not eligible for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">With regard to the importance of the supplement, earlier this week the Society of St. Vincent de Paul highlighted the significant numbers of those in need this year.  It expects to have to spend €50 million this year to help people in need and urgently needs €10 million to meet the extra demands on it.  It is worrying that this time last year the society had already noticed a sea change, in that people who had been contributors to the society were suddenly the people ringing looking for help.  This is a major concern.  Currently, two out of every three calls to the society are from families with children and more than one in four calls are from people who never previously used the service.  This gives us an indication of the seriousness of the difficulties in which people find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The society gave figures for the number of calls for help it received in the first nine months of this year.  The situation is even more serious now.  The calls were up 37% in Dublin, 36% in Cork and 30% in the mid-west.  Most other areas are also under significant pressure.  The society is a voluntary organisation that runs on donations from the public through box and mass collections, etc., and it fills a void in the social welfare system.  I appreciate the budget can never cover everything, but the family income supplement must be examined.  I welcome the fact the report is to be published, but we have been waiting and waiting for it.  I would like to see it published by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">It is a pity that before we come to deal with the social welfare Bill we do not have the opportunity to see such reports, no more than on the issue of lone parents.  This brings us back to the point about independence.  The Opposition should have the opportunity to look at and examine such reports so we do not need to rely on other organisations for information that the Government has researched itself.  We should have the reports that have been published or made available to the Government on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">Families are stretched beyond their capacity.  The other areas we have discussed, such as mortgage relief and so on, verify this.  The family income supplement needs to be examined because the provisions of budget 2009 will not make a great deal of difference for many families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1301">I support this amendment.  Family income supplement is a welfare-to-work mechanism that can offer families an opportunity to return to work.  However, the difficulty pertains to the thresholds involved because they often are not sufficient.  I agree with the previous speaker that it is a very useful tool and recipients of family income supplement, FIS, are a category of people with whom many Members are familiar because they deal frequently with such constituents.  At the least this matter should be reviewed and the Minister should accept this amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_567" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">

          <p eId="para_1302">I do not propose to accept the amendment because this research, which will help to guide future policy, will become available.  The Government is aware that not everyone who is entitled to the family income supplement avails of it.  However, it has not been possible to ascertain from administrative sources the exact numbers of people who do not apply.  There are also a number of reasons people might not apply for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">Members will be aware that in next year's budget, the Government anticipates a further 2,000 families will benefit from the supplement.  It constitutes a substantial sum at present and is an aspect of my Department's budget that has increased in recent years.  The amount being spent currently is €181 million, which constitutes a fivefold increase.  The supplement is targeted in the main at people with large families and tries to support low income families with children.  I understand the research is nearing completion and while I do not know the exact date on which I will have it, it will be valuable and will allow my Department to examine how more families can be supported.  That is the reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1304">The Minister stated that a number of families have reasons for not applying for this supplement.  She should outline such reasons to the House because it is unusual for people who are eligible for something not to apply, unless they would lose something else as a result.  That is the only logical reason I can discern for such a failure to apply.  I acknowledge the Department's IT systems may vary in respect of local area offices and so on.  However, it is difficult to understand the reason a system cannot be evolved in respect of those who make applications for other payments.  The Department has the PPS numbers of all social welfare recipients and even if it is unable to state definitely that a person is eligible for family income supplement, it should be able to at least inform them that they may be eligible for such a payment.  Consequently, people at least would be aware of its existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">While people are becoming more conscious of its availability, it is somewhat like the mortgage interest supplement, the existence of which some people also are unaware.  Such a system should be evolved rather than being obliged to engage in expensive advertising and so on, which does not always target those who are most at risk or who need the supplement or who are eligible for it.  There must be a method by which people can be made more aware of the supplement through their regular dealings with the Department within the social welfare system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1306">The research that has been undertaken by the Department is attempting to ascertain the current level of take-up among those who would qualify for FIS, as well as the reasons they are not availing of it.  This will help the Department to determine future policy in this regard.  However, the biggest increase in applications arose from a nationwide awareness campaign in 2006.  While there were also changes in thresholds at that time, awareness was a factor.  Members also have done their best to make people aware of it through budget leaflets, etc.  As I found myself, however, it is very difficult to explain on a leaflet and people need further information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">In addition, issues continually arise in respect of sharing data, even between Departments or with Revenue and so on.  However, once this research becomes available, which can identify the reason people have not applied for it, my Department will be able to target it more specifically.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1317">"6.—This section shall allow for the abolition of the current PRSI ceiling and will come into operation on 1 January 2009.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">I have been making the point for some time that this budget presented the Government with an opportunity to make choices.  In respect of poverty issues, it could decide that both low income and middle income families are supported.  When I was first elected, Members used to discuss low income families.  However, what used to be middle income families effectively now have become low income families, particularly when in receipt of a single income.  For example, I refer to a household comprising a couple with three children and a substantial mortgage on a single income of €50,000 or marginally in excess of that sum.  While such a case would be regarded as a middle income family, the people involved are liable to experience hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">The Government did not make the correct choices.  While I have addressed this area previously in respect of an earlier amendment and I am reluctant to go over it again, had the Government chosen to remove the ceiling, as I propose in this amendment, it would have given it an income stream of more than €295 million, which constitutes a substantial sum in anyone's language.  It is most unfortunate that the Government did not make this choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">When one considers the other side of the coin, the Government introduced what it called a 1% income levy.  While it really constitutes a 1% increase in taxation, if the Government wishes to call it an income levy that is fair enough.  My main problem with it is that it was introduced at the level of the minimum wage.  Once one exceeds the minimum wage by a single euro, one becomes liable for the full amount of the 1% income levy, which was a crazy choice to make.  The Minister should recognise this amendment affords a possibility to deal substantially with income streams to Revenue and she should avail of such an opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_1321">The issue of the PRSI ceiling is particularly relevant in the context of a universal insurance-based pension for all.  Given the difficulties facing people with private pensions at present and because the feedback from the Green Paper process is overdue, the Minister should indicate to Members whether she is considering the operation of such a general scheme in respect of a State pension that would cover everyone.  The question of lifting the PRSI ceiling obviously would arise in this regard and I seek the Minister's current views.</p>

          <p eId="para_1322">I do not propose to accept the amendment.  PRSI issues had to be looked at in the round in the context of the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">There is a commitment in the programme for Government envisaging abolishing the PRSI ceiling and reducing the PRSI rate.  Both were predicated on there being an average growth rate of 4.5%, which has not happened.  For various reasons, particularly from the point of view of the Department of Finance, it was decided not to lift the ceiling or to reduce the PRSI rates this year, given the current economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">Deputy Shortall asked about the pension strategy.  She will be aware that the last event in that regard was the publication of the findings of the consultation.  We are currently in discussions with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance on future strategy and it is not possible at this stage to give a clear outline in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1326">The matter is complex.  It has always been our intention to try to do it before the end of the year but it will be a long-term strategy.  It is not essential that it comes out of the end of the year because it would not take effect for a couple of years in any event.  For example, in the UK it does not take effect until 2012 and there is quite a long lead-in period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">Any change in the pensions structure for the future would involve significant benefits for people but also changes to the way they will make contributions in the future, and we must get it right.

          <p eId="para_1331">Clearly, if there will be a substantial additional burden on the Social Insurance Fund, then that fund will need support.  Surely the removal of the ceiling on PRSI would have been one mechanism to ensure that adequate funding was available to deal with the potential for significant additional numbers who will rely on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">I take this opportunity of asking the Minister, following on from Deputy Morgan's point, when she first became aware of the difficulties?  From anecdotal evidence and from speaking to businesses involved, we all are aware of the difficulties which existed in the defined benefit schemes.  On the specific memo leaked from the Department, when did the official knowledge — if I can put it that way — come to her of the scale of the difficulties?  Is it accurate that over 80% of those schemes are in severe difficulty and not in compliance with legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">While I do not have a difficulty with the thrust of the amendment, my party would abstain if it is put to a vote on the basis that I do not wish to be in the position of allowing the Minister have more money at her disposal without knowing how it will be spent.  There needs to be an overall package in the pensions area.  I am disappointed at the lack of progress that has been made in both the pensions area under the Government's direct control, the State pension, but also in the private pensions area.  I do not know that the Government is fully appreciative of the considerable difficulties and fears faced by members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">The Minister's interview on the "News at One" has left people horrified.  To have spent millions of euro encouraging people to invest in private pensions and then to tell them not to worry because in the worst case scenario they would still have the State pension is cold comfort to those who have been watching their assets and resources dwindling continuously.  One person who is near retirement age told me the other day that he would have to find a way of working for another ten years because he cannot afford to retire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">The Minister must put a little more meat on it than telling people to rely on the State pension.  While the State pension exists, the Minister and her predecessors actively encouraged people to invest in private pension schemes.  The Minister is not responsible for the fall across the board in the stock markets, but there has been significant reliance on investing in the Irish Stock Exchange by comparison to the practice in other countries where they spread the investment far more widely.</p>

          <p eId="para_1336">I fully accept the complexity of the pensions issue but that is no excuse for prevaricating any further on it.  The Government has been talking about this for several years.  We cannot afford to stand back and wait much longer.  Is the Minister inclined towards an insurance-based universal State pension system, given that the Government has spent over €4 billion, by present day standards, on an annual basis over recent years concentrating almost entirely on a tax relief system and that vast amounts of that €4 billion have been lost on the stock market?  That system has not worked.  What is the Minister's thinking on an insurance-based scheme and would she be inclined to take that route in the future?</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1337">There are two pensions issues.  The first is the long-term strategy and the other is the immediate difficulties faced by some pension funds.  Since the publication of the Green Paper over a year ago there has been a widespread consultation process, a summary of that consultation and a review at a conference in Ireland of the international situation, particularly looking at the experience in Australia, New Zealand and in the UK.  Drawing from the best of that, we are now actively working on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">It will be up to the Government to make a decision on this.  It will not be for me alone.  That is why it is important that these meetings my Department is having with the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach should go ahead and come up with suggestions on how the framework should develop over the next number of years.  It will probably not take effect until 2012, and beyond in the case of some of the suggestions within it, bearing in mind the requirement that there should be on people to make provision for their future as well so that they would not be dependent solely on the State pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">I do not believe it came as a surprise to anybody that pension schemes were in difficulty.  Pension schemes are investment schemes and investments in the markets have been badly hit because of the volatility of the markets.  One of the things one can say about the markets is that in the same way as they go down, they also go up.  At this moment in time there are a number of funds which will not be able to meet the funding standard for this year.  Over 80% of them at the end of last year stated they were able to meet all of their liabilities.  There will be many more in difficulty this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">However, no pension fund has gone bust.  No pensioner or prospective pensioner has been left in any difficulty.  Where in the past difficulties have arisen the employers have made good the gap which arose.</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">——was to make the Government aware of the difficulties of the individual funds.  Hopefully, as the markets pick up, the position can improve for people in that regard.  As I already indicated, we are allowing employers more time to come up with their funding proposals to ensure that their pension funds can get back into a solvent position.  The Pensions Board will allow up to ten years for a fund to recoup any losses that it would have incurred.  Normally, we give a fund 12 months to come up with its proposals but we are now giving them 18 months.  We are trying to facilitate employers, in the case of these defined benefit schemes, in determining how they will be able to protect their workers into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">There is no need for panic.  Having said that, the markets are difficult and the pension funds are facing challenges.  We are actively working with pension fund managers and the Pensions Board and have held a number of meetings on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">Much of the information contained in the memo was not new.  I flagged the matter last week at the launch of the report of the Pensions Ombudsman but I only received a couple of paragraphs in the business pages.  Pension fund managers also pointed out the difficulties that have arisen.  I appreciate that once something is stated in a Government memo, it takes on more gravitas.  Concerns were caused by the leak rather than by any interviews conducted subsequently because our aim with the State pension is always to protect vulnerable people.  In the short term, people do not need to be overly concerned because no pension has gone bust and no pensioner has been left without an investment.</p>

I acknowledge that the markets have experienced difficulties since 11 September 2001 but the scale of the current crisis was not expected.  There was room for an element of shock because not everybody who holds a pension watches the market closely.  The Minister is correct that no scheme has gone bust yet and long may that continue.  However, while I do not want to be alarmist or cause people further concern, I have to point out that it is not looking good for a number of schemes.

          <p eId="para_1361">I return to this issue of fostering as there may have been some confusion about it in the past.  It arises from a case I brought to the attention of the Minister's Department where an unmarried couple had fostered two children.  The woman in question passed away and the man had to give up his job.  He applied for the one parent family payment but was refused despite him having cohabited with his partner for 28 years.  They were, to all intents and purposes, a couple.  He was refused because he was not regarded as a qualified parent because he is not the parent of a qualified child.  The term "parent" does not include a foster parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">If the man was in the same position with two foster children and had a child of his own, he would have had a qualified child and would have got the payment for all three children.  There is clearly a problem with the legislation.  This has been identified by senior people in the Minister's Department as an anomaly which needs to be addressed by way of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">When we got the briefing, we were advised that the Bill as drafted provided for the widening of the definition of a parent to include people in the quite unusual circumstances I outlined.  I was prepared to take that at face value until I raised it on Committee Stage and was advised by the Minister that this was not the intention of the change in the legislation, and that it was the Minister's intention to ensure that a person in such circumstances would not get the one parent family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">I am at a loss to know what to do from here on in.  This is a real issue that has been identified as an anomaly in the legislation.  The indication strongly given by the Department was that it would be dealt with and yet the Minister has indicated it will not be.  If there is some confusion, I accept that and it is fine.  Will the Minister consider dealing with the anomaly in the legislation?  The number of people being affected is quite small but it is a clear anomaly which needs to be addressed.</p>

Such anomalies happen all over the place and there is no big deal about them; the trick is to get them sorted out quickly.  I suspect the matter has not been cleared up in this case although I understand the Minister was going to do so from what has been said previously this afternoon by my colleagues in Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">It is most unfortunate the Minister is not taking an objective view on this matter.  If there are people suffering needlessly because this Bill requires amendment, surely there is still time even at this late stage for the Minister to move an amendment to correct the anomaly.  It is reasonable for the Minister to consider such a move.</p>

          <p eId="para_1369">As I indicated earlier, the foster care allowance is €312 per child under 12, or €339 per child aged 12 or over.  Therefore, a recipient could be getting €678 for fostering two children.  To get the lone parent allowance on top of that would mean they would be getting approximately €880 per week, which is a very substantial payment.  I accept the valuable work that foster carers do and the allowance is to meet the weekly costs of the children within their care.  I will look into the situation, given the facts of the particular case Deputy Shortall mentioned, but it will not be for the purposes of this Bill.  I am not sure, however, that one would be giving allowances or payments to the tune of €3,300 a month to somebody to look after two foster children.  I know the Deputy genuinely got an impression from a briefing, but it is not my understanding.  I will certainly check it out for future reference, however.</p>

          <p eId="para_1370">With all due respect, the Minister is missing the point.  In the circumstances I have outlined, if that man had a natural child of his own there would not be an issue.  That is because the natural child would be a qualifying child under the legislation and the man would be paid the one parent family payment for all three children.  Equally, if the man was a widower or a separated married man, he would qualify as a parent.  The issue is not that there would be a foster payment and a one parent family payment.  The issue concerns the current definitions concerning the qualifying child and the qualifying parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">The unusual circumstances I outlined to the Minister have shown up an anomaly in the legislation because in this family situation they neither meet the qualifying child definition nor the qualifying parent definition.  At a senior level, the Minister's Department has identified this as an anomaly that needs to be dealt with.  We have been through this on Committee Stage and I am disappointed the matter has not been addressed.  I expected the Minister to come back to us with proposals on Report Stage and it is disappointing that nobody seems to have bothered to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1383">This amendment is connected to the previous one and concerns the definition of a parent in respect of the lone parent allowance.  According to the briefing, this change was being made to cater for scenarios such as the one I outlined in respect of the fostering case.  I was advised that this was why the Minister was enabling a broader definition of "parent".  When I read the definition, that seemed to be what the Minister was doing in the first half, but subsection (2) contains a saver clause.  On the one hand, the Minister claims she is broadening the definition, but, on the other, subsection (2) states in this new broader definition that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1384">Subsection (1) shall not apply, where a person's entitlement to one-parent family payment has been established before the coming into operation of that subsection, for the duration of that person's continuous entitlement to one-parent family payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">I was concerned when I read that saver clause because it seems to me that the Minister had to insert it, stating that anybody who has already got an entitlement to a one parent family payment will not be affected by this change.  Quite clearly, the intention of this change is to further restrict the one parent family payment.  This is also contrary to the briefing I was given.  In those circumstances, I have no choice but to object to the whole section and seek its deletion.  I do not think the Minister knows what she is doing concerning changes to the lone parent definition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1386">For a certain amount of the time, the provision would ensure that a category of unmarried persons is not excluded by removing the old anomaly that is there.  The current definition includes five different people: widow,  widower, separated spouse, an unmarried person or a person whose spouse has been committed in custody to a prison or a place of detention for not less than six months.  They must have at least one qualifying child normally residing with them.  The purpose of the section is to remove the anomaly whereby an unmarried claimant for the one family payment must be the parent of the qualified child for whom they are claiming, whereas a separated or widowed person does not have to be a parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The second aspect is to define the relationship between the claimant and the qualified child to ensure that they have to be the parent, step parent, adoptive parent or legal guardian of the qualified child, that the child must normally reside with them and that this is in the best interests of the child.  The term "step parent" has been included because there could have been some cases where the claimant is caring full-time for a child that is not their own, but the parent may not be able to obtain legal guardianship.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform advised that there were cases where a husband or wife was caring for the children but the biological parent was still alive, so the provision allows for that situation also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">The genuine intention is to broaden the measure.  It only applies to new claimants, which is what the Deputy is saying, so that if there is a delay in a person becoming a legal guardian he or she will get assistance as an interim measure.  It does not apply to current recipients, so it will be for new claimants.  The intention is to broaden it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1389">This is a highly unsatisfactory situation because I am being given conflicting information.  I was told originally that, in the first part of this, the definition of "parent" for the purpose of qualifying for a one parent family payment was being widened to take into consideration the specific case I raised.  As I said, the person in this case was precluded from getting a one parent family payment.  One of the reasons he did not qualify as a qualified parent was because of his unmarried status.  I was told that the change the Minister was introducing was to cater for somebody like that.  On Committee Stage, however, the Minister told me that she would not favour that.  I can only conclude that the Minister has made a mistake.  It seemed absolutely clear to me originally from the briefing that the Minister would take into consideration the case I raised, but she then backtracked on it on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">If the definition is to be extended, why is a saver clause necessary?  Such a clause is intended to clarify that those who got in under the line will remain in whereas others may not in future.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1416">In page 9, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1417">"(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the link between receipt of lone parent allowance and the commencement of employment.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1418">(4) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the progress made to support and encourage one parent families in entering the workforce.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">I am tabling these amendments, having discussed them on Second and Committee Stages, because we always seem to be a report away from a decision in terms of one parent families.  Despite the Minister and her two immediate predecessors availing of frequent air time and newspaper pages to discuss this issue, they have talked around it.  No changes that would substantially alter lives have resulted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">A number of issues are involved, the first of which Deputy Shortall outlined, namely, cohabitation and the poverty traps that might ensue if a couple decide to live together.  Many people accept that this would be a preferable situation from the children's perspective, but it is impossible for many couples because of the way in which the payment has been structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">Work is another issue, a report on which was recently launched by the Minister to join a number of other reports.  In the most recent report, 84% of one parent families that responded to the survey stated that they were looking for work or were engaged in education or training.  It is a concern that only 16% of those who engaged in work believed that they were better off as a result.  The disincentive is immediately visible.  Once people go out to work, the amount of money they bring home is not substantial enough to make it worth their while.  One could not blame them for not being enticed into work.  The unaffordability of quality child care and jobs not being financially worth their while were the highest ranked reasons for leaving work.  In certain parts of the country, quality child care is not even available to those who could afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">I hope that the current Minister, one of three who has made the promise, will publish a report on one-parent families.  The Government published a document several years ago, but a decision document is anticipated.  Some of the Minister's interviews in this regard, particularly those given during the summer, caused me concern.  I accept that the 84% would rather work or have education or training, but the impression given by the Minister is that people will be forced into work once their children reach a particular age.  It is an unusual philosophy to develop when the level of unemployment is rising.  I support the concept of allowing lone parents to work, as it is good for those who make the decision, but lone parents have the same rights as married and cohabiting couples if they choose to remain in the home to look after their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">We must facilitate people's entrance into the workforce by providing quality child care and ensuring that their employment pays and is flexible, as lone parents often do not have someone to cover for them between 3.30 p.m. or 4 p.m. when their children finish school and when they finish work at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.  We must also ensure that people have transportation to child care facilities and their workplaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">The Minister's proposals must address the issues holistically.  The "big stick" approach, where someone is given a choice between going out the door to get a job when his or her child reaches seven years of age or something else that is not yet known, will not work unless the other barriers are dealt with.  I am not convinced that they have been addressed sufficiently.  Nor am I convinced by the Government's commitment, given the messing around last year with child care facilities and the payment structures therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">I will press the amendment, to which I will also speak in terms of increases, since our other attempts to do so were ruled out of order.  As with the elderly and those in receipt of job seeker's allowance, one parent families find themselves at a great risk of poverty.  They are four and a half times more likely to live in poverty, a statistic to which the Minister has alluded.  Today's survey outlined improvements and, from the Minister's comments, many of the people in question had the opportunity to work.  The right structures can pay off.  Regardless of difficult circumstances, however, this year's increase in the payment will make life difficult for one parent families, given increases in the costs of food and fuel.  There is no doubt that the changes in the child benefit and early child care supplement payments will hit those families the hardest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">It is disturbing that the Department does not keep a flow analysis of one parent family payments.  From the information collated, we know how many people receive the payment, but no statistics are available on people who work for a period before receiving the payment again.  Those statistics would reveal what barriers exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">During the summer, the Minister announced the appointment of 50 facilitators who will work on a one-to-one basis with the 84,000 one parent families that are in receipt of State support and the 270,000 people on the live register who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  That number of facilitators is not adequate and is evidence that the Government does not take this matter seriously.  Pilot projects in respect of lone parents were launched in Coolock and Kilkenny, but those in Opposition have not yet seen the reports relating to these projects in order to discover if they have worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">The Government has not done anything to facilitate one parent families, either from the perspective of the children or that of their parents.  The report to which I refer and the findings relating to the pilot schemes should be made available to Members in order that we might discuss this matter in full.  There should be no secrets about these projects.  Regardless of whether they are good or bad, the findings that emerge will reflect the reality faced by one parent families.  There is a need for a proper debate on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1429">Will the Minister indicate her intentions regarding reforms in respect of one parent family payments?  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to changes in recent years.  Those changes were identified some time ago and there are various proposals as to how they might be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">I referred earlier to cohabitation and activation, the key issues relating to which are access to quality education, training and employment opportunities.  I emphasise the need for quality in this regard because it is often the case that a push is made to encourage people to take up low grade, low paid jobs.  Issues also arise with regard to the support and advice people receive.  Such support and advice are often less than satisfactory.  There is a need to have in place individuals who can provide proper advice on the routes people can take into education, training or employment.  A great deal of hands on, practical advice is often required and this is not always available.  The third major area on which we need to focus in this regard is access to child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">We have been discussing these matters for a long period.  It is time action was forthcoming.  Will the Minister indicate the timescale she envisages in respect of bringing forward proposals in this regard?</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1432">I support the amendment.  There are many bottlenecks in the journey from welfare to work.  Deputy Shortall referred briefly to one of the major issues in this regard, namely, child care.  One parent families are often extremely isolated and the fact that they do not have the support of the extended family structure that might apply in the case of other people makes their burden even heavier.  I wish the Government would tackle the bottlenecks to which I refer in order to facilitate people in completing the journey from welfare to work.  It would be better for society, in a host of ways, if the people in question could complete the journey to which I refer.  Very many of these individuals want to do so.  It is a pity they are being allowed to fulfil their ambition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_644" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1433">As a number of Deputies stated, the Government published a discussion paper which contains its proposals for supporting lone parents.  This paper puts forward suggestions and proposals on tackling obstacles to employment not just for lone parents, but also for low income families.  Our strategy for the future refers not only to lone parents, but also to those on qualified adult payments and low incomes.  We want to discover how these people can be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">It is always difficult to discuss lone parents in the context of the social welfare system.  There are 100,000 lone parents who are not dependent on social welfare payments, who are in employment, who are rearing their children, who are doing the best they can and who never turn to the State for assistance.  There are then the 85,000 people who are dependent on social welfare and who are in receipt of the one parent family payment.  We estimate that approximately 60% of the latter are also in employment.  However, they tend to occupy low paid jobs and part-time positions and their work has to be organised around their child care and parenting needs.  The initiatives introduced in recent years to allow lone parents to work without their payments being interfered with have encouraged them to take up employment.  However, we have discovered that people tend to work only the requisite number of hours and do not exceed this because they fear losing their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">In many other countries, state payments for one parent families cease when children reach four, five or six years of age.  I refer here to Canada, Australia, Sweden and Finland.  Such payments cease at three months in the United States.  The United Kingdom is reducing the age at which payments will cease to ten.  In Ireland, lone parents can continue to receive payments until their children reach 22 years of age so long as those children remain in education.  As a result of the conditions that apply, this militates against lone parents forming long-term relationships, marrying or entering the workforce.  The conditions we have established in our social welfare system — for which we must take responsibility — are probably not in the best long-term interests of lone parents, their children or society in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">Certain countries introduced voluntary systems with regard to activating people to re-enter the workforce but these did not work.  People do not take up the option in this regard because they fear they will lose out.  The proposals that have been set out — which, to a large degree, form the basis of what will be our future policy — refer to working with lone parents and other low income families in the areas of training and education, providing them with child care supports and dealing with those issues that are paramount to those who are on their own.  Working with the Office of the Minister for Children, increasing the number of child care places available and providing community child care facilities are central to our policy in this area.  Encouraging people to re-enter education and training is also important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">In the past year alone, a number of lone parents availed of the back-to-education allowance in order to pursue second and third level courses.  Some 1,386 lone parents availed of the second level option, while 561 availed of that relating to third level.  A further 1,271 availed of the back-to-work allowance.  The research indicates that where they are given encouragement and support, lone parents are anxious to avail of the best education and training in order that they might participate in the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">The proposals to which I refer form a framework.  It was originally envisaged that payment would cease when children reached seven or eight years of age.  I am of the view that this is too young.  When a lone parent first comes into receipt of social welfare payments, he or she should be guided, directed and given as much support as possible.  That is the basis of our strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">It is not in the best interests of a child, his or her parent or society to pay out money until he or she reaches 22 years of age without first providing that parent every support that will allow him or her to play his or her full role in society.  I am obliged to consider this matter from the perspective of poverty.  It is extremely encouraging that the statistics relating to lone parents in poverty have dropped significantly.  As already stated, there was a sharp fall in the consistent poverty rate among lone parent households from 33.9% in 2006 to 20.1% in 2007.  However, the child of a lone parent remains four times more likely to be in poverty than any of his or her peers.  The consistent poverty rate among these children fell from 10.3% to 7.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">It is in the best interests of everyone to have a long-term strategy in place.  We have been working on this matter a great deal but I required time to meet representatives of the various groups and consider the findings in the reports relating to the pilot projects in Coolock and Kilkenny.  What we discovered is that lone parents do not constitute a homogenous group.  The backgrounds, education, training, aspirations, family circumstances, support structures, access to child care, transport needs, etc., of these individuals are all different.  This can make developing a long-term strategy difficult.  However, I am hopeful that I will be in a position to introduce that strategy next spring.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_645">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1441">I am aware that lone parents do not constitute a homogenous group.  However, the structure of the system is such that we are obliged to discuss the amendments we table in the context of the type of payments that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">The Minister has a great ability to outline a problem rather than offer a solution.  I do not believe any of the points the Minister has made differ from those the Opposition would make.  The point we are making — I will be brief as I wish to press this amendment — is that we have not seen any action in this regard.  While the Minister can speak about the pilot schemes in Coolock, Kilkenny and so on, that information has not been made available to the public.  We have not had an opportunity to study that information to assess what the people surveyed, those in receipt of these payments, had to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">The Minister has outlined the depth of the problems in respect of education, training and employment.  However, the 50 facilitators appointed cannot possibly work on a one-to-one basis with 84,000 people in receipt of State support through the one-parent family payment.  If we are truly to get activation and to guide these people off that payment and into the workforce, we must deal with ancillary problems such as child care, although such problems are not ancillary to parents but are very much part of the structure of their lives.  All of this must be taken into account if activation is to work.  We must facilitate people to return to work rather than use the stick to do so.  The majority of people surveyed, 84%, want to work and so that is not the kernel of the problem.  We must address overall family and child care situations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1444">It is precisely because children of lone parents are at a much higher risk of poverty that we are asking the Minister to take action.  The time for talking is over.  As I said earlier, this issue was raised initially by the late Deputy Seamus Brennan who drafted proposals in this regard.  He was succeeded by former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Martin Cullen, who talked about the issue and the Minister is now talking about it again.  What we need is action.  The issues have been clearly identified.  The Minister needs to clarify her thinking in respect of cohabitation.  The proposal was to have a family payment which would be paid in respect of children living in poverty irrespective of whether there was one or two parents in the home.  This payment was to be directed at the child.  Also, that payment was to be made available regardless of whether the parents were working in order to remove the poverty traps in respect of cohabitation and the work versus welfare scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">I concur with the comments in respect of the inadequacy of quality services in terms of jobs facilitators and in respect of child care.  The Minister seemed to be implying that the fault is on the part of lone parents.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_651">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1591">I am pleased to contribute to this important debate on agriculture.  I have already made numerous comments and suggestions over the years in this regard.  I have made many suggestions in this House that some of the farming organisations did not like, but I knew I was correct and am glad I was vindicated in the viewpoint I often articulated in the House in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">I wish to particularly comment during this debate on the number of reductions in vital expenditure areas proposed by the Minister.  When implemented, these will have significant and profound adverse effects on the farming community.  I recall as a young student in UCD in 1974 that up to 325,000 people in Ireland were classified as farmers and approximately 0.5% of the land became available for transfer through sale and-or inheritance.  We have witnessed in the past few decades a virtual decimation of the number of farmers.  If things keep going as they have gone over the past 30 years, we will have only approximately 30,000 full-time farmers by 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593">I also recall the fact that farmers were not generally transferring lands <i>inter vivos</i> at farm level.  They were passed on upon the death of the landholder through inheritance by the instrument of the will.  There was then the advent of two very important and effective social change instruments, namely, the early retirement scheme and installation aid scheme.  These schemes were facilitative in nature, and with the addition of some monetary rewards, they altered the landscape for the earlier transfer of farms within or outside the family while still retaining the integrity of same.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">The payment under the scheme is €15,000, it used to be £5,000 and then it increased to £7,500.  That payment was extremely useful and of great assistance to young farmers who in order to benefit had to have attained certain educational qualifications.  The grant helped defray some of the legal costs associated with the lease or transfer involved.  These were important schemes in speeding up the transfer of farms leading to an increase in productivity ultimately, and the retaining of another young person on the land, thereby arresting the drain or depletion in the number of farmers, which is important in terms of the social fabric and infrastructure of rural Ireland, which is under threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595">From the foregoing perspective it makes eminent sense, both from a financial and social standpoint, to ensure that those schemes are restored and the suspensions proposed by the Government lifted.  The installation aid grant of €15,000 pales into insignificance when it is compared with the cost of generating an IDA-backed job.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_653">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1597">Farming is another important job in rural areas where for various reasons it is extremely difficult to secure any jobs.  Small shop owners know the importance of the rural community, especially the farming community, in ensuring the sustainability of local jobs and the spending of money in the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1598">What will happen to young farmers who have made significant advances in order to participate in the scheme but who did not have the application form submitted by the cut-off date of 14 October 2008?  In the current economic crisis, has any other European Union member state carried out the same suspension, cut or removal of an important support for young farmers or those who are trying to get started?  I would hazard a guess that no other European country has embarked upon that process to undermine in such a deliberate way an effort to keep young farmers on the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_1599">The €34 million cut in disadvantaged area payments will impact significantly on up to 40,000 low-income farmers with the cut in the area eligible for farm payments from 45 hectares to 35 hectares.  That smacks of desperation.  It will particularly hurt those farming in hill areas.  The halving of the suckler cow payment from €80 to €40 will have an impact also.  The Minister explained that not a cent of the intended budget for this worthwhile scheme will be lost as a result of what he euphemistically calls an adjustment in the payment process.  Nevertheless, the budget cuts in those two areas will also impact on farmers in the midland and lowland areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">I wish to give an example from the area in Longford-Westmeath that I represent where I get a huge farming vote.  Who would not do so?  The average loss of income for farmers in Longford due to the cut in the suckler welfare scheme will be €720 and in Westmeath it will be €904.  The cut in the disadvantaged area grant will result in a loss of income per farm of €995 in Longford and €982 in Westmeath.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601">I called some time ago for an extension of the deadline for the farm waste management scheme.  Between 2000 and 2006, €978 million was spent, excluding VAT, on capital investment in farm buildings.  This year €1 billion will be spent, yet next year only €330 million will be spent.  One does not need to be a mathematical genius to suggest what will happen.  Just when we had 17,000 extra workers added to the live register today, the Minister has cut the legs out from under everybody.  The scheme could have been extended.  We all know what happened with the weather.  For three months one could not put a swan out on the land no matter what part of Ireland one was in.  It was absolutely stupid to abolish that scheme.  We should remember that it is only a money-saving exercise by the Exchequer.  The extension of the scheme does not need EU approval.  The scheme closed in 2006.  The numbers are there.  The money that needs to be allocated is already defined, delineated and demarcated.  It was only a penny-pinching exercise by the Exchequer not to extend the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">No one should tell me about Europe.  Can it interfere in such a way as to abolish our right to ensure that we have the farm installation and buildings that are needed for the comfort and convenience of animals, apart from the improvement in environmental standards that will result?  Those schemes provided a considerable amount of work in rural areas.  I refer again to Johnny Owens's firm that used to employ 130 people but that number went down to 80.  A further 40 people have been laid off and a number of others are under notice.  That is what the suspension of the scheme has meant in rural areas.  If the scheme had been extended for five or six months we could have kept the construction industry going for that period and got it over the hump.  I cannot understand the Minister's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1603">The over-enforcement of the nitrates directive in regard to tillage farmers is of concern.  Again, the prevailing poor weather conditions has had a major impact.  Now tillage farmers are being harassed by the ploughing regulations introduced under the nitrates directive.  I wrote a book on the issue.  I cannot understand how the regulations slipped under everyone's radar.  We need to address the issue as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604">There is a requirement that ground ploughed must have a green cover within six weeks of ploughing.  In bad weather one does not have to be Einstein or a first-year agriculture student to realise that such a proposition causes extreme difficulty for a tillage farmer.  How can a grower who has ploughed ground in wet conditions and who has experienced compaction, an obvious consequence of using heavy machinery, which is something we all know a bit about, be expected to go back and sow crops that have a green cover, where the failure to do so would result in penalties?  In addition, there is cross-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">Is the Minister's Department implementing this measure or is it the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  We had better find out quickly and get our act together because farmers have to adhere to good practice.  Farmers are utilising the book of good farming practice.  That is what we should use to implement the directive and not have people checking for cross-compliance and cutting up to 5% from payments due.  The head will not be worth the wash as they say in Westmeath if the Government keeps going the way it is.  The Government should get its house in order.  This particular regulation is stupid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606">It is more stupid when one looks at how the issue is being handled in the United Kingdom.  A green cover is not required there for the winter period and that is eminently sensible.  Neither is there a closed period for ploughing in the United Kingdom.  On the contrary, the UK environmental agency appears to promote winter ploughing and subsoiling, especially where compaction is a problem.  Furthermore, the nitrogen recommendation for main crops is significantly higher in the UK legislation.  The system that operates in the UK appears to adopt a more flexible approach, which clearly takes cognisance of the practical situation that applies to ground and is sensible.  Given the inclement weather of recent summers and autumns, which pertained during the harvest period, it is clear there was significant impaction which necessitates subsoiling and early ploughing.  Late ploughing in such circumstances results in poor establishment, less efficient use of nitrates, deficiencies and reduced yields and an increased risk of disease and carryover from volunteer cereals.  That is very important even though one might not know a lot about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607">Equality of treatment is an essential element that is supposed to underpin the application of EU legislation.  It appears that rules which are environmental in nature are not being consistently applied across the EU.  Why should Irish growers be more constrained, disadvantaged and punished?  That is the type of measure that led to farmers, among others, adopting a negative tone, when they should not have done, to the vote on the Lisbon treaty.</p>

If they had any respect for the construction industry — since the party no longer has a tent at the Galway Races, perhaps they do not know who their friends are, but they probably still have a few friends in the construction industry — they should make sure that small businesses are looked after such as that of Johnny Owens.  They should remove the requirement in respect of the 31 December clause.  It is only a penny-pinching exercise.  There is no EU restriction or impediment preventing the Minister from extending that period.  The authorities in Northern Ireland are prepared to do it and the period there has been extended up to March.</p>

          <p eId="para_1622">Coming from a small farming background, I am only too well aware of the difficulties being experienced by farmers nationally.  The value of farming and farm produce to society cannot be overestimated.  I was reared on a farm, which is now farmed by my brother, and I am aware that the vast majority of my supporters come from a small farming background in Donegal.  My background keeps me very much in touch with the concerns of farmers, particularly at present.  It is regrettable that farmers are experiencing difficulties in certain areas.  Unfortunately, this is unavoidable given the global economic decline.  Given this decline, we must recognise that limited resources are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623">It galled me recently to listen to some commentators on farming.  There is negativity in the farming sector although unprecedented funding was invested of late in areas such as farm waste management.

          <p eId="para_1631">On a positive note, spending on REPS will be increased to €355 million next year, thus ensuring new entrants will be catered for, and the Minister deserves credit for doing everything in his power to protect the REPS payment.  There are currently approximately 60,000 participants in the REP scheme, which addresses environmental imperatives and consumer demand for environmentally friendly food production.  Under REPS 4, grant aid will be increased by 17%, which is very much welcomed on this side of the House.  Expenditure on forestry will be increased by 6%.  This will facilitate a similar level of planting to that of this year.  The benefit is twofold in that it will help to boost the income of farmers and contribute to addressing climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632">The suckler welfare scheme was established recently and expenditure is expected to amount to €215 million over five years.  However, the number of participants has substantially exceeded expectation and, as a result, there is pressure to reduce the rate of payment per animal to bring expenditure back within the €215 million limit.  This is in accordance with what the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, stated when announcing the grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633">There are a number of areas in which farmers are experiencing difficultly but I am confident that the Minister, Deputy Smith, will deliver for them, as he has done recently in respect of REPS.  I commend him on his efforts to address concerns raised during the WTO talks earlier in the year.  He handled those talks very well——</p>

          <p eId="para_1640">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I, like some other Members, come from a small farm in the west, unlike Deputy Penrose, who obviously comes from somewhere with much better land.  In Clare, the majority of farms are small and much of the land is marginal.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_683">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_1642">There is not too much marginal land where Deputy Tom Hayes comes from.  Deputy Breen, who is sitting beside him, will be able to tell him about the difficultly farmers face in County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">I would not be in this House were it not for the support I receive from farmers and their families throughout County Clare.  I respect my mandate and will work with other Deputies on behalf of farmers.  We will continue to do so, despite the current economic environment.  However, I would not be doing much of a service to those who elected me if I were not honest with them about the cuts.  I have worked hard on behalf of farmers for the six and a half years in which I have had the privilege to be a Member, both in the Dáil and Seanad.  I have worked with my colleagues in the parliamentary party and in the farmers' representative bodies.  We have worked well collectively over the years to ensure that, when possible, farming was given the support it rightly deserved.  The farming organisations should not make apologies to anybody for the approach they have taken.  They have worked well on behalf of those they represent.  The chief executive of one such organisation is retiring.  There might be a job for him representing Deputies given that he did such a good job for farmers when in office.  We wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">I accept that the cuts will have a very significant impact on farm families if made in conjunction with the other cuts announced in the budget, be they in respect of school transport, college registration or the 1% income levy.  The reality is that our economy is in a perilous state, as are economies throughout the world.  It is important that we take cognisance of that and that the Government deals with it as best it can.  There are no easy answers and we are borrowing to fund current expenditure.  The projection for next year, just to meet current spending, is in the region of €4.8 billion.  There has been a 13% decrease in the tax take this year alone.  It is not sustainable to continue borrowing at the current level.  It will place further pressure on the capacity of the State to deliver services for farming families and their offspring in the years ahead.  Farmers will recognise and accept the importance of stabilising the economy.  One does not have to be an eminent economist to know or figure out that if one's books do not balance, one must first look to one's spending to try to achieve stability.  It is with a somewhat heavy heart that we must ask farmers at this very difficult time to assist us in addressing the economic crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">The sad reality is that the contributions of the Fine Gael Members in this debate have demonstrated, once again, their fiscal hypocrisy.  They have demonstrated this consistently, week in, week out, since the budget.  They demonstrate in the House on the issue of the day and bring their band of supporters.  They put forward no suggestions.  They showed the farmers what they thought of them when a better media opportunity arose in respect of the cervical cancer vaccine.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_1673">I welcome the chance to speak in support of the Government amendment and particularly in support of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith.</p>
          <p eId="para_1674">It is important to remember that in the current very difficult economic situation there will be a spend in 2009 of €3.2 billion in agriculture, a reduction of 2.5% on that of 2008.  This small reduction, in comparison to those made in other Departments, is necessary in light of the situation.  The Minister has admitted these cuts.  It is important to remember some facts in respect of the broad issue.  The CAP health check, skillfully negotiated by the Minister and his team of officials in the midst of a very difficult negotiating environment in the post Lisbon treaty atmosphere, represents a solid outcome for Irish agriculture and will deliver an extra €175 million over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1675">Although milk quotas will be abolished in 2015, the arrangements secured by the Minister will ease the changes that will ensue from this radical departure for Irish agriculture.  There is a cumulative increase of 9% in the quota to 2014, equivalent to an additional 500 million litres compared to 2007.  Based on existing milk prices, which are increasingly under pressure, these production rights will amount to approximately €100 million.  I especially welcome that the Minister, in his speech to the ICMSA last week, in the context of the increased money for modulation, committed to engage with all the farm organisations with regard to the axis he secured to unused funds in the single farm payment ceilings.  Those funds will amount to €70 million over the next four years.  Additional money is to be directed specifically at farm incomes and at sectors under pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1676">I know the Minister is aware of the pressures on the sheep sector and I hope he will place those farmers first in the queue.  From the commitments he made in Limoges, I know that he intends to do so.  Although the early retirement and installation aid schemes are temporarily suspended, I welcome the commitment made by the Minister to review that position as soon as current constraints permit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_712">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_713">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_1678">Some €48 million will be paid in 2009 for farmer pensions and €9 million will be paid in installation aid grants.  In the case of young farmers, the budget and the Finance Bill have extended a number of specific releases to the agricultural sector, worth €65 million for next year alone.  I understand that during a previous period the retirement schemes were suspended and were reinstated.  There is a good commitment there on the part of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1679">The farm waste management scheme was referred to earlier.  It should be mentioned that this is the most generous on-farm investment scheme in the history of the State, with funding of €615 million paid between 2007 and 2009.  Since the original scheme was introduced €700 million has been paid.  The sum of €615 million achieved for one scheme should be seen as a commitment of the national development plan.  The partnership talks will provide €350 million for all farm investment programmes, another good sign of that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1680">REPS 4 payments in 2009 show a 17% increase.  That expenditure will ensure €355 million for REPS, a 7% increase in overall funding.  I accept and understand that the reductions in disadvantaged area payments are causing the greatest impact and are possibly getting less attention.  Equally, I have full confidence that the Minister is aware of the impact of this in general, and of the disproportionate impact in certain areas, and that as soon as resources allow he will act.  It is important to remember that €2.3 billion will have been paid in disadvantaged area payments over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">The issue of farm to gate prices is not directly referred to in this motion but is an issue of great concern to me and to members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, chaired by Deputy Penrose.  The committee is currently reviewing the grocery market.  As part of my work on that committee, last week I attended a meeting of Macra na Feirme.  I discovered that one multiple is earning €282 per lamb while farmers are getting €78 for the same animal.  That is an issue the committee is committed to review.  We will bring the matter to attention in January during a hearing into our food prices.  I welcome engagement from the various farm organisations in that process in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1682">It is important to remember and to reflect on the sizeable budget and the considerable expenditure that is going to agriculture for next year, despite the cuts that will affect it.  I know the Minister is aware of the impact of the cuts and that as soon as resources allow he will work to alleviate the worst of those.  I am happy to support the amendment and to support the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_714">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1683">Like other speakers I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this matter.  We are in a difficult and unprecedented economic period and we must be realistic about the situation we face.  We must work together to pull through the current financial downturn.  Reactions to the announcements of the budgetary measures that affect agriculture have been unfair.  However, they are understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1684">I wish to focus on some of the changes that will be introduced under the budget.  The disadvantaged area payments will see more than 65,000 of the 102,000 participants experience no reductions in their payments.  Participants with the average site holding of 31 hectares will not be affected by the Minister's decision.  However, in fairness, I implore the Minister to restore the scheme to the way it was as soon as resources become available.  The change particularly affects people on marginal land who have 45 or 50 hectares of low stocking density because of the quality of the land.  That should be addressed and I am sure the Minister will do so as soon as funds are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1685">The commitment to provide €250 million in funding for the suckler welfare scheme will be honoured in full.  The installation aid and early retirement schemes, although suspended, will resume at the earliest possible date.  Significant tax reliefs, worth an estimated €65 million annually, were extended in the budget.  Some of these reliefs will be of particular benefit to young farmers, with stamp duty relief worth €53 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1686">With regard to the farm waste management scheme, there will be no funding shortfall.  All cases completed before 31 December will be paid between 2000 and 2009——</p>

        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_716">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1688">Every grant that is approved will be paid.  There is an important point.  One listens to commentators and thinks that this money comes from Europe.  It does not.  Every cent of this money comes from the Irish taxpayer.  In fairness, as was said earlier, I do not believe that €615 million will be sufficient.  A number of applications have yet to come in before the end of the year and we are very much aware of that.  Time is running tight and people are trying to finish.  I believe and hope they will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1689">The funding commitment of €79 million in respect of the farm improvement scheme will be provided and honoured in full.  The Government has ensured we will receive the maximum amount of funding from Brussels allowed under the scheme.  Any inference that taxpayers' money is being wasted or being sent back to Brussels is inaccurate.  These measures ensure the most efficient possible use of taxpayers' funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">Tough times call for appropriate measures.  Considerable improvements have been achieved in recent years in this country.  Nothwithstanding these improvements, it is important to acknowledge that we are currently in the middle of an international economic and financial storm.  We are not immune from its effects nor will we be.  We must be realistic about what must be done in order that we can safeguard the gains made and ensure we are well positioned to benefit from the global economic pick up when it emerges.  The agricultural sector is still a very important part of our country's tradition and we must do all we can to ensure it remains an integral part of who we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">The short-term economic environment in Ireland has become much more challenging.  We are not unique in this regard.  Prospects in virtually all the world's developed economies have deteriorated over the past 18 months.  The current economic situation is extremely difficult, and with such considerable tax shortfalls, it is necessary to make significant reductions in public spending.  Within each Department these have had to be made.  It is important to point out that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will still spend €1.8 billion of Irish taxpayers' money and €1.4 billion of EU funding, bringing to €3.2 billion the Department's total expenditure and support for agriculture, fisheries and food and forestry sectors during next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">I could continue.  It is an important issue and I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak.  I will certainly implore the Minister on certain issues and I know the goodwill is there.  There is a serious overrun in the farm waste management scheme.  In my view, it should be closer to €800 million rather than €600 million.  If we were to get those grants paid there would be funds to bring back the disadvantaged area payments, the installation aid and the early retirement schemes.</p>

        <speech by="#BobbyAylward" eId="spk_717">
          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_1693">I am speaking in strong support of the Government's amendment to this motion both as a farmer and as the father of a young farmer.  In recent years, the Government has invested very heavily and productively in developing the agriculture and the agri-food sectors in this country and this strategy has paid dividends to Irish farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">The budget has provided €1.803 billion for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  This money comes directly from the Irish taxpayer.  The EU is the source of an additional €1.4 billion, so the total amount which will be spent on agriculture, fisheries and food is over €3.2 billion.  This is substantial spending on this critically important sector of the economy and is only 2.56% less than funding in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695">We are all now acutely aware that we are living in very straitened and harsh times where we must cut our cloth to suit our measure.  There is no easy way around this situation.  We cannot afford to spend money we do not have at our disposal at this time and economies have to be achieved across every Department.  The economic and financial reality is stark and an onus rests on all of us, in every area of economic activity, to exercise wisdom and restraint and above all, to live within our means.  There is a multiplicity of demands on the public purse and it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that our scarce resources are applied to greatest possible effect in the interests of the overall common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">This is the same reality with which the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  has had to deal.  Against a national background of diminished public resources and economic uncertainty, the Minister has been forced to take shrewd and strategic choices to safeguard the greater long-term interests of farmers and the agri-food industry.  He has had to identify and adjust his spending priorities while ensuring that the industry is adequately protected and supported.  Our expectations must be lowered and kept in line with budget parameters.  We all have to exercise a little patience.  Limited resources mean difficult choices, therefore, the Minister has focused on measures that allow the industry to be maintained and to grow its productive capacity.  The major schemes which facilitate the strategic development of the sector will continue.  I believe this is a wise and prudent decision in the existing economic climate which, we all must acknowledge, is very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">The Minister has stated publicly on more than one occasion that all the schemes and services within his Department's remit will be closely monitored closely throughout 2009 and the position will be subject to careful review.  Some of the decisions which the Minister has had to take may be unpalatable for some in the short-term but he has said expressly on more than one occasion that he will look again at those decisions in the context of the Estimates for 2010.  I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">REPS is a very positive initiative both for farmers and the environment.  The farmer is the custodian of the land and the rural environment.  Through REPS, farmers have become more conscious of the environment and the need to safeguard it.  REPS has increased awareness and respect for the natural environment and has been instrumental in achieving improvements in farming methods and practices.  Farmers must recognise that they have an important contribution to make to ensure that the environment is protected and, through the REPS programme, they can apply practical measures which are sympathetic to the environment and its proper conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">Last year farmers got a total of €311 million in funding under REPS and next year, 2009, the provision for REPS will be increased to €355 million.  I am pleased that the Minister has recognised REPS as a highly valued scheme and has decided to protect it through a 17% increase in grant rates and by ensuring that the scheme continues to admit those farmers who wish to join REPS next year.  It is worth pointing out that by the end of next year, €2.5 billion will have been received by tens of thousands of farmers in the previous ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">The farm waste management scheme is exceptionally generous.  By the end of next year, the Government will have spent €700 million in on-farm investment since the scheme's inception in 2001.  The Government has now committed extra financial resources with at least €615 million being paid between 2007-09.  For this year alone, expenditure on the scheme will exceed €377 million, following the provision of an addition €195 million last October.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">The new suckler cow scheme, which was agreed in partnership and is worth €250 million, will be honoured in full.  With regard to the 2008 scheme, a premium of €80 per animal will also be paid, with €33 million to be paid out this year while a further €44 million has been provided in 2009 to pay the remaining claims of 2008.  The balance of €173 million will then be paid to participating farmers over the remaining life of the scheme over the next four years.  The amount of the premium will depend on the participation rate for the final four years of the scheme.  I should like to see the scheme based on progressive payments and I would urge the Minister to look at that, with a certain number being paid the full rate, and then to have it divided afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">It is worth bearing in mind that by the end of 2009, €2.3 billion will have been paid out to tens of thousands of farmers under the disadvantaged area scheme and the Department will be making payments of over €220.4 million under this scheme next year.  This represents a reduction in overall funding of 14%.  The Minister has had no choice but to reduce expenditure but he has said that the reductions will be implemented in a targeted manner.  This will be achieved by reducing the maximum limit on which payments are made to 34 hectares and also by way of a small increase in the stocking density requirement.  It is expected however, that the majority of farmers will not suffer any loss in their payments under this scheme.  There are 102,000 participants in the scheme at present and 67,000 will experience no reduction in their payments.  There will be no reductions whatsoever in payments on holdings up to 34 hectares.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">The Common Agricultural Policy has been very generous to Irish farmers in the supports it has offered.  We have received €41 billion in net receipts from Europe since we joined the EU and three quarters of all that money has gone to agriculture and rural development.  Between 2007-13, a further €12.2 billion will go towards financial support for the operation of the single farm payment, REPS, on-farm investment, the disadvantaged area programme and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1704">The Minister recently negotiated the CAP health check for this country and it will deliver €170 million to farmers over the next five years.  This deal will mean €100 million worth of additional milk production and over three years and it will also mean €70 million worth of additional payments to farmers.  Milk quotas will be increased by 1% annually for each of the next five years.  The Minister will then consider the market situation so as to phase out the milk quota system smoothly when the quotas are finally abolished by 2015.  The Minister has always been at pains to emphasise that he believes a soft landing is necessary in these circumstances.  An abrupt ending of the system would necessarily cause a very sharp increase in production and a resulting sharp price decline.</p>

In addition, the adjustment in the butter fat reference is equivalent to another 2% in milk quota in 2009, and this increase is in addition to a 2% increase already in place for 2008.  During the CAP health check, the Minister doggedly pursued the issue of additional funding for farm payments and a change in the provision that will allow him to target specific sectors which are in need of special assistance.  This will enable him to support sectors and regions which are experiencing particular pressure.  I particularly ask the Minister to put this funding towards the sheep sector in which incomes have been vastly reduced over the last few years.  It is almost at the stage of collapse and if some guarantees are not forthcoming in the near future there will be no sheep industry in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1725">I want to focus on two issues, the early retirement scheme and installation aid.  The majority of communications I received from my constituents were on these two issues.  People applying for early retirement have signed over their land or rented it and have signed a legal document on which they cannot renege.  Applicants who have applied for installation aid have done their 160 hours and obtained their green certs.  Some of them have rented land and others have acquired land and signed legal documents for it.  These people have gone out and purchased animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1726">One man told me his father had black whitehead cows, but because their day is gone he went out and bought in-calf Limousin heifers, on which he spent a significant amount of money.  He did so because he had a legal document and expectations.  He did not spend 160 hours doing a course or apply for a herd number for the crack.  He had a legitimate expectation that he would qualify for installation aid of €15,000.  The man who signed over his land to a family member or who leased his land to a third party had legitimate expectations that he would be entitled to early retirement at 55 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">There are people in my constituency now whose sons or daughters can, legally, put them out on the side of the road.  Some people have agreed long-term land leases to third parties and they can effectively be put out on the side of the road.  These people entered these schemes with the legitimate expectation that they would qualify for the grant, but in one fell swoop the Minister pulled the grants.  It is for this reason that I am so surprised Deputy Aylward could come in here and read a prepared speech, particularly as he is a farmer himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">We need young people to enter farming.  It was for this reason the scheme was initiated.  It proposed to encourage young innovative farmers, like the man whose father had black whitehead sucklers, but whose son wanted to improve his herd and move to Limousins.  He spent the money, but is now left at the side of the road.  He will not qualify for installation aid and his father who has signed over the farm to him will not qualify for the early retirement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">Let us be serious about this issue.  People speak about all the money that has been gained by Irish farmers from Europe.  That money was for schemes that were set up to bring young, innovative people with new ideas into agriculture.  This is what we need.  I commend Deputy Creed on raising this motion in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1731">Last year the IDA spent €2.3 billion on capital investment and job creation.  It achieved 9,216 jobs, but in the same timeframe some 9,363 jobs were lost.  The spending figures for the agriculture sector vary, but approximately €2 billion or €3 billion was spent on the sector.  Some €66 million was spent on the early retirement scheme and installation aid.  During this time, the moneys were put in to support an industry that produces €9.2 billion to the Exchequer, 75% of which is spent in the domestic economy.  It is reckoned that IDA-type industry jobs only spend approximately 8.1% in the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">I do not raise these figures in order to criticise the IDA.  No doubt it will continue to go out and spend money to try to bring in new industry and employment, be it in IT, financial services or wherever.  It will introduce imaginative, stimulus packages to do this.  The installation aid and early retirement scheme were but a stimulus package for farming and young farmers.  We need young, trained professional farmers and at the first sign of optimism, we saw an upturn of 25% — not an insignificant figure — in the number of young students enrolling in agricultural colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">However, what has the Government done?  It has removed €9.3 million from its spend on what was the most effective stimulus package ever put in place for farming.  It has removed a further 13% from research and development, 9% from Bord Bia and a further 8% from Teagasc.  Research, training and education have all been affected and taken away from our greatest natural resource.  A month ago, Gordon Brown put in place an investigation into the security of food for the 70 million citizens for whom he is responsible, but we are potentially closing down our greatest natural resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">I will make two further points.  The national farm survey shows the average full-time farmer's income is €43,900.  If we remove the average of €900, which is the amount taken away from disadvantaged areas, this equates to a levy of over 2% on top of a levy.  Ordinary workers would need to be earning €90,000 to have the same amount of money removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735">I heard the debate today and have seen news reports that inform us that certain fish are endangered species.  Outside the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, there are two endangered species, sheep and sheep farmers.  The Minister can make a decision on the sheep sector, but he is waiting until 16 December for some reason.  I speak as a sheep farmer who produces one of the healthiest meats one can eat.  If the Minister wants to preserve the sector, he should swallow his pride and make an announcement tonight rather than wait until 16 December.  The sheep and sheep farmers will stay camped outside the Department until he does.</p>

          <p eId="para_1741">He should do so because this has nothing to do with the budget.  The money is there and while there are few enough sheep farmers at present, there will be far fewer unless this is done.  It has been disastrous that it was not done in the past three or four weeks before matters got out of hand completely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">In the few minutes at my disposal, I wish to discuss a fundamental principle that was broken by the Government when it reduced the area-based payment.  Since 1972, under the Treaty of Rome, the disadvantaged areas payment has been one of the most fundamental principles.  Everyone is aware that a farmer on 100 acres of dry free-draining soil has a better chance in this life than one on 100 acres of rushes and wetlands.  A fundamental principle on which the European Union operated down through the years was that a handicap existed in this regard.  I spent years trying to extend this payment to those areas that were duly entitled to receive it and probably have walked more acres than any other Minister in history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">However, six days before travelling to Brussels to start the round of negotiations on the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Minister savaged the area-based payment.  How can he stand up to the eurocrats and bureaucrats in Brussels and claim he believes area-based payments are important for every farmer who works on difficult soils in Ireland?  They will simply reply that he himself did not believe this to be the case when he cut the payment in the budget.  This is a fundamental principle and the Minister should be absolutely ashamed that he allowed himself to be talked into this cut.  I do not know what is happening in Agriculture House.  Alternatively, is the Minister like the Lone Ranger at the Cabinet table in that he is without a friend in the world?  If he does not have a friend at Cabinet, what kind of case can he put when in Brussels?  While I hope I am wrong, I discerned the end of area-based payments when the Government introduced this reduction, which merely constitutes the tip of the iceberg.</p>

          <p eId="para_1745">The agriculture and food production industries are of vital importance to Ireland's economic recovery as much of its gross domestic product comes from agriculture and food-related industries.  I wish to question the status of the national rural development strategy.  The package is worth €5.7 billion and includes REPS payments, disadvantaged area payments, the early retirement scheme, installation aid and farm investments.  Close to half this funding is received from the European agricultural fund for rural development.  When first launched, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food cited the package as evidence of the Government's commitment to farmers and to rural Ireland.  It also was meant to help Ireland's rural economy to diversify and become more competitive internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">I question how the funding could be decimated 18 months later, if the Government recognises its importance.  How can the Government pay lip service to the notion of social partnership in this manner?  The Government cannot allow groups such as the IFA and other farming bodies to enter discussions, make agreements, co-operate and work together to make the best plans for this industry only to then fail to honour such agreements and to renege on such vital funding for this extremely important industry.  As only 8% of Irish farmers are under 35, young and talented farmers should be retained.  Young people are the lifeblood of any industry and their energy, ideas and commitment will continue to benefit this industry for years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">I refer to some of the comments made earlier by some of the Fianna Fáil Members and to those made by Deputy Dooley in particular.  Last Sunday, I addressed almost 7,000 farmers in Ennis, County Clare.  Although there was no sign of Deputy Dooley at that meeting, I overheard him stating this evening that he did not hear the trouble in which farmers find themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_1750">I note the Minister has entered the Chamber and I plead with him to meet the sheep farmers who are protesting outside Agriculture House.  Someone suggested to me today that while the sheep are outside, there are sheep inside as well.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not right to have those farmers out there.  He has scheduled a meeting on 16 December and I call on him to meet the sheep farmers and make whatever announcement he intends to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751">First, I must compliment the Minister, who went to Europe in respect of single payment funds.  He has been allowed to use that money and all sections of the IFA and everyone else agree that this money should be devoted to the sheep sector.  I call on the Minister to give that money to the sheep sector immediately.  I will provide a simple example to the Minister.  One area of south County Mayo used to have nine farmers engaged in sheep production.  Seven farmers have ceased sheep production and another has died, thereby leaving only one person engaged in sheep production.  Unless something is done about the sheep industry, people will leave it.  This is what has happened in the west and such people will be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1752">The cuts to the disadvantaged areas scheme also constitutes another attack on the west.  Deputies Dooley, Aylward and others should recall that 18 months ago, they put out statements nationwide stating the Green Party would be bad for Fine Gael, were the former to enter Government with the latter.  While the Green Party is bad, Fianna Fáil is worse and it is time to get rid of Fianna Fáil because it is letting down rural Ireland and the farmers.  The visitors in the Gallery do not wish to be there this evening and would prefer to be at home looking after their families, farms, cattle and sheep.  Instead, however, the Government is telling them there is no need to be present because everything in agriculture is great.

          <p eId="para_1755">The Minister should meet the sheep men.  What is being done to the farming community, which is the backbone of rural Ireland in particular, is not right.  These people were not to be found in the tent in Galway but for the past 20 years have been farming and trying to make a living.  They have been attacked by Ireland and Europe and in the World Trade Organisation talks.  The Minister should do something for the sheep men and women to try to keep them at home and on the land.  The Minister should meet them tomorrow and should not leave them outside the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this cold weather for the next few weeks.  He should meet them tomorrow and should then announce the package that is available.  Were he to do so, he would be doing the decent thing and I would consider him to be a decent man.  He should do so tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_1756">Although last Sunday was a cold and frosty day, 7,500 angry farmers braved the cold and marched through the streets of Ennis to protest at the recent cold and callous budget cuts that affected every farmer, young and old.  I was delighted to be part of that protest and believe the absence of Ministers and Government Deputies, including Deputy Dooley, shows the extent of their embarrassment in respect of the manner in which farmers have been treated by the Government.  Following the march, the Minister came out of hiding and appeared on both local and national radio to try to defend the cuts.  While I heard the Minister on Monday morning speaking on Clare FM, it was a pity he did not debate the issues with Padraig Walshe, who came on immediately after the Minister went off the air.  However, the Minister did not wish to do so because he could not defend the cuts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_1758">The facts are that 3,752 suckler farmers in County Clare will lose an average of €713 each from the suckler welfare scheme.  A total of 2,500 farmers will lose €1,000 each because of the disadvantaged area cuts.  That amounts to €5 million from County Clare alone because two schemes were cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">The loss of installation aid was a major blow to young farmers, many of whom had decided to take up farming full-time as a result of the decline in the construction industry.  That once-off payment of €15,000 was a tremendous help to many young farmers, particularly for legal fees on land transfer.  The cuts to the early retirement scheme was another major blow to young farmers because this scheme was an incentive to elderly farmers to transfer their land to younger farmers.  I believe the Minister is completely out of touch with rural Ireland.  Instead of encouraging young farmers back to the land, he is driving them to emigrate to Australia and elsewhere.  I refer to the cuts in two schemes alone.  Farmers still will be obliged to pay the 1% levy on gross income before capital allowances, as well as costs pertaining to health, education, school transport fees, VAT and fuel increases, to name a few.  How could the Minister allow these draconian cuts in his Department?  Has he a voice at the Cabinet table?</p>
          <p eId="para_1760">The IFA president stated on Sunday last that farmers will not go away.  Farmers will not shy away from vicious attacks on their livelihoods.  I ask the Minister to listen to rural Ireland.  I ask him to listen to some of the Fianna Fáil councillors who attended the march on Sunday last.  They were not happy punters after their meeting in Tullamore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">US President elect Barack Obama stated during his campaign:  "A good compromise ... is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music.  Everybody can recognise it".  I urge the Minister to compromise.  He can do a U-turn.  His colleagues have done so on other issues in this hastily arranged budget.  He should be recognised as a Minister who defended the farming communities, not as one who sold out on rural Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_753">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_1762">I compliment Deputy Creed on bringing this important motion to the House.  The motion focuses on the cutbacks being imposed by the Government on the agriculture sector.  These cutbacks are short-sighted and they have provoked widespread opposition in rural Ireland, an opposition well dramatised by the presence this week of a few quality sheep from the Ox Mountains in Sligo outside the main entrance to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
          <p eId="para_1763">Farmers were disproportionately targeted in the budget.  Instead of giving them a new lease of life, the Minister has ensured that agriculture suffered some of the most significant cuts in the budget.  As a result of these cutbacks, many farmers, in particular low income farmers in the west, will not be able to make a living from farming.  The future of this crucial indigenous sector has been thrown into disarray by cutting out key incentives to attract young farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">The early retirement scheme has been scrapped.  The purpose of this scheme was to support farmers who decide to cease their agricultural activity for the purpose of transferring holdings to younger farmers.  With the suspension of the scheme farmers who wish to pass on the family farm and avail of this early retirement option are now inhibited from doing so.  The decision to halt this scheme indefinitely places a serious question over the future of farming in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1765">The young farmers' installation aid scheme has also been scrapped.  This scheme was introduced as an aid to young farmers to become established in farming.  Now the €15,000 incentive to young farmers entering the sector is gone.  This scheme is one of the few ways in which the Government can assist farmers without having to get clearance from the EU as it does not constitute a state aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1766">The disadvantaged area scheme has been cut back.  This scheme was designed to provide support for farmers in less favoured areas to compensate for additional costs and income foregone related to maintaining agricultural production in these areas.  The scheme benefits a large number of farmers in the north west.  It contributes in a practical way to the maintenance of the countryside, the protection of the rural environment and the maintenance of a viable rural society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767">Disadvantage area payments are made to 1,155 farmers in Sligo and 1.058 in Leitrim.  Under the suckler cow welfare scheme, there are 2,168 farmers in Sligo and 2,127 in Leitrim.  These cuts follow on from the suspension of the farm improvement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1768">With regard to the sheep sector, farmers are telling the Minister that he has gone back on his clear commitment to allocate the money, secured from the EU, for a sheep maintenance grant.  Farmers' leaders want the Minister to confirm that the unused single payment funds will be delivered in full to the sheep sector.  I support this demand by farmers.  In this sector there are obvious problems of reducing flocks and pressure on the prices farmers get for their lamb and sheep leading to their falling incomes.  Some producers are leaving the sector, which needs help now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769">The cutbacks in the agriculture sector will result in a decline of 10% to 20% in farm incomes.  These cutbacks will have a serious impact on the smaller farmers in the most disadvantaged areas of the north west.  The livelihoods of thousands of farmers from the west have now been put in jeopardy by the Government.  Taking this money out of the rural economy will have knock-on effects in the loss of on-farm and off-farm jobs with little or no possibility of those losing their jobs getting a job elsewhere.  These cutbacks will drive existing part-time farmers out of business and drive those struggling to remain full time in the business into a marginal standard of living.</p>

          <p eId="para_1770">Everybody including farmers accepts that difficult decisions needed to be made to balance the books in the budget, but this is an issue of equity and fairness.  The budget published in October specifically targets farmers, especially young and small farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">By cutting the disadvantaged area payments, it is targeting the most marginal land in the country and as a result, the most vulnerable farmers.  Some 1,600 farmers throughout County Roscommon will lose on average €1,500 in this measure alone.  A thousand farmers in County Leitrim will lose on average €1,300 on the disadvantaged area payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">The cuts in the early retirement scheme, the installation aid, the suckler cow scheme and the farm waste management grant send a clear message that as far as the Government is concerned there is no future in agriculture and the only choice for young people interested in farming is to take the boat, or take the plane and be taxed, and leave the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">The agricultural cuts announced in the budget are only part of the rural dirty dozen of cuts that impact on education, on rural development and on the elderly.  Some have suggested that the modulation cuts, about which the Minister gave himself a clap on the back in Brussels, should be used to subvent this.  They should not be used for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">This is about equity and fairness.  The agricultural community has been penalised more than any other sector in the Irish economy and the funding that has been made available because of the penalty put on farmers on the single farm payment must be ringfenced for the sheep sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1775">There is a deficit in sheep meat within the European Union.  Deputy Sargent, the Green Party Minister of State, would talk about food miles and about the carbon cost in bringing food the whole way around the world.  Here is a way that we can solve that problem.  Instead of bringing sheep meat from New Zealand, let us produce it here in Ireland and let us support Irish farmers to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">The reality is the budget cuts take €8.5 million out of the local economy in Roscommon and Leitrim.  This is money that will cut the fabric of rural Ireland and cut the backbone out of the local economy.  At present, we are losing 78 jobs a week since the Taoiseach took over the running of the Government, and that number will increase with the cutbacks that have been announced in the budget.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1777">I thank Deputy Creed, and my colleagues for sharing time on this important agricultural motion.  We are living in a different economic era.  We know there is very little money in the country.  In view of Deputy Cowen's recession, as Minister for Finance for four years and as Taoiseach, we are brought to the point where we must look at savings to be made.  We in Fine Gael are not immune to that fact, but we object to the productive sector of the economy being allowed to be further eroded and the financial viability of job creation in the future, whether in manufacturing, agriculture or the food industry, being called into question.  This is not the way to address our problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">The economic climate is so serious and so consequential on the decisions made by the previous Government to increase our cost base so tragically that it is allowing farmers and those in the food industry to be consequential people in rural Ireland.  There is no point in having Deputy Ó Cuív as Minister for rural development dispensing money for rural assist schemes if there are people already in the food industry in agriculture who are gainfully employed and want to remain so.  Agriculture was always the old reliable for rural survival and job creation in rural Ireland.  The Government wants to curtail incomes to farmers and new entrants into our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779">The budget has been changed already on three occasions — on health, social welfare and the income levy.  I can tell the Minister where he can get money.  There are five sets of inspectors criss-crossing Ireland carrying out inspections on farms under the nitrates directive and other issues.  Cut their expenses and those post immediately.</p>

I fear the damage that has already been done to the agricultural sector, which will take years to repair, is only the first stage on a slippery slope of abandoning those who derive their income from the land of our country.  My biggest fear is that it is the first step in a litany of damage that the Minister will do to this vital sector of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1812">The Minister, who is only a few wet months in the job, will not even admit that it is wet and extend the time for the farm waste management scheme to be completed.  He allowed this budget to attack the young, the elderly and those on low incomes in the agricultural sector even though he is charged on behalf of the people with protecting and securing its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1813">The provisions in this budget can only be described as a slash and burn policy for the agricultural sector.  Slash the ambitions of young people planning a lifetime in farming, slash a quarter of the income of small farmers and burn the hopes of those who want to take it easy at the end of their working lives.

          <p eId="para_1817">Why has the Minister abolished the farm retirement scheme, which encouraged those coming to the end of their working lives to make way for the new young and energetic farmers who will improve productivity?  If this Government's policy is indeed to invest in the economy, where are the investments in agriculture in this budget?  The investment programmes have been taken away and bureaucratic blockages have been erected.  The Minister is trying to blame Brussels when all he had to do was copy his counterpart in Northern Ireland by lifting the telephone to request an extension to the scheme now being closed on 31 December.  He has done nothing to improve the lot of the farmer or the fisherman, and he has done nothing for the food sector or food consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1818">We are approaching the Christmas break and I suggest that it is time for the Minister and his two Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Sargent, to go back to their offices and seriously consider what they can do to improve the future of the agricultural sector and alleviate the plight of farmers, some of whom have been camping outside the Department's doors for the past several days.  They do not even have the guts to meet with the sheep farmers to whom they promised €28 million before the last election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1819">If the Minister cannot come back in the new year with a new deal for farmers, perhaps it is time that he pulled the curtains and got off the stage because all that can be said thus far of his tenure in Agriculture House is — a lot of damage done; do not do more.</p>

          <p eId="para_1820">When the archives dating back to the 12th century were destroyed in the Four Courts in 1922, Winston Churchill wrote to Michael Collins.  He stated, "800 years of Ireland's history may be blown to the four corners of the earth but the title deeds of Ireland are safe".</p>
          <p eId="para_1821">How many title deeds of farms throughout Ireland are safe after this budget, with its savage cuts imposed on the farming community and the younger and not so young farmers?  These savage cuts are best illustrated by the Macra na Feirme example of a young farmer taking over the farm from retired parents.  The cuts he or she would experience are savage — there is €15,000 of installation aid, €15,000 from the early retirement scheme and €1,055 from the disadvantaged area scheme.  The suckler scheme is cut by €2,400, with the total loss of income for one year of €33,455.  It is savage; could any other sector of the community afford such a cutback?  If this does not put such farmers out of business, what does it attempt to do?  This is even before we mention the 1% income levy and the abolition of the farm improvement grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1822">A close neighbour of mine from north Tipperary was here last night frothing from the mouth — he is not here tonight — and he told me that he had supported Fianna Fáil all his life.  His reward for doing so was for the Government to pick his pocket to the tune of €165,000, as he was preparing to hand over his farm to his son and take retirement.  That is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1823">The current state of the farm retirement scheme and installation aid amounts to broken promises.  They were agreed under social partnership for six years and are included in the rural development programme for 2007 to 2013.  CAP reform, with reluctant agreement from the farming community, was accepted to 2013 but that is another broken agreement.  The Government has left sheep farmers out in the cold coming up to Christmas because it will not pay out EU funds to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1824">It is one broken promise after another.  How in the name of God can the Minister expect the people to believe a word from his mouth when he tells us this is a temporary measure?  It is no wonder the Lisbon treaty referendum was lost and the people are disillusioned with the Government.  These schemes represent tremendous value for money and have the potential to create 750 to 800 jobs at a cost of less than €9,000 per job.  This can be compared with the €90,000 it costs to create one IDA job here.  The Government should be ashamed of itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1825">The passion for agriculture was best demonstrated by John B. Keane in <i>The Field</i>, written in 1965.  There is much similarity between the play and what is happening today.  The play had the characters of the Bull, his son Tadhg and the Bird O’Donnell.  There are many like Bird O’Donnell on the Government benches who are urging on this dastardly deed on farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1835">We all know there is an economic crisis but the farming community is more than willing to carry its fair share of the burden and make its fair share of payments.  With regard to the rest of the population, we had a wage agreement several weeks ago, and many hundreds of thousands of people will get 6% in pay increases over the next two years but the only bloc of people who will not get 6% extra — they will have 6%, 10% or 12% in a reduction — is the farming and agricultural community.  They are the backbone of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1836">I come from a county which has lost 12,000 industrial jobs in the recent years.  The tourism industry is at a low ebb and the fishing industry is almost non-existent.  I need not go into the problems of the construction industry.  We depend on farming and agriculture more than ever before, yet the people are being treated in this way in this budget.  The budget allowed the Minister of Finance and the Government to put their fists into the pocket of every farmer and take out thousands of euro.  The more disadvantaged the area, the more the Government took from the farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">Installation aid was introduced by a former colleague, Austin Deasy, way back in 1983 and 1984.  Even during the dark days of economic crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, the scheme was always maintained.  It was very progressive and enabled new blood to come in to energise agriculture, increase production and supply food and income for many people.  The same applied to the retirement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1838">I know I am short of time.  I appeal to the Minister — who is from the north west and understands the west of Ireland — to consider, as has been articulated by my colleagues, the serious crisis facing the hill sheep farmers.  If he does nothing else, will the Minister please pay them the premium before the week is out?</p>

As Deputy McGinley has said, they are prepared, as they always have been, to shoulder their fair share of the burden.

          <p eId="para_1844">The Minister has tabled an amendment that fails to address the three critical issues before the House — the installation aid scheme, the early retirement scheme and disadvantaged area payments.  If the Minister wants a debate on the CAP health check in the House, I will have it any day.  If he wants to come in to defend the 5% increased modulation, we will debate it or consider how it should be spent.  If he wants to come to the House to debate the crisis in the dairy industry that will not just put dairy farmers out of business but which threatens the viability of co-operatives and plcs involved in processing milk, I would welcome such a discussion.  The Minister should not abuse parliamentary privilege by tabling a motion that fails to address the issues before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1845">Like all my colleagues I have attended meetings in Blarney, Dunmanway and other public meetings organised by Macra na Feirme in Tullamore.  I have witnessed the anger of farmers, who acknowledge the difficult times and are quite prepared to shoulder their fair share.  I heard one farmer state that if the Government had put 2% on the top rate of tax it would have been fine because it would have been a measure reaching across the board and would have affected everybody.  The Government's action has involved a disproportionate impact on the most marginal of farmers, who are by and large involved in marginal enterprises.  These include the sheep and beef sector in particular, involving the cattle and sheep men of the west of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1846">Considering the electoral history of Fianna Fáil in the west of Ireland, such people have been significant supporters of the party, but they have been the hardest hit by what the Government has proposed in this amendment.  We recognise the very difficult times being experienced by the country and we were a lone voice for many years calling for frugality and restraint with taxpayers' money in seeking public service reform in the benchmarking area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847">We regret that the Government did not heed those warnings preached alone on this side of the House for many years.  We acknowledge the serious crisis facing many people now losing their jobs.  That is why we have published a different and detailed budgetary framework that will finance the reintroduction of installation aid and the early retirement scheme, as well as reversing the cuts in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1848">I appeal to my colleagues on the Government benches who represent rural constituencies to ask themselves if what they are voting for tonight is right for the agriculture industry.  We are at a crossroads and many young people who want to enter farming have been dealt a serious psychological blow.  Meanwhile, many years of planning by elderly people who want to retire from farming have been devastated.  If there was a free vote in the House, this motion would be unanimously backed by Members from all sides.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil Members to trust their better judgment on this issue and support the motion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_2133">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I seek the assistance of the Minister on behalf of patients in the mid-west region in freeing up what appears to be a logjam in the roll-out of services for patients with cystic fibrosis, CF, in particular at Limerick Regional Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_2134">The Minister will be aware that the recommendations of the national working group on CF services were accepted.  I understand €559,000 was set aside to upgrade services for CF patients.  The Minister may be aware that 77 children and 46 adults are currently being treated at the Limerick Regional Hospital.  Funding for CF services was allocated by the Health Service Executive following the Pollock report on CF services in 2006.  Nationally, €4.8 million was provided, of which €2,072 million has been set aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_2135">As I stated, €559,000 was allocated directly to Limerick Regional Hospital to fund a number of positions.  Two of the urgently required positions have not yet been filled, namely, an adult respiratory consultant with an interest in CF and a paediatric respiratory consultant with an interest in CF.  The concern of patients in the region is to identify where that funding is and why these services have not been rolled out.  The funding, as I understand it, was to support the cost of an additional eight staff, identified for the adult and paediatric CF services at the Dooradoyle facility.  Included in the eight additional staff were two consultant posts, a consultant physician for adult services with a special interest in cystic fibrosis and a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in cystic fibrosis.  That is the minimum required to provide the type of services needed for patients in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_2136">There has been a considerable outcry during the past couple of years in regard to the treatment of individuals with cystic fibrosis and there was some movement by Government in this regard, in particular in regard to services to be delivered at St. Vincent's Hospital on the east coast.  It is only right and fitting — I know the Government and Minister is committed to this — that the type of facilities available on the east coast are made available to people from the mid-west region who have cystic fibrosis.  While the money for this has been set aside, services have not to date been rolled out.  It is incumbent on the Minister and her Department to use their good offices, taking into account the assistance from the HSE, to move this forward without any further procrastination or delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_2137">While a relatively good service is provided in the paediatric area, there is need for an extra consultant.  There is little service available to adults suffering from CF, which is a progressive illness.  Clearly, there is a requirement to ensure continuity of service in respect of children moving from the paediatric service to the adult service.  I understand also that a physiotherapist is required in the adult section.  Anybody who understands CF knows that physio is the cornerstone of therapy to be delivered to patients suffering from that condition.  It is absolutely necessary that these services are rolled out without delay, that the positions are advertised and that appointments are made as quickly as possible so that the same degree of service as is available on the east coast can be delivered in the mid-west region.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryWallace" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_804">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
          <p eId="para_2138">I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_2139">The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned Dr. Ronnie Pollock to review existing hospital services for cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards.  The report, which was published in 2005, provided an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients.  Following publication of the Pollock report, the Health Service Executive established a working group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The remit of the group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition, was to review the configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2140">In recognition of the need to improve services for these patients, the Minister for Health and Children identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority.  As Deputy Dooley stated, additional funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive in 2006 and 2007 to develop these services.  The HSE has advised that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including Limerick Regional Hospital and eight other hospitals.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally, including staff for the mid-west region.  The services in place for cystic fibrosis patients in the mid-west region were built up over a number of years, as acknowledged in the Pollock report.</p>
          <p eId="para_2141">The current adult cystic fibrosis service for the mid-western region is provided at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick by two consultant respiratory physicians providing inpatient and outpatient services.  The cystic fibrosis service for children is provided by a consultant paediatrician and involves both inpatient and outpatient services.  Two nurse specialists currently cover both the paediatric and adult cystic fibrosis services.  Adult and paediatric cystic fibrosis services are also supported by a dedicated team, which includes a social worker, a dietician, a physiotherapist and a pharmacist.</p>
          <p eId="para_2142">The Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, provides three dedicated rooms for adult cystic fibrosis patients.  These rooms may be used for other patients if not required for cystic fibrosis patients.  Paediatric cystic fibrosis patients are accommodated in the paediatric unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_2143">With regard to additional clinical posts mentioned by Deputy Dooley, eight and a half additional clinical posts have been approved to enhance the adult and paediatric cystic fibrosis service in the mid-west.  Four of these posts are now in place and recruitment arrangements for the remainder are in train.  This includes the two additional consultant appointments the Deputy referred to, which are proceeding through the recruitment stages.  Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the recruitment process, the remaining appointees for the mid-west are expected to take up posts in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_2144">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  The Minister is confident that these developments will significantly enhance the level of service provided for persons with cystic fibrosis in the HSE mid-western area.</p>

          <heading>Services for People with Disabilities.</heading>
          <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_805">
            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_2145">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this issue again, having had the opportunity to raise it during the past 12 months.  It is an extremely important issue to a number of people.  I have given a commitment to a number of mothers in particular who have adult children over 16 years of age with an intellectual disability who cannot get routine dental treatment because it is required under general anaesthetic.  This issue is particular to the Cork region.  It is a distressing situation that has arisen for the parents, who are the carers of these adult children, and for the adult children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">The problem is that for a simple procedure such as a filling or for even a scale and polish adults with intellectual disabilities in some cases require a general anaesthetic.  It is a day procedure but it must be done under strict criteria, which we all accept.  They have been referred by their dentist or general practitioner to the Cork University Dental Hospital for these procedures, the waiting list for which is mounting and is now more than two years.  In the period I have been raising this issue, one or two of these adults have been dealt with as an emergency case in Tralee, but that is not satisfactory.  It does not address the ongoing problem and the fact that the waiting list for these procedures is mounting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">I tabled a question on this issue to the Minister in June of this year to which I received a reply from the HSE.  I was told in June that the HSE has made provisional agreement with the Cork University Hospital anaesthesia and day treatment departments to commence an additional two treatment sessions per month for adults with special needs beginning in September 2008.  This will be provided by HSE staff in collaboration with the dental school and the service will increase capacity, reduce existing waiting lists and manage referrals.  That reply in June was welcome news.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">In November I again raised this question and was told that progress had been made, nevertheless, no service has been provided.  The HSE in north Cork recruited a senior dentist in July 2008.  He commenced in September and is skilled and experienced in the delivery of dental services to adults with an intellectual disability under general anaesthetic.  He is currently working on preparing the protocols, policies and procedures to commence this service and discussions are ongoing with Cork University Hospital with an anticipated starting date of early December 2008, which is this week.  I was contacted yesterday by two parents of adult children who are in this position and no service has been provided for them.  The dentist and anaesthetist are in place but there are no beds available.  Therefore, there is no provision again in December for these adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">I cried with a parent as she told me on the telephone of her daughter who needs a filling in her front tooth.  Her tooth is deteriorating and it will get to the stage where she will push her tongue against her broken tooth and get a crack in her tongue and will end up with untold problems.  That is a small issue, but it must be dealt with.  It is only one of the stories of all these adults provision for whom is being neglected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">The Minister of State will probably tell me this is a matter for the HSE, but it is matter for this House and for those of us who have been elected to represent these people.  It is a matter for the Department of Health and Children which has decided policy in this area, namely, that these people will be given the necessary dental treatment, yet it is not happening on the ground.  It is a tragic situation that needs to be addressed.  We are getting there slowly, but we cannot close the circle to ensure that these people receive the necessary dental treatments that should be available to them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryWallace" eId="spk_806" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_2151">I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue raised by Deputy Clune.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Haughey provided the Deputy with information on this issue earlier this year and I am happy to be to a position to update this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">I would like to explain the current position.  In January 2007 a decision was taken by Cork University Dental School not to accept any further referrals to its existing waiting list for adult special needs patients who required treatment under general anaesthetic.  The services in question in the Cork University Dental School were provided under an arrangement with the HSE.  This decision was taken after considering a number of factors, including the length of time for patients on the current waiting list and the capacity of the current services at Cork University Dental School.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">In addition to these factors, there were also concerns regarding the appropriateness of the facilities in regard to the treatment of both adult and child patients in a shared treatment environment and the lack of a consultant specialist for adults within the dental school.  After considering all these factors, a decision was taken to cease services and no new referrals were added to the list from January 2007.  I would like to point out that patients who were already on the waiting list continue to be treated and will receive all the dental treatment involving general anaesthetic that has been prescribed for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">The Minister is now informed by the HSE in Cork that it has recruited a dentist with experience in the delivery of dental services to adults with special needs who require general anaesthetic.  This dentist will also provide a service to all clients referred from both voluntary and statutory sources in the greater Cork area, including the city and county.  As this service needs to be provided in an acute hospital setting, the HSE is currently negotiating with Cork University Hospital and the dental school to reconfigure existing theatre sessions in order to accommodate this new service development.  Discussions in regard to these theatre sessions are ongoing and the HSE anticipates that it will be in a position to commence services as soon as the theatre capacity is made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">The HSE is aware of those patients who have been unable since January 2007 to access services at the Cork University Dental School and will contact them in due course regarding treatment when the new arrangements are in place.  In the interim period while these arrangements are being finalised, the UCC Dental School will continue to provide emergency dental care to adults with special needs and a limited service is also provided to adults with special needs by HSE dental staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">On a broader issue, I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Health and Children is in the final stages of developing a new national oral health policy.  This new policy, the first such policy in 13 years, has been undertaken by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the HSE.  Among the matters that have been examined are service delivery issues such as the availability of dental and oral health care services for people with special needs.  In this regard, officials in the Department of Health and Children have met a number of groups who work in the area of special needs dentistry to ascertain their views on recommendations for improving oral health services to people with disabilities.  These groups include the Irish Society for Disability and Oral Health and a group of principal dental surgeons in the HSE who have responsibility for special needs dentistry.</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">In addition to meeting these groups, the Department of Health and Children has also sought the views of various organisations who work with people with disabilities.  As a result of these meetings and consultations, the Department of Health and Children intends to bring forward a series of recommendations to improve the position of dental and oral health services to people with special needs in its forthcoming national oral health policy report, which will be available shortly.</p>

          <heading>Pension Provisions.</heading>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_807">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_2158">Last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> carried a front page story of a leaked memo from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, to Government that there is a potential deficit on certain private sector pension funds of between €20 billion and €30 billion; that the majority of defined benefit pension schemes are probably in deficit because of the fall in the value of equities and that many pension schemes are at risk of being wound up.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">As there are approximately 250,000 employees and 90,000 pensioners in defined pension schemes, it is understandable that the leaking of the memo caused grave concern to workers and pensioners in such schemes.  The subsequent statements by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, in media interviews did little to allay fears.  The Minister's suggestion that people would always have the State pension to fall back on anyway was insensitive to say the least.  During its 11-year reign in power, Fianna Fáil has continually talked about pension reform but done nothing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">In terms of the immediate crisis facing pension schemes, a number of suggestions have been made by the Minister and some of her colleagues, among others.  One suggestion was to extend the period by up to two years on the requirement to purchase an annuity for people about to retire.  The second was a relaxation of the current rules governing defined benefit schemes to allow a breathing space in the context of depressed equity markets.  Is it the Government's intention to implement either of those two proposals to give some relief and space for people coming of pension age at present and funds that may have particular short-term difficulties?</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The Government's failure to reform pensions is on a par with the model of regulation that it chose for the banks — regulation with a light touch, which has left many workers dangerously exposed to their pensions losing value.  The Government has offered generous tax breaks for investments in pensions.  However, for many ordinary workers on modest wages in the private sector, much of the tax relief has been eaten up by the high level of charges the Government has allowed for pension schemes in Ireland, unlike in other European countries.  Prudent fund management would dictate that as workers approach retirement age, their funds should be invested in less risky investments such as Government-backed bonds.  However, since Charlie McCreevy's time, the Government has been encouraging and permitting pension funds to invest more and more in equities.  While this was a way of boosting profits while stock markets were running high, it now leaves many coming up to retirement age perilously exposed to the collapse in stock market prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">The Government can be accused of encouraging both pensioners and pension funds, through the attractiveness of tax breaks, to take unnecessary risks.  Now that, unfortunately, those risks have materialised, it is extraordinarily high handed of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to wash her hands of the issue and casually remark that "most of these people would have a State pension — €230.30 per week — and the State pension is a good guarantee to fall back on".  That smacks of Marie Antoinette and her advice to the peasantry of pre-revolutionary France, "Let them eat cake".</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">I want the Government to put on record tonight what concrete proposals it has to protect the tens of thousands of workers affected.  We need a national solution to the problem.  People need a pension for their retirement.  It is right for the Government to encourage people to save and invest wisely for their retirement but the Government has created extraordinarily attractive schemes for the high rollers and the multimillionaires to invest in pension funds but, unfortunately, many middle income workers have been left far behind the high rollers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">The time for Government PR, Green Papers, discussion documents and task forces is long past.  We need a Pensions Ombudsman with much greater powers to protect workers in schemes.  We need an immediate response from Government to address the difficult issues facing people due to retire in the short term, and those pension funds that the Minister has indicated in her memo are at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">I welcome the fact that the Minister is in the House tonight because it is important that she put some positive statements on the record and tell us whether the Government will permit the extra two years for the purchase of annuities.  Will the Minister provide an active mechanism for pension funds to vary some of the conditions in the context of the current depressed equities market?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_808">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2166">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue in the House because the memo that was leaked and covered in the newspapers on Sunday did have the effect of causing unease among a huge number of people even though many would have known that pension funds are investment funds and the way the markets have gone would affect the financial status of the funds.  I set out to allay people's fears in subsequent media interviews by pointing out that no pension fund has gone bust and no pensioner has been left without a pension.  However, we know there are some who are bound to experience difficulties given the current state of the market.  It is true that those people who are many years away from receiving a pension will have an opportunity to allow their funds to build back up when the markets turn, as they will.  I appreciate the fact that many people are in pension schemes and those coming close to retirement feel somewhat uneasy about the information that was leaked.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">The overall number of active defined benefit schemes registered with the Pensions Board at the end of 2007 was 1,319.  The number of active defined contribution schemes was 98,483.  The active membership of those schemes at that time was 530,933 and 269,465, respectively.  That is a total of approximately 800,000 people who are involved in pension funds of one kind or another.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">The Pensions Act provides for a minimum funding standard which defined benefit pension schemes must meet on an ongoing basis.  Generally speaking, the standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the funding standard the sponsors-trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years.  In certain circumstances the Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In 2007, 81% of defined benefit schemes reporting to the Pensions Board passed the funding standard.  Most of those schemes that failed the test had a funding proposal in place.  It is expected that the number of schemes failing the funding standard will increase significantly in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">Estimates suggest that defined benefit pension schemes have sustained approximately €20 billion of investment losses this year.  While it is expected that the number of schemes failing the standard will increase sharply as a result of current market conditions, the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out end of year actuarial assessments and report the results to the Pensions Board, as required under the Pensions Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">In recognition of the current market difficulties and the difficult decisions that pension schemes will face, the Government has put in place a number of short-term measures to ease the pressure on schemes.  It has been agreed with the Pensions Board that an additional six months will be allowed for trustees to prepare funding proposals.  That will mean schemes will have 18 months to review the situation with sponsoring employers and formulate proposals for recovery.  Those actions are being taken to alleviate the current situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">Members of defined contribution schemes have also been exposed to investment losses.  In such schemes the risk is borne in full by the member.  Many of those schemes are relatively immature and for many people there will be adequate time to recoup some or all of the losses that have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">There are particular concerns for those who may be at, or close to, retirement.  Good practice would suggest a conservative approach to investments in the last number of years before retirement but anecdotal evidence suggests that may not have been applied in some cases.  Members of defined contribution schemes are required to purchase an annuity at the point of retirement.  In the current environment, those scheme members could realise a significant loss in the value of their pension fund.  In the circumstances, the Department of Finance is currently working out the details on how such scheme members could avail of a period of up to two years to purchase an annuity.  There is, of course, the risk that those availing of the deferment option could sustain further losses and that will be clearly outlined in guidance notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">The Government is working with the Pensions Board, representative organisations and the social partners to find ways to ease the pressure on schemes by striking a balance between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need to ensure short-term security of accrued benefits.  As outlined, it has taken some short-term measures in this area.  The long-term response is being considered in the context of the Green Paper on pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the overall framework for pensions which the Government has indicated it will announce in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">While appreciating the concern people have about their pension funds, we recognise funds can be in difficulty because of the markets.  We are working closely with the Pensions Board and have no hard factual information to the effect that any scheme is in difficulty.  No scheme has run into difficulty to date and no one responsible therefor has indicated that this is the case.  No pensioner or prospective pensioner has lost out.  Where there were difficulties with schemes in the past, the employers made them good.  They are very willing to support those who are dependent on pensions.  We are certainly working on this issue and very much on top of it.  I allay any fears that the unfortunate leak might have aroused.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_2177">I raise this issue because there is deep concern in Fermoy about proposals made by the OPW to replace the weir in the town with a rock ramp pass.  People fear for their rowing club which some argue has been in existence since Adam was a boy.  They fear that if the weir is replaced by a rock ramp, it will have untold consequences for the water level in the River Blackwater, thus negating the amenity value of the rowing club.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">Why is the Government proceeding with this folly?  There is no justification for the project.  The OPW's flood alleviation works were sanctioned and welcomed but it is now seeking to change the weir, to which there seems to be no logic.  When I put a question to the Minister on the issue on 4 November, I was told the direction had been issued in the interests of conserving wild salmon resources and avoiding the initiation of infringement proceedings by the European Commission under the habitats directive on foot of a complaint lodged with the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">Given that the Government is seeking to adhere to the habitats directive, the people of Fermoy and I would like to know the nature of the complaint and who lodged it.  We want to know the justification for it.  If it is to ensure enough salmon can get up the river, plenty of salmon are being caught by rod on the river.  It does not require the destruction of the weir to ensure more salmon can get up the river because there is a much cheaper solution that would ensure the continuation of a fish pass without compromising the valuable amenity constituted by the rowing club in Fermoy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">We want to ensure the future viability of the rowing club.  We do not see the economic justification for the proposal in the current climate.  If the Minister of State tells me that the project is being carried out by the OPW because Fermoy Town Council cannot afford to do so, she should note that the former Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, visited the town in 2006.  Two years have passed since his visit and the project is to be hitched to an OPW flood alleviation plan, to which there is no logic to whatsoever.  The people of Fermoy cannot comprehend it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">The EU habitats directive is being used as a battering ram to carry out the project.  There is no justification for this.  If there was a complaint lodged to the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission, will the Minister of State make a copy of it available to the House in order that Members will know exactly who is behind the works?  I do not believe for one moment that the OPW is fully responsible and believe there are other mechanisms at play.  I would go so far as to say the Southern Regional Fisheries Board is the main instigator and that it is seeking to justify its position.  It will gladly sacrifice a rowing club to this end but should realise that, ultimately, as many salmon will get up the river without a rock ramp as they would if one were installed.  Hiding behind the fallacy of a habitats directive is typical of a Government which has used the European Union when it wants to push through some bad proposals.  This project will have an adverse effect on the community in Fermoy.  I ask the Government to rethink its strategy, particularly in the current economic climate.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_2182">The proposed works at Fermoy do not involve the removal or replacement of the weir but rather the essential replacement of the fish pass to permit the unheeded passage of migratory fish, as required under the habitats directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">The background to the current proposals on works at Fermoy weir is that a complaint was made to the European Commission alleging that the weir was acting as a barrier to migrating salmon which are being injured in their attempts to migrate for spawning purposes.  Salmon is one of a number of species in the River Blackwater that are protected species under the habitats directive.  The river also happens to be a designated special area of conservation</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">The Commission has indicated to officials that failure to rectify the position will result in infringement proceedings being initiated against Ireland.  This could result in very substantial fines being imposed by the European Court of Justice.  In these circumstances, the engineering section of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources investigated the matter.  Its report of July 2006 indicated that the weir acted as a barrier not only to salmon but also to other protected species, namely, lamprey and shad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">In the light of the findings of the report and the complaint to the Commission, a direction under section 116 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 was issued by the Minister to Fermoy Town Council, as owner of the weir.  The council is required to lower part of the weir, consistent with retaining sufficient depth for rowing in recognition of the amenity enjoyed by Fermoy Rowing Club, and to install a rock ramp pass in the lowered weir to facilitate fish passage.  While the optimal solution to barriers to migrating fish, purely from a fisheries conservation perspective, is to remove them, at no time was it proposed to remove the weir, nor is removal part of the current proposals.  This approach was adopted in order to protect the recognised amenity enjoyed by Fermoy Rowing Club on the River Blackwater.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">An opportunity has arisen to have the works on the weir completed alongside the first phase of a flood relief scheme for the area to be carried out by the OPW.  There are obvious efficiencies and economies associated with pursuing this course of action.  I advise the Deputy that departmental officials, at the request of Fermoy Town Council, held a public consultation in the town recently to explain the nature and purpose of the proposed works.  The Department also met representatives of Fermoy Rowing Club and its engineering adviser to discuss the proposals.  Concerns were expressed during the consultation about aspects of the proposal and a number of measures to alleviate these concerns have now been proposed.  Under the revised proposal the width of the fish pass would be decreased.  This will reduce further the extent to which upstream water levels will drop below the existing weir crest, in low flow periods to 85 millimetres, or 3.4 inches.  That is in the normal flow of a dry summer.  In a severe drought period, the drop in water levels below the existing weir crest will not exceed 175 millimetres, or 7 inches, according to the engineers.  I am advised there is deep water upstream of the weir and these projected water levels during low flow should  not give rise to any interference with the activities of the rowing club.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">The additional proposals to be designed as part of the project include the installation of a pontoon slipway, pending the building of a new slipway by the OPW, as part of phase 2 of its flood relief scheme; the removal of gravel from the river bed at the strand area where it has naturally silted up and limits rowing; with the consent of the owner the cutting back of weeds and foliage that limit the width of the river available for rowing.  These works are to be carried out by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">I am advised that the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Seán Power, hopes to hold a number of meetings to clarify whether there are any issues that have not been addressed in the revised proposals before he decides whether to proceed with the necessary works, in compliance with domestic and European law.</p>

            <p eId="para_2190">The possibility of support to the sheep sector will be considered in the light of the outcome of the recent CAP Health Check. That outcome provides that an additional amount of some €24 million annually will be available to Irish farmers from 2010 onwards. That amount may be used to target specific sectors in need of assistance and represents money that would otherwise not be available to farmers due to the complex rules surrounding the Single Farm Payment. Support may commence in 2009 by utilising funds from the National Reserve, which are expected to be in the region of €6 million to €7 million, and these will be supplemented from 2010 with the unspent Single Farm Payment funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">As I indicated following the completion of the Health Check, I will consult relevant stakeholders as to how these additional funds can best be spent. To that end I will meet with them on 16th December to consider their views and possible options.</p>

            <p eId="para_2193">The relevant EU market support measures — private storage and export refunds — assisted the sector over the last year. Ireland raised the possible re-introduction of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat in the context of a recent EU management committee for animal products. The EU Commission declined, however, to take action at this stage.

            <p eId="para_2197">I am very much aware that the future health of Ireland's agriculture sector is inextricably linked with the ability of Irish farmers to respond, in a sustainable way, to both  the challenges and the opportunities arising from changes to our climate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2201">The EU/Norway bilateral negotiations follow on from the Coastal States Negotiations which set the over all Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for certain stocks in the Northeast Atlantic in which Ireland has an interest. The key stocks for Ireland in the Coastal States discussions are Mackerel, Blue Whiting and Atlanto-Scandian Herring.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">The EU has a long-standing bilateral fisheries agreement with Norway.  The agreement is implemented through annually negotiated fisheries arrangements, which allow for the setting of total allowable catches (TACs) for joint stocks, transfers of fishing possibilities, joint technical measures, and issues related to control and enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">The annual EU-Norway consultations takes place over the autumn. The discussions  focused on:</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">the setting of TACs for jointly managed stocks in the North Sea (particularly cod, haddock, saithe, whiting, plaice and herring).</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">receipt by the EC of Arcto-Norwegian cod in the Barents Sea.  Ireland received  about 255 tonnes of this stock in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">Agreement between the EU and Norway has not been reached to date  because of the complexity of the discussions on some technical and conservation measures, namely discards. Additionally the balancing of the transfers proved challenging as the main transfer stock Blue Whiting has seen its TAC level decrease from 1,150,000 tonnes in 2008 to 543,000 tonnes in 2009.  Further negotiations is now planned for the week beginning the 8th of December.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">While from an over all perspective Ireland gains little from this agreement, we have a big interest as historically we have paid disproportionately for the balancing arrangement, as Blue Whiting, the key transfer stock is an important fishery for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">Ireland has continually maintained that the present balancing arrangement is unfair and inequitable and has sought a proportionate reduction in the level of Blue Whiting transferred. The reduction in the 2009 TAC for Blue Whiting has meant that the transfer cannot be balanced by Blue Whiting alone.  We have strongly argued that stocks of importance to Ireland, such as mackerel, can not form part of the transfer as we do not gain from the exchange of opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">I will continue to take every opportunity, as will my officials, to ensure that Ireland's interests are protected during these negotiations. We will continue to liaise closely with Industry in this regard and will actively promote positions which will give Ireland the best possible outcome in what are difficult negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2211">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels. These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">Prior to this overall review the Deputy will be aware of the measures taken in relation to the labelling of beef both at retail level and within the catering sector.   Ireland introduced regulations extending the origin labelling requirement for beef to the catering sector, thereby ensuring that origin labelling for beef covers all sales to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation. At the relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13th October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland's proposed regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables. Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables. As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</p>

            <p eId="para_2217">When Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, the Community received a very significant additional fishing resource out to the 200 mile limit.  At that time however, Ireland's fishing industry was totally underdeveloped.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">In this context, the 1976 Hague Agreement recognised the development needs of peripheral regions whose populations were heavily dependent on fishing activity.  The Hague Agreement allowed Ireland to double its 1975 catches of a number of stocks.  These target catches are called the Hague Targets.  The UK was also granted a number of Hague Targets.  The actual quotas are set for relevant stocks at the average of what the quota would have been without the Hague and the relative proportion of the Hague target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">The Hague Preferences have been a fundamental part of relative stability and have been recognised as such in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) framework since 1983.  Most recently the Hague Preferences are recognised in Council Regulation 2371/2002 following the review of the CFP in 2001/2002.    Further, the European Court (in 1998) upheld the appropriateness of the Council giving effect to the principle of relative stability through the application of the allocation keys together with the operation of the Hague Preference to take account of the special needs of Ireland and the northern part of the United Kingdom.    At the Fisheries Council, each December, Ireland has consistently, and successfully, argued that Relative Stability has therefore to be applied taking due account of the prior Hague Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">There is, however, strong opposition to the application of the Hague Preferences from certain Member States and the European Court judgment of 1998 does give discretion on their application to the Council.   It is important to be aware that with reduced Total Allowable Catches in recent years, the impact of the application of the Hague Preferences is increasing both for Ireland which gets increased quotas and for other Member States whose quotas reduce.  We are likely to face significant opposition to their application at Council this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">I remain of the view that the invocation of the Hague Preference continues to constitute an essential part of the system of relative stability as applied under the CFP, and will look to the Commission and Council to continue to respect invocations of the Hague Preference at this December Fisheries Council.  Going forward, I am also committed to the continuation and strengthening of the Hague Preferences in the CFP legal framework in the planned review which must be completed by 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2223">I have noted the contents of Teagasc's recently published medium-term outlook, which analyses prospects for the period 2008 to 2017. The findings are a reflection of the challenging environment facing the agriculture sector over the period. The dairy sector is not immune from these challenges. However, it is the manner in which we and the whole industry respond to these challenges that will determine whether the predictions prove to be accurate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The current environment is a volatile one. High milk prices in 2007 led to greater supply and demand pressures in the marketplace, and these, combined with the effects of the global economic downturn, have put significant downward pressure on prices in 2008.  However, policy needs to be driven by a consideration of the long-term outlook rather than short-term volatility. In this regard prospects are generally very positive, with a sustained increase in global demand for dairy products anticipated over the next decade and beyond. Ireland needs to position itself to take advantage of the opportunities presented by such developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">The Government's strategy has been a three-pronged one. The first element has been the implementation of the €100 million Dairy Investment Fund aimed at stimulating the necessary investment at processing level to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the industry. The second has been the introduction of the Milk Quota Trading Scheme, which has brought a more open market approach to the transfer of milk quota and has ensured that larger volumes of quota than ever before are now getting into the hands of active, committed milk producers. The final element was delivered recently when I successfully concluded negotiations on the Health Check of the 2003 CAP reform. These delivered an outstanding outcome for the dairy sector in the form of substantial milk quota increases and the retention of the market management measures of key importance to Ireland. Most significantly, the outcome has provided a greater degree of policy certainty for the industry going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">Running parallel to these developments has been the latest round of WTO negotiations, which concluded unsuccessfully in Geneva in July. The Government has consistently voiced its concern that any WTO deal should be a balanced one, and I took every opportunity in Geneva to again raise our strong concerns about the agriculture proposals in particular. It remains to be seen when and in what direction the talks will now move, but my efforts will at all times be focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Irish agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">Notwithstanding the WTO uncertainty, I believe the greater policy clarity at EU level means that it is now time to consider how best to exploit Ireland's milk production potential in order to secure the maximum possible long-term advantage for the dairy sector. To this end I have recently announced my intention to convene a Dairy Forum, which will consider, through consultation with the industry at producer and processor level, the important next steps on the road to making the Irish dairy sector the most competitive and efficient possible, while retaining as many people active in farming as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2229">Ireland has a very important position as custodian of some of the largest and richest fishing waters within the EU but also in our location on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Ireland continues to maintain high standards in the enforcement of regulations within the Exclusive Fisheries Zone using the resources of the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">The systems for dealing with infringements of the Common Fisheries Policy vary greatly from Member State to Member State and useful comparisons are not easily drawn.  Many continental legal systems are different to Ireland's and lend themselves to an administrative fines and penalties structure.  Previous advice from the Attorney-General in this regard indicated that under the Irish legal system the types of penalties which Ireland is obliged to apply under the Common Fisheries Policy would be viewed as criminal in nature and therefore could only be administered by the courts by virtue of Articles 34, 37 and 38 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006  the position is that all sanctions are purely financial in nature. The Act simply sets down the maximum fines that may be applied.  No minimum fine is set and it is a matter for a Judge, taking into account the specific case, to determine the actual fine levied.  The Act also applied for the first time a scaled approach to setting maximum fines whereby the maximum fines set for smaller vessels are less than for larger vessels.  In that respect the 2006 Act sought to guarantee a degree of proportionality for fines based on vessel size, a factor which did not exist in the previous legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">Administrative fines for fisheries offences could be introduced in Ireland if the infringements and appropriate sanctions were set down in European law.  I welcome new proposals which have been brought forward by the EU Commission with regard to introducing a new overall control regulatory framework.  These proposals will be examined carefully, including from a legal perspective, to consider if their provisions will support the introduction of administrative sanctions in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">We have always argued that control levels need to be raised across the EU if we are to protect the future of stocks in all community waters and fishing communities throughout the community who are wholly dependent on those stocks.   It is clearly in the interests of the Irish fishing industry and fishing communities that there is strong and effective implementation of the quotas and other conservation measures on all fishing vessels fishing on stocks in our zone.  I am committed to this in the interest of our fishermen and consequently welcome this proposal for a new control and inspection regulation, including efforts to introduce a harmonised system of sanctions.</p>

The amalgamation of the promotion and market development functions of BIM with Bord Bia,  will enable one single agency to manage Ireland's food and drink marketing effort on domestic and international markets.

            <p eId="para_2240">The very poor state of many whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet is clearly reflected in the decreases in annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quota allocations that Ireland receives and in the landings of the fishing fleet over the past decade. The levels of TAC and ultimately quotas for Ireland are determined each year at the December Fisheries Council following negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission. This process for 2009 has already begun in earnest with the publication of the Commission's proposals which will be subject of detailed and protracted discussions over the coming weeks. This Commission proposal sets out cuts in many of the stocks of economic importance to our fleet and also envisages other measures which will adversely impact on our fishing industry, including a proposed closure for the whitefish fleet off the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_2241">However, not all stocks are subject to decreases in TACs with the mackerel TAC going up by 33% from 456,000 tonnes in 2008 to 605,000 tonnes in 2009. This will result in the net Irish quota (after deductions for the payback for undeclared Scottish landings) going from approx 45,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes.  However, this TAC increase remains to be formally agreed and must be protected against any proposal that a part would be transferred to Norway in the EU/ Norway negotiations which are currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2242">This hugely significant increase is the reward for Irish fishermen adopting tough responsible fishing practices for this stock. In value terms using an estimated price per tonne of €1,200, this results in an increase of over €20m to the Pelagic fishing sector in 2009 (from €54m to €74.4m).</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">Notwithstanding the good news on mackerel, I am concerned with the level of cuts proposed for the whitefish stocks, the proposed closure in the north west and other measures proposed and their socio economic impact on fishermen and fishing communities. I can assure the deputy that I am actively engaged, as are my officials, in delivering the best possible deal for Ireland and there will be a lot of long days and late nights in the upcoming negotiations before a settlement is reached on the final package of measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">The reality is however, that we will experience cuts in some stocks though the actual level of these cuts has yet to be determined.   In that regard I do expect that the downwards rebalancing of our whitefish fleet fishing capacity as a result of the current decommissioning scheme, which is permanently removing fishing vessels from the whitefish fleet, will help offset quota reductions.   The objective of the current decommissioning scheme is to deliver an efficient, effective and viable fishing fleet  capable of supporting a vibrant coastal community into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">This economic lift comes from the redistribution of the whitefish and prawn catch previously taken by the vessels being decommissioned which is currently estimated at some €22 million. This will, over the next 5 years result in up to €110 million in additional catching opportunities for those boats that remain.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">Decommissioning was primarily intended to benefit the owners and skippers who remain in the fleet rather than those who leave and I am confident that they will see the benefit of this policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2261">Changes in food prices are primarily a function of market forces operating at international, EU and national levels. Consistently strong economic growth in developing countries is a major driver of changing world food demand towards high-value agricultural products and processed foods.  Slow-growing supply, low stocks, and supply shocks at a time of increasing demand for feed, food and fuel have led to price increases globally. Biofuel production has also contributed to the changing world food equation. In common with the EU, Ireland is not impervious to this evolving change in context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2262">It should be noted that rising input costs, at both producer and processor levels, have fed through to put upward pressure on food prices. Pressure on input prices, in particular energy and raw material, including feed, costs, have combined with strong competition on world dairy and cereal markets in increasing producer prices over the recent past. In this respect, recent developments in terms of declining oil prices and increasing levels of global production, particularly for cereals, must be viewed positively.  In addition, the recent package of reforms of the CAP, which will deliver an additional 500 million litres of Irish milk quota in the coming five years and the maintenance of milk market supports, is also very positive in the Irish context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">Recent data indicates that food and non-alcoholic beverage prices actually decreased by 0.1% in the month but increased by 4.6% in the year to October 2008. This compares to an increase of 4.4% for the year to October 2007. This rate of increase in food prices has moderated somewhat in recent months having peaked at 9.3% in March 2008. These trends mirror the trajectory in food prices as evidenced globally and across Europe throughout 2007 and into 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">In October 2008 Ireland's rate of food price inflation was below both the Eurozone and EU averages as measured by the EU's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>

            <p eId="para_2270">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 114 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">The movement of susceptible animals within and from bluetongue restricted areas is subject to EU legislation which is kept under ongoing review and adapted from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">As Ireland is free of Bluetongue, it has availed of certain transitional provisions available under EU rules which limit movements of live susceptible animals out of bluetongue restricted zones to cattle and sheep that are less than 90 days old or that have natural or vaccinated immunity to relevant strains of bluetongue. In addition all such animals are tested for bluetongue after arrival here.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">Notwithstanding the current safeguard arrangements that are in place with regard to trade, the recent cases of BTV1 in England and the ongoing confirmation of BTV6 and BTV8 in several member states mean that there are a number of strains of the bluetongue virus circulating in the EU.  The existence of several strains of bluetongue increases the risks and raises serious concerns about the wisdom of importing any animals from affected regions at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">Consequently, I have consistently urged Irish farmers not to import animals from any bluetongue affected country or region so as not to jeopardise our disease free status with its consequences for our entire livestock sector. Any such imports will continue to be tested and if found to be BTV positive to a PCR test, they will be immediately slaughtered and there are no compensation arrangements in place in the case of such slaughter. Accordingly, importers should be aware of the possible financial risks that they are now exposed to in addition to the risk that imports pose to the national herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_2278">My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures which support the maintenance and growth of the productive capacity of the agri-food sector. The 2009 Estimates provide over €1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of €1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over €3.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme and the Farm Waste Management Scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement. While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008. It should also be taken into account, that, in addition to the payments under these Schemes, a further € 920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">The total amount of €220 million payable to farmers under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best well funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of €3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food. It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</p>

To date a total of 45 vessels have accepted offers with one further vessel having until the 19th December to make a decision.  €21m will be spent in 2008 with an estimated €16m to be spent in 2009.  A significant economic benefit currently estimated at some €22m will accrue to the remainder of the fleet from the redistribution of the prawn and whitefish catch previously taken by the decommissioned vessels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2292">Steering a New Course, the Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-13 (The Cawley Report) recommended a restructured fishing fleet, consistent with the sustainable exploitation of available resources and economic requirements of vessel owners and the shore-based industries dependent on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2293">The Cawley report prioritised in the first instance a decommissioning scheme targeting the larger vessels (18 metres and over) in the whitefish fleet to deliver a basis for both stock recovery and long term viability.

            <p eId="para_2294">The report also noted that a specific economic or social impact analysis should be carried out in relation to vessels under 18 metres to determine the eligibility, urgency scope and cost of carrying out a targeted decommissioning scheme for such vessels.

            <p eId="para_2295">It is important that any decommissioning of vessels under 18 metres is targeted to take account of the overall strategy to achieve a balance between available resources and the fishing fleet as well as the impact of the current scheme.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2297">The agricultural sector is already making a significant contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol allowed Ireland to increase emissions to a level 13% above 1990 levels by 2012.  In its latest analysis, published in September 2008, the Environment Protection Agency projects that emissions from the agriculture sector in that period will actually fall to 18.95 million tonnes or 4.3% below 1990 levels.  The EPA's most recent calculation of historic sectoral emissions shows that emissions from agricultural sources decreased by 3.8% in 2007 compared to the previous year, continuing an almost uninterrupted downward trend since 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The continued implementation of the Nitrates Regulations is having and will continue to have an impact, as it results in better use of nutrients with consequently less nitrogen applications and therefore less nitrous oxide emissions.  Measures under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme are expected to raise awareness amongst farmers of the need to address climate change and also to promote greater acceptance and uptake of technologies that contribute to greenhouse gas abatement, such as use of minimum tillage and the adoption of low emission trailing shoe technology for slurry spreading.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">In terms of reduced fertiliser use and consequent emissions, organic farming will also have a role to play and is supported through my Department's Organic Farming Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2300">In meeting emissions reduction targets set under the Kyoto protocol, carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere, by forestry planted since 1990, is very important to Ireland.  Forestry is also a valuable source of renewable energy, displacing emissions from fossil fuels.  My Department continues to promote planting under the Afforestation Grant Scheme.  I believe that offset of domestic forestry sequestration must be allowed as a means of achieving any greenhouse gas emissions targets set for the post Kyoto period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">Energy crops can play a role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  To encourage cultivation, my Department introduced a National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare in 2007 to supplement the EU Premium of €45 per hectare.  A new Bioenergy Scheme was also launched offering establishment grants worth €1,450 per hectare to plant willow and miscanthus.  Land planted with energy crops can also benefit under the Single Payment Scheme as well as REPS and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, subject to some restrictions on the areas planted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">My Department continues to examine various abatement options in close liaison with Teagasc.  There has been a significant commitment of €15.5 million to climate change research projects since 2005 under the Research Stimulus Fund operated by my Department.  This includes research into areas such as increasing efficiencies, improved slurry application, increased use of clover, which would reduce nitrogen usage, non-inversion tillage and increasing the length of grazing season.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">However, achieving the EU's post-Kyoto target of a 20% reduction on 2005 emissions levels by 2020 poses very significant challenges for Ireland, and in particular for the Irish agriculture sector.  If the target were to be applied pro rata to agriculture it could not be achieved without considerable downward pressure on animal numbers, particularly in the suckler herd.  At a time when world-wide demand for beef is growing, and alternative supplies come from regions where farming practices are much less sustainable in terms of climate change emissions and the environment generally, I do not believe that such an approach would be consistent with the fundamental objectives of the global climate change strategy.  I made my views known at the September meeting of the EU Agriculture Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_2310">The horticulture and nursery sector contributed approximately €282 million to farm output in 2007.  The sector has considerable potential for further development but is experiencing strong competitive pressures, particularly from the highly concentrated retail chain and from imports.  In March 2007 Bord Bia published the Strategic Review of the Horticulture Industry which identified the issues that need to be addressed if the sector is to maximise its potential.  These recommendations were taken into account in its 2008 programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2311">Producers concentrate for the most part on supplying the home market and on import substitution.  The only notable exception is the mushroom sector in that up to 80% of this crop is grown for export to the UK.  The EU prohibits supports which are targeted at import substitution but aid is available under the NDP scheme of investment aid for the commercial horticulture sector and the NDP scheme for capital investments in marketing and processing in the horticulture sector to assist in the upgrading or development of facilities with the aim of maximizing the potential of the sector.  The EU producer organisation scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, to concentrate marketing and improve quality.</p>

            <p eId="para_2313">The net financial ceiling under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme is €1.274 billion, net of 5% Modulation, while the budgetary figure for the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (DAS) is €257 million, which also includes provision for residue payments from previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">Although a total of 133,046 applications were received under the 2008 Schemes, these represent a maximum payable of approximately 125,000 Single Payment applications, the balance of applications having been submitted in connection with participation in the DAS and REPS schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">While under the EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme, the earliest date payments may issue is 1 December of the scheme-year concerned, provision is also made for payments to be made earlier, subject to EU approval. Prompted by the very wet summer, which seriously affected farming, I approached the Agriculture Commissioner seeking agreement to an early advance 50% payment, in line with arrangements agreed for the 2007 scheme. The necessary approval was readily forthcoming and advance payments began issuing on 16 October, the first day of the new EU financial year, with balancing payments beginning to issue on 1 December. To date, payments of €1.2 billion have issued to some 121,000 applicants. Deductions in respect of Modulation, at a rate of 5%, have been taken from those payments already made; the refunds due in respect of the deductions made on the first €5,000 of each individual's total Single Payment will be made early in the New Year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">Under the 2008 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, 104,783 applications were submitted, of which approximately 102,500 are eligible under the scheme requirements. Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme commenced on 24 September and, to date, payments worth €247 million have issued to 98,938 applicants. The Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is co-funded by the National Exchequer and the EU; as the earliest date for payments under the scheme is not defined in EU Regulations, my Department aims to make these payments at the earliest possible date, subject to all necessary verifications being completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">In respect of both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, payments initially issue in respect of those cases confirmed clear for payment at that stage and then continue to issue as further cases subsequently become clear. Where applicants under either scheme have not been paid it is due to issues highlighted at validation, which require to be resolved by the given applicant, on foot of correspondence issued by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2321">In February this year acting on a central recommendation from the Cawley report and following State Aid approval by the European Commission, a scheme to permanently withdraw capacity from the whitefish sector of the Irish fishing fleet was launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">To date 57 vessels have been approved and offered decommissioning grants. 45 vessels have accepted with a total of 21 million Euros being spent in 2008 and in excess of €16 million committed for decommissioning payments in 2009.   This amount of €16m is provided to BIM in the 2009 Estimates and accordingly there is no remaining balance of funds available for reallocation for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">Under the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013 €46 million is the maximum amount that can be paid out by the State on decommissioning; this allows for 75% of the €46 million to be paid by the EU.  As already stated €37 million of this has been committed under the current scheme and 75% of this amount will be recouped.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">This decommissioning scheme announced in February is now closed and final payments under the scheme will be made in 2009.</p>

The Irish submission was the subject of a lengthy bilateral meeting at official level with the Commission on 30 September.  At that meeting it was made clear that the submission cannot be implemented unless the Commission secures and allocates the necessary funding to Ireland. I also pressed the matter at the September Council and looked for early proposals from the Commission. The stated position of the Commission is for Member States to re-engineer their Fisheries Operational Programmes to give priorities to the new measures catered for in the emergency package. This is not an option for Ireland as we have already committed €32m of our total EFF allocation to the current decommissioning scheme which does not allow for any further flexibility with the remaining measures proposed. We will continue to push Ireland's case over the coming period with a view to the Commission bringing forward firm proposals to provide additional funds that will enable the full implementation of our proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_2331">My Department, through its Veterinary Inspectorate, is responsible for the supervision of 165 large meat processing plants, including 10 poultry processing plants, which are approved under the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">The Department employs Veterinary Inspectors and technical staff, and engages Temporary Veterinary Inspectors on a contract for service basis to carry out meat inspection duties, with the aim of ensuring that the highest standards of food safety are achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2334">These figures include 10 Veterinary Inspectors, 16 technical staff and 40 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors based in poultry plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">In a number of cases, the duties of these inspection staff include official supervision both at plants that process poultry and at plants that process different species of meat.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">The cost of the inspection service including salaries, overtime, allowances, fees and PRSI in 2007 in meat plants generally was €38.0m. An amount of €16.6m was recovered in fees from industry, leaving a net cost as calculated on this basis of €21.4m.  The corresponding cost in poultry plants in 2007 is calculated at €4.0m, less €1.1m recovered from industry, leaving a net cost of €2.9m.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2340">My approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to focus available resources on the measures which support the maintenance and growth of the productive capacity of the agri-food sector. The 2009 Estimates provide over €1.8 billion for my Department, and, when combined with EU funding of €1.4 billion, means that total expenditure in 2009 by my Department will amount to over €3.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">While difficult decisions had to be taken in light of the situation of the public finances, account also had to be taken of the very high level of investment by the Government in recent years, when significant additional financial resources were committed to areas such as the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, where the rates of grant had been increased by 17 per cent, the new Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme and the Farm Waste Management Scheme and, indeed, the 8% increase in rates under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme itself, introduced in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">With regard to the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I decided to reduce expenditure for 2009, by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares (84 acres) and by a small increase in the minimum stocking density requirement. While overall expenditure will fall, almost 67,000 farmers will not suffer any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. Furthermore, these farmers, as well as all claimants under the Scheme, will continue to benefit from the substantial increase of 8% in the rate of aid introduced by the Government in 2007.  In addition, of the 102,500 farmers who benefit under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, in excess of 50,000 of these also benefit under REPS, while in excess of 47,000 also benefit under the Suckler Welfare Scheme, which introduces a new stream of payments to farmers in 2008. It should also be taken into account, that, in addition to the payments under these Schemes, a further €920 million was paid to farmers with Disadvantaged Area lands under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">The total amount of €220 million payable to farmers under the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is part of the overall substantial injection of funds paid to farmers situated in the areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances and the decisions I have taken against that background, the position is that in excess of €3.2 billion will be spent next year by my Department in support of agriculture, fisheries and food. It is important to get through this challenging period and continue towards achieving the full potential of our most important indigenous industry when the economy begins to grow again.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">With regard to the increase in Modulation, agreed as part of the CAP Health Check, the suggestion that farmers will lose money as a result of this decision is totally misleading. In fact, farmers will receive increased payments of over €70 million over the next four years, which will come from the access to unused funds in our SPS ceilings, also agreed as part of the CAP Health Check. This is additional money that will go directly into farmers' pockets through new measures, as under current rules it cannot be accessed, because of the complex requirements governing the SPS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">In addition, the agreed rates of additional modulation will generate in the region of €120m in total over four years in transfers from the Single Payment Scheme to Rural Development. This money will remain in Ireland and will be used for payments to farmers under the Rural Development Programme. Again we will need to decide how these funds can be passed back to Irish farmers within the limitations set down in the new Regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">Based on the very significant level of participation, the cost of the scheme, at a rate of €80 per cow, will be some €77 million for 2008, of which €33 million has been allocated in my Department's Estimate for 2008. A further €44 million is provided in the 2009 Estimates to pay for the remaining 2008 born calves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">To ensure that the scheme is continued within the €250 million budget, it will, on current levels of participation, be necessary to reduce the rate of payment in future years.

The 2009 grant rate will be advised to participating farmers before the end of 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2353">Following historically high dairy product prices last year and into the early part of 2008, dairy exporters are now facing difficulties as markets have contracted and prices have returned to 2006 levels, with butter prices currently below intervention level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">In view of the current volatility in dairy markets, I contacted EU Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel in early November to activate market measures in support of the sector. I was pleased that the Commission acted decisively and brought forward the scheme of private storage aid for butter.  This will now take effect from 1st January, two months earlier than usual and will assist in stabilising the market.  At the Agriculture Council last Friday the Commissioner agreed to keep the market situation under review and to come forward with additional measures in the New Year should the situation warrant it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">Market supports are extremely important measures and I was determined to hold onto these in the Health Check.  Securing the retention of intervention for butter and SMP, without losing the compulsory purchase at the intervention price of the first 30,000 tonnes and 109,000 tonnes respectively was a major achievement, against very stiff opposition.  Even more important was the retention of private storage aid for butter in its current form.  This was crucial given our need to even out the production cycle and allow product to be kept under the control of the processors after peak production has closed.  The proposal to change the key characteristic of this scheme from obligatory to optional was something I was not prepared to accept.  I was particularly pleased that the Presidency accepted my view and in essence, we have secured the preservation of all the important market instruments that Ireland uses without any change whatever.</p>

            <p eId="para_2359">As the Deputy will be aware, no WTO agreement was reached at the July Ministerial meeting, despite exhaustive discussions over nine days. As of today, the Director General, Mr Lamy has not announced a new Ministerial meeting although there is speculation that one will take place before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">However, even if a ministerial meeting is called, it is not certain that there will be a successful outcome, given the economic and political situation worldwide. Despite ongoing discussions there is no agreement at present on the key issue of the Special Safeguard Mechanism which caused disagreement in July and ultimately led to the failure of the Ministerial meeting. Many other issues also remained outstanding at that time. Procedures in the WTO require the agreement of each of the 153 members to all aspects of the Single Undertaking which includes Agriculture, Non Agriculture Market Access, Services, Rules and Development Issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">It is no secret that I am not happy with some of the proposals currently on the table.  My concerns are borne out by the report produced in September last by FAPRI-Ireland/Teagasc.  This report assesses the likely impact of a WTO deal by comparing what would happen if there was a deal with what would happen without it in the period up to 2017.  They found that in relation to the dairy and cereals sector, WTO reform would be unlikely to have a major impact as EU prices for most dairy and cereal commodities are now quite close to international price levels.   However, the report found that the beef and sheep-meat sectors would experience substantial losses from tariff reductions.  In the case of beef, it found that even in the absence of a WTO agreement, EU beef imports are likely to grow strongly over the next 10 years.  It also found an important difference in the likely impact of a WTO deal if beef is declared a sensitive product by the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">In that respect, the views of the Irish Government in regard to the WTO negotiations remain unchanged.  We want an agreement but that agreement must be balanced, that is to say, balanced in terms of the various strands of the negotiations and balanced within what Ireland and the EU are prepared to concede and the concessions offered by trading partners.  Ireland remains determined that agriculture should not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement. The EU negotiating mandate is that the terms of any new WTO agreement should not necessitate a further reform of the CAP. We carried out our reforms in 2003, in preparation for the WTO negotiations. I and my colleagues in Government will continue to make all efforts to secure a deal that delivers real benefits to Ireland, the EU and developing countries and does not sacrifice the agriculture sector.   We will assess the balance and ambition if and when a full package, including services, rules and trade facilitation is ultimately agreed.</p>

         the timeframe for payments to 11,000 farmers under REP scheme four; if payment will be made to those farmers before Christmas 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2390">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released fairly soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1C's) returned before 5 December, 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely. I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

        <b>Deputy Ulick Burke</b>
         asked the

         when he was informed of the proposal to ban whitefish fishing in area 6A by the EU Commission; if he has conveyed his opposition or other views to the Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_848">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2394">This matter refers to a recent proposal by the European Commission which calls for the establishment of a moratorium on fishing certain whitefish species in the area off the northwest coast — technically called Area VIa which covers the areas from the south Donegal coast north to north of Scotland.  It applies to all waters of a depth less than 200m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">The proposed ban prohibits any fishing activity within this specified area.  Certain and very limited derogations are allowed.  According to the Commission, their justification for this measure is based on scientific advice which has determined that the stocks of haddock, cod and whiting in the area are in poor shape and need time to recover.  The stated purpose of this proposal is to provide "breathing space" for these whitefish species to recover.</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">Derogations for fishing in the area are to be allowed for fishing of pelagic species, shellfish with pots, and nephrops with 80mm mesh using a Swedish grid and where at least 90% of the catches on board are nephrops.  Fishing for saithe and anglerfish will also be allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">Prior to the proposal being published, the Commission had not given any advance warning or notification of its intentions.  The proposal has been included in Annex III of the Commission's 2009 TAC and Quota proposal, which was published on the 10th November.  The TAC and Quota Regulation sets out the various fishing opportunities for Member States for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">I have consulted with the Industry on this proposal and I share its concerns about its content as well as the irregular procedure — especially the lack of consultation — employed by the Commission to bring it forward.  It is clear to me that the proposal as it stands would have significant adverse socio-economic impacts on the fishing communities off the northwest coast.  It could also cause a significant displacement of fishing effort to other fishing areas, as vessels capable of moving to other areas shift the focus of their operations.  This would have major implications for stocks outside of area VIa where increased fishing activity would take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">I have already raised my concerns with the Commission and am asking for a proper evaluation of the measures by STECF and for full discussions with stakeholders through the Regional Advisory Council.  I am liaising closely with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on this issue and will be working hard in advance of, and during, the December Fisheries Council to ensure that any measures agreed at the Council are proportionate, appropriate and take into account the situation of the Irish whitefish fleet in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2401">The allocation of €128 million to the Forestry subhead for 2009 is evidence of the Government's commitment to maintaining an active and substantial forestry programme.  Provision has been made for the continuation of the Afforestation Scheme and some Forestry Support Schemes in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">However, much of the allocation is already committed, primarily to pay premiums to farmers who planted within the past 20 years. Prioritising certain schemes in light of the funding available will therefore be required in order to maximise the benefits for the stakeholders within the forest industry including Coillte Teoranta. My officials recently met with the stakeholders at a meeting of the Forestry Liaison Group and fully briefed them on the financial position for 2009 and the need for the prioritisation of programme expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2458">One of the major challenges in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agri-food sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market, which is focused on quality and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.  A key element of this strategy was the Dairy Investment Fund launched in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">My Department provided funding of €114 million towards investment in dairy processing and a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance under the Fund, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million at full production.  The purpose of the Fund is to increase the efficiency of the main dairy outputs by supporting the upgrading of plant and buildings.  This will assist operators in capturing new business in global markets and in developing new valued added products.  I am pleased to note that several of those projects have already been completed and others are progressing to the implementation phase.  This investment will help improve the efficiency of the dairy processing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">The recent CAP Health Check agreement had a positive outcome for the Irish dairy sector in two significant areas.  The importance of keeping critical market instruments and using them effectively to respond to price volatility in the period of transition to quota abolition in 2015 was a key priority for me.  Despite stiff opposition intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder, including the buying-in quantities at the fixed price of 30,000 tonnes and 109,000 tonnes respectively were maintained intact.  Moreover, the private storage aid for butter was also left unchanged.  This is particularly important for Ireland given our seasonal pattern of production and is a major boost for the processing sector over the next seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">With regard to milk quotas, it was agreed that they would be increased by 1% per year for the next five years.  This is on top of the 2% increase already granted in the current quota year.  In addition, there will be an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism in 2009 and this is equivalent to a 2% increase in Ireland's quota.  Ireland is especially well placed to benefit from these changes due to our additional production potential.  Taking all these together, there will be a cumulative increase in Ireland's quota of 9.3% by 2014, or almost 500 million litres more than our quota in 2007.  That equates to around 130 million euro of additional income at farm gate level.  The net effect is that our producers and processors now have policy clarity and can plan their investments with a greater degree of certainty about the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2465">Regarding the specific issues mentioned, a 50% reduction in pesticide use does not necessarily result in a reduction in the risk arising from pesticide use.  Therefore, I support the Common position negotiated at Council, which refers to a reduction in risk from pesticide use.  The introduction of a single or multiple zones is not expected to impact negatively on the registration or availability of pesticide products in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2467">The main challenge facing the indigenous Irish poultry industry is competition from imports of fresh poultry from other EU countries.  Under single market rules unrestricted volumes can be traded between Member States and, for various reasons, they are very competitively priced.  The primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry is the fresh retail trade where Irish product is still dominant.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme is a recognised quality mark in that market and the Bord has been very active in growing and enhancing the scheme over the years.  In addition to the Quality Assurance Scheme, assistance is available from Enterprise Ireland for certain types of activities undertaken by poultry processors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">Labelling continues to be an issue for the sector.  I believe there should be country of origin labelling on all meats and my Department has been in extensive communication over the past year with the European Commission with a view to making such labelling compulsory.  While the Commission adopted a negative opinion in relation to our proposal for national legislation, I will continue to press for country of origin labelling in the context of the Commission's proposal for a new regulation on food information.

            <p eId="para_2477">In practical terms, the Reform Treaty will not alter the arrangements that currently apply in the fisheries sector to any great extent, other than applying the principle of co-decision in certain areas for the first time.  Fisheries are now included in the Articles on the Common Agricultural Policy and references to the Common Agricultural Policy will be deemed to include fisheries.  The Reform Treaty introduces the principle of qualified majority voting to certain new areas but the principle of qualified majority voting is already enshrined in the fisheries sector for some considerable time.  While there will be some alterations to the thresholds for reaching a qualified majority under the new arrangements, these alterations will not have significant implications for decision-making.  The reality is that most decisions on fisheries are arrived at by consensus.</p>
            <p eId="para_2478">The Treaty will provide a greater degree of democracy in the decision-making process.  The European Parliament will have a greater say in future EU legislation on fisheries, with the exception of a small number of dossiers related to fixing of Total Allowable Catches and quotas.  Our own Oireachtas also will have an enhanced role under the Lisbon Treaty along with the national Parliaments of the other Member States and these changes apply equally to the fisheries sector.  National parliaments will have a longer period of time to scrutinise proposals.  They will also have the power to object to a draft proposal on the grounds that it breaches the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2479">However, in relation to fisheries, a significant exception will be the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, which will be dealt with by the Council of Ministers on a proposal from the European Commission, as is the current process.  Total Allowable Catches and Quotas for the majority of commercial fish stocks in European waters are proposed by the Commission each year for the following year, taking account of scientific evidence on the state of each stock, the respective management measures in place, and the catches taken during the year.  These proposals are the subject of extensive negotiations at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council each December.</p>

            <p eId="para_2483">I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 129 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2484">When Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, the Community received a very significant additional fishing resource out to the 200 mile limit.  At that time however, Ireland's fishing industry was totally underdeveloped.  In this context, the 1976 Hague Agreement recognised the development needs of peripheral regions whose populations were heavily dependent on fishing activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2485">The Hague Agreement allowed Ireland to double its 1975 catches of a number of stocks.  These target catches are called the Hague Targets.  The UK was also granted a number of Hague Targets.  The actual quotas are set for relevant stocks at the average of what the quota would have been without the Hague and the relative proportion of the Hague target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2486">The Hague Preferences have been a fundamental part of relative stability and have been recognised as such in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) framework since 1983.  Most recently the Hague Preferences are recognised in Council Regulation 2371/2002 following the review of the CFP in 2001/2002.  Further, the European Court (in 1998) upheld the appropriateness of the Council giving effect to the principle of relative stability through the application of the allocation keys together with the operation of the Hague Preference to take account of the special needs of Ireland and the northern part of the United Kingdom.  At the Fisheries Council, each December, Ireland has consistently, and successfully, argued that Relative Stability has therefore to be applied taking due account of the prior Hague Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2487">There is, however, strong opposition to the application of the Hague Preferences from certain Member States and the European Court judgment of 1998 does give discretion on their application to the Council.  It is important to be aware that with reduced Total Allowable Catches in recent years, the impact of the application of the Hague Preferences is increasing both for Ireland which gets increased quotas and for other Member States whose quotas reduce.  We are likely to face significant opposition to their application at Council this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">I remain of the view that the invocation of the Hague Preference continues to constitute an essential part of the system of relative stability as applied under the CFP, and will look to the Commission and Council to continue to respect invocations of the Hague Preference at this December Fisheries Council.  Going forward, I am also committed to the continuation and strengthening of the Hague Preferences in the CFP legal framework in the planned review which must be completed by 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2514">Under the final compromise in the Health Check negotiations, a 5% increase was agreed in the rate of modulation.  I would have preferred if no additional modulation were agreed.  However, this was one element of the Health Check proposals on which Commissioner Fischer Boel was particularly determined.  Nevertheless, I succeeded in co-operation with my colleagues from other Member States, in getting the rate of additional modulation considerably reduced and ensured that all the funds raised can be passed straight back to Irish farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">The agreed rates of additional modulation will generate €120 million in total over the four years from 2009-2012 in transfers from the Single Farm Payment to rural development.  As I have said these additional funds will stay in Ireland and be passed back to Irish farmers under the Rural Development Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">In line with the new Regulations they must be used for measures to address the so-called new challenges of climate change, water management, bio-energy and biodiversity, dairy restructuring and innovation.  I will be consulting widely with stakeholders as to how these funds can best be used for the development of Irish agriculture.</p>

            <p eId="para_2518">The very poor state of many whitefish stocks targeted by the Irish fishing fleet is clearly reflected in the decreases in annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and quota allocations that Ireland receives and in the landings of the fishing fleet over the past decade.  The levels of TAC and ultimately quotas for Ireland are determined each year at the December Fisheries Council following negotiations with Member States and the EU Commission.  This process for 2009 has already begun in earnest with the publication of the Commission's proposals which will be the subject of detailed and protracted discussions over the coming weeks.  This Commission proposal sets out cuts in many of the stocks of economic importance to our fleet and also envisages other measures which will adversely impact on our fishing industry, including a proposed closure for the whitefish fleet off the north west.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">However, not all stocks are subject to decreases in TACs with the mackerel TAC going up by 33% from 456,000 tonnes in 2008 to 605,000 tonnes in 2009.  This will result in the net Irish quota (after deductions for the payback for undeclared Scottish landings) going from approx 45,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes.  However, this TAC increase remains to be formally agreed and must be protected against any proposal that a part would be transferred to Norway in the EU/ Norway negotiations which are currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">This hugely significant increase is the reward for Irish fishermen adopting tough responsible fishing practices for this stock.  In value terms using an estimated price per tonne of €1,200, this results in an increase of over €20m to the Pelagic fishing sector in 2009 (from €54m to €74.4m).</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">Notwithstanding the good news on mackerel, I am concerned with the level of cuts proposed for the whitefish stocks, the proposed closure in the north west and other measures proposed and their socio economic impact on fishermen and fishing communities.  I can assure the Deputy that I am actively engaged, as are my officials, in delivering the best possible deal for Ireland and there will be a lot of long days and late nights in the upcoming negotiations before a settlement is reached on the final package of measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2523">I have received a number of representations, directly and indirectly, from various interest groups outlining their views on the impact of the 2009 budget for my Department and requesting that I reconsider my decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2524">The situation is that the 2009 budget was framed against the background of a serious deterioration in the public finances which required difficult decisions to be made on the allocation of the limited resources available.  I made these decisions in the best interests of the agriculture, food, fisheries and forestry sector following detailed analysis of my Department's programme of expenditure and careful consideration of all of the options available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2525">Despite the economic and budgetary situation, funding of €1.8 billion gross is provided for my Department in the 2009 Budget.  When combined with EU funding of about €1.4 billion next year, this represents a very substantial provision for the support and development of the agri-food sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">In framing the details of the budget for my Department, my priorities were to ensure that the available resources were targeted on a range of measures that would maintain the productive capacity of the agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries sector, to continue the development of the sector within the budgetary constraints and to ensure that it is well positioned to achieving its full potential and benefit from future economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">The Rural Development Programme, 2007-2013, which provides for total expenditure by my Department of about €5.4 billion, EU and Exchequer, is only one element of an overall approach to the development of the sector.  The Rural Development Programme covers a range of measures including the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, Compensatory Allowances in Disadvantaged Areas, the Early Retirement Scheme, On-Farm Investment, and Agricultural Training.  These complement a range of nationally funded schemes such as the Welfare and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Cows and the Forestry Afforestation and Support Schemes.  In addition, payments of about €1.3 billion are made under the Single Payment Scheme each year.  Last week, in the Council of Ministers, I negotiated changes in the ‘Health Check' to the Common Agricultural Policy which will yield further benefits to Irish agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">Despite the level of on-going support, there is no room for complacency. I will keep all aspects of my Department's expenditure under close scrutiny during 2009 to ensure that my objectives are achieved and, in the normal course, I will also review spending priorities in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Estimate for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2532">The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem and is on the agenda of all major international organisations who deal with the development of sustainable sea fisheries and the protection of marine ecosystems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">Discarding is usually a feature of mixed fisheries where one species may be the target of fishing activity, but other species may be caught accidentally in the fishing gear.  It can also occur for economic reasons, i.e., when smaller, less valuable fish are dumped in favour of larger, more marketable ones (a practice known as high-grading).</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">The discarding issue is already being addressed at a European level through measures regulating fishing gear, such as adjusting net mesh sizes or requiring acoustic devices to be attached to fishing gear.  A new discard policy, which aims to stop the practice of discarding, is under preparation and a consultation process is currently under way with all the stakeholders.  An effective resolution of the discards issue will likely require a combination of new policy and technical measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">At my meeting with Commissioner Borg on 18 June, I raised this issue as a priority for me and for the Irish fishing industry.  While he advised that finding effective solutions is challenging, he restated his commitment to continue prioritising the current work programme, which was agreed by the Council in June 2007.  I have sought to bring forward initiatives in this regard for the important nephrops fisheries and will continue to pursue these at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">I will continue to press for progress on this issue at national, EU and international levels and I am confident that, with the co-operation, collaboration and commitment of all the stakeholders, significant improvements can be achieved in this most sensitive area for the long-term sustainability of our industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_2543">In the light of the temporary volatility being experienced in international dairy markets at present and uncertainty in the short-term outlook, I contacted EU Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel seeking the introduction of market support mechanisms to assist the sector through the current difficulties.  I was pleased that the Commissioner acted decisively and brought forward the scheme of private storage aid for butter.  This will now take effect from 1 January, two months earlier than usual, and should go some way towards stabilising the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">Once the effect of the early introduction of APS is evident, we can then assess the need to activate other mechanisms to assist dairy exporters who are facing difficulties exporting product from the EU on to world markets.  I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy markets and will intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.  As part of the Health Check negotiations, as well as achieving a substantial increase of 9.3% in Ireland's milk quota, an essential step in dealing with the end of the quota system, I also succeeded in having market supports in the form of Intervention and APS retained as they currently apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">While we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  Global growth in wealth and population will provide opportunities for quality producers like Ireland.  One of the major challenges in the medium term will be to ensure that Irish farming and the agri-food sector is at the heart of an evolving high-value food market, which is focused on quality and innovation.  This is at the core of Government strategy, evidenced by the National Development Plan 2007-2013, AgriVision 2015 and the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_2547">The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation.  In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling progress has been made in relation to specific products: EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department collaborated with the Department of Health and Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling.  The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation.  At the relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13 October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland's proposed regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">The EU has 36 specific marketing standards covering fresh fruit and vegetables.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The EU Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables.  As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will be replaced by a general standard, which will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</p>

            <p eId="para_2553">I assume the Deputy is referring to the EU Commission  proposal that was made this year to include the Celtic Sea cod stock within the terms of the Community's Cod Recovery Plan.  The original plan was introduced in 2004 for four cod stocks: in the North Sea and Skaggerak, in the area West of Scotland, in the Kattegat and in the Irish Sea.  The plan, which set out catch ceilings and an array of technical management measures, was a response to scientific advice that these stocks were in decline and in danger of collapse.</p>
            <p eId="para_2554">Scientific assessments have shown that, after four years of application, only one stock (cod in the North Sea) demonstrated signs of recovery.  The slow progress made towards achieving the Cod Recovery Plan's goals prompted a re-examination and revision of the original plan this year.  As part of this revision, the Commission proposed that the Celtic Sea cod stock be included under the umbrella of the plan.  The Commission's scientific advice indicated that the Celtic Sea cod stock was also in need of rebuilding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2555">However, I and my colleague, Minister of State Killeen, strongly argued at Council that the terms of the Cod Recovery Plan were not suited to the Celtic Sea fishery.  Instead, we maintained that rebuilding measures based on the use of "smart" fishing gear (which reduces cod catches sea) and targeted area closures (some of which had already been proposed by fishermen and implemented to protect spawning cod) would be much more effective and better suited to the Celtic Sea fisheries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2556">Our consistent and firmly held belief was that the approach put forward by the Commission was not suited to the Celtic Sea and that it would not effectively rebuild that cod stock.  This point of view was finally accepted, and I am very pleased that Council supported and took on board this approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_2557">However, Ireland is committed to playing its full part in managing this stock responsibly.  Irish scientists, industry and managers will continue to work together to carefully examine proposals for management measures and ensure that any measures implemented are both necessary and effective.  Our common goal is to have a sustainable fishing industry with sustainable fish stocks operating in waters around the coast.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2559">I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposals from the EU Commission on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Health Check and the recent final negotiations, which I successfully concluded with my EU Council of Ministers colleagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">The package of measures that I secured for Ireland is of substantial value in terms both of additional funding worth some €70 million and additional milk quota valued conservatively at approximately €100 million by 2014.  It will have a lasting benefit not only on our farming community, but also on our agri-food sector as well as our rural and national economy.  These gains were hard won following all-night negotiations with 26 other Ministers, many of whom did not share my views on the future protection and development of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">I also lobbied hard and with considerable success for the retention of market supports in the dairy sector as well as simplification in the operation of EU schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">In advance of the negotiations, my Department engaged in a consultative process with key stakeholders to advise me on the main issues arising in the Health Check.  This consultative group examined the economic impact of the proposals from the Commission and also took into account the wider economic implications for the various sectors, the development of the rural economy and the agri-food sector.  I took full account of the feedback from this process during my negotiations with the Commission and in the Council of Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2563">The Deputy mentions the shift in world food production with increased product deficits and I was very conscious of this during the negotiations.  It was one of the reasons I argued for increases in milk quotas, in the light of the increase expected in world demand for dairy products.  Increased quotas and the retention of the market support mechanisms will be vital in giving confidence to our producers to expand production in a volatile market environment and in allowing them to meet the increased demand expected for dairy products in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2564">These Commission proposals were based on the European Council's decisions on the Financial Perspectives for 2007– 2013 and the invitation to the Commission to undertake a full, wide ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">As regards future EU agriculture policy after 2013, I had an opportunity to discuss this with my EU colleagues at a specially convened meeting of the Agriculture Council in Brussels on Friday last.  At that meeting, I strongly advocated that we maintain a strong agricultural production base in the European Union.  I referred specifically to the challenges ahead in meeting increased demands for food.  Indeed, I warned that any reduction in food production in the EU would be taken up elsewhere where less efficient production systems exist and would result in a heavier carbon footprint.  I emphasised that there would be a continuing need for an active, and appropriately resourced European agricultural policy to achieve these objectives and to help our farmers and processors adapt to the new and emerging challenges.</p>

            <p eId="para_2567">A strategic blueprint to develop the fisheries sector into the 21st century is contained in the report of the Seafood Strategy Review Group "Steering a New Course" (The Cawley Report).</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">One of the key recommendations of the Cawley Report was for the introduction of a sea fishing boat decommissioning scheme.  To date a total of 45 vessels have accepted offers with one further vessel having until 19 December to make a final decision.  €21m will be spent in 2008 with an estimated further €16m to be spent in 2009.  A significant economic benefit currently estimated at some €22m will accrue to the remainder of the fleet from the redistribution of the prawn and whitefish catch previously taken by the decommissioned vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">My Department will provide substantial grant aid support of €118 million for the seafood industry for 2009 and this will provide for significant investment for the Seafood Processing sector, Aquaculture Development, Socio-economic programmes for coastal communities, environmental initiatives, supporting quality initiatives/safety schemes and training.  Other areas to be supported include marketing and innovation.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara the main development agency has been allocated €44.5 million to support its activities in 2009 and will remain the main driver for the implementation of the Cawley report recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">My Department will also provide considerable funding for marine research.  The Marine Institute has been allocated €29.5m in 2009 to support its activities.  The Marine Institute is charged with managing and implementing "Sea Change" which is a marine knowledge, research and innovation strategy for Ireland (2007– 2013).  Implementation of this strategy is well advanced.  Sea Change incorporates applied and basic research programmes aimed at increasing industry competitiveness, building new research capacity and addressing policy issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">I established the Irish Sea Fisheries Research Partnership (ISFRP) (chaired by Peter Heffernan, CEO of MI), by which Marine Institute and industry will discuss and collaborate on the range of fisheries science research activities carried out by Marine Institute.  The Irish Sea Fisheries Research Partnership promotes synergy and mutual understanding on fishing science research priorities which are beneficial to the long term future of the Irish fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">Looking to the medium to long term, the review of the Common Fisheries Policy will be a high priority for all engaged in the fishing sector.  The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to 10 yearly reviews, the most recent in 2002 and the next formally provided for in 2012.  It has been acknowledged across EU Member States that further reform of the CFP is necessary.  Discussions have begun with the European Commission and we will continue to be active in our attempts to shape the direction of this review.  We wish to provide for and promote the interests of our seafood sector, which are very important to the protection of the livelihoods of our coastal communities.</p>

That amount may be used to target specific sectors in need of assistance and represents money that would otherwise not be available to farmers due to the complex rules surrounding the Single Farm Payment.  Support may commence in 2009 by utilising funds from the National Reserve, which are expected to be in the region of €6 million to €7 million, and these will be supplemented from 2010 with the unspent Single Farm Payment funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_2582">Political agreement was achieved on the Health Check on Thursday 20 November last following long and sometimes difficult negotiations.  The overall agreement represents a very good deal for Irish farmers negotiated in very challenging circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2583">Resulting from this agreement we now have funding to the tune of approximately €24m per annum which will be available to Irish farmers.  €17m from the unused Single Farm Payment funds will come on stream in 2010.  The additional €7 million will come from the National Reserve and will be available from 2009 as a result of a deal I managed to negotiate for Ireland.  These figures are estimates based on the level of payments under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme.  Final figures will not be known until the Commission detailed rules are adopted.  I am very pleased to get access to these untapped funds which heretofore could not be utilised fully due to the complexity of rules in the single farm payment system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">We need to consider carefully how these funds can best be used for the development of Irish farming in the context of the options available under the new Regulation.  While no decisions have been taken yet I am acutely aware of the difficulties in certain sectors and I will be consulting widely with all stakeholders on this issue in the coming weeks.  In this regard I have already said that I would welcome proposals from interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">In addition to the €24m mentioned, the agreed rates of additional modulation will generate in the region of €120m in total over four years in transfers from the Single Payment Scheme to Rural Development.  This money will remain in Ireland and will be used for payments to farmers under the Rural Development Programme.  Again we will need to decide in consultation with relevant stakeholders how these funds can be passed back to Irish farmers within the limitations set down in the new Regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2645">The next meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council is not scheduled to take place until 18/19 December next and no agenda has yet been received.  However, we are aware that the agenda will focus principally on fisheries and the setting of the annual Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas for fish stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">The levels of TAC and ultimately quotas for 2009 for Ireland will be determined at the Council.  This process for 2009 has already begun in earnest with the publication of the Commission's proposals which will be the subject of detailed discussions over the coming weeks.  This Commission proposal sets out cuts in many of the stocks of economic importance to our fleet and also envisages other measures which will adversely impact on our fishing industry, including a proposed closure for the whitefish fleet off the north-west.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">However, not all stocks are subject to decreases in TACs with the proposed mackerel TAC going up by 33% from 456,000 tonnes in 2008 to 605,000 tonnes in 2009.  This will result in the net Irish quota (after deductions for the payback for undeclared Scottish landings) going from approx 45,000 tonnes to 62,000 tonnes.  However, this TAC increase remains to be formally agreed and must be protected against any proposal that a part would be transferred to Norway in the EU/ Norway negotiations which are currently ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">Notwithstanding the good news on mackerel, I am concerned about the level of cuts proposed for the whitefish stocks, the proposed closure in the north-west and other measures proposed and their socio-economic impact on fishermen and fishing communities.  I am actively engaged, as are my officials, in delivering the best possible deal for Ireland at Council and there will be a lot of intense work in the upcoming negotiations before a settlement is reached on the final package of measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2679">I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed that a number of retailers may not be passing on to consumers the benefits of the Euro's recent appreciation in value, particularly against Sterling.  Arising from these concerns, I initiated an engagement with the retail sector as to the reasons why the benefits of the Euro's appreciation were not being passed on to consumers.  In the course of that engagement I met with IBEC and leading members of Retail Ireland, and also wrote to major individual retailers, to express the Government's concern on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">I also discussed these concerns with the National Consumer Agency and requested them to undertake specific price surveys comparing prices in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  Indeed the concerns in this area were if anything heightened by the cross Border survey of grocery prices undertaken by the Agency which showed that the price of branded products charged by retailers in the Republic were up to 31% greater than the price they charged for such products in Northern Ireland.  In the case of own brand products the price differential was up to 17%.  Whilst the Agency's cross Border survey was focused on food and grocery prices given their significance in terms of the average household budget, I understand that it is the Agency's intention to look at the possibility of including other areas of consumer goods in future surveys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2681">In so far as the response of the retail sector is concerned, retailers have advised that while the retail price of goods imported from the UK had lagged exchange rate movements due to factors such as the forward purchase of goods and currency, there had already been reductions in the price of some goods and further reductions were in the pipeline.  Retailers also advised that one of the main reasons for the price differential was that the cost of doing business in Ireland was significantly higher than that in the UK.  To that end, in September of this year I requested Forfás to carry out an analysis of the relative cost of doing business in a number of locations in the Republic, Northern Ireland and the UK.  I intend to pursue this matter with the retail sector on receipt of Forfás' Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">In so far as price trends between Ireland and the UK are concerned, the latest Central Statistics Office's bulletin for October shows that consumer prices continue to fall with overall annual inflation at 4.0% down from 4.3% in September.  This compares with an annual rate of 4.2% for the UK all items retail prices index.  Indeed on the basis of the EU comparison measure of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual rate of inflation in Ireland of 2.7% as at October 2008 is significantly less than both the annual inflation rates of 3.2% for the Euro 15 area and also the rate of 3.7% for the EU as a whole.  The harmonised rate is also below the equivalent UK CPI index rate of 4.5%.  In the area of food, the October CSO returns show that food prices in Ireland continue to fall with annual food inflation at 4.6% as compared with an annual UK food inflation rate of 10.1% as per the UK's Office of National Statistics.  In the area of clothing and footwear, prices actually decreased in both Ireland and the UK in the year to October 2008 by as much as 6.8% in Ireland as compared with 6.7% in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2683">Notwithstanding these welcome reductions in prices, it is my strong view that where there are significant differentials in consumer prices as demonstrated by the findings of the National Consumer Agency's cross Border survey, retailers have a duty to their customers and to the economies in which they operate to explain why there are such differentials.  It is my intention to continue to engage with the retail sector on this matter.</p>

This change will assist in minimising such risks by reducing the amount of cash in circulation. This measure is Revenue neutral as it will be funded by the increase from 30c to 50c in the rate of duty on cheques and bills of exchange.The potential gain to the Exchequer from doubling the rate of Stamp Duty on ATM and debit cards is estimated at €24m.</p>

            <p eId="para_2704">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator K.P.M.G. and McCann Fitzgerald.</p>
            <p eId="para_2705">The HSE has advised my Department that to date over 35,000 applications for living and deceased patients have been received by the Health Repayment Scheme. Approximately 33,000 of the claims received by the Scheme Administrator have been processed, which includes almost 19,000 offers of repayment totalling more than €362 million and in excess of 14,900 payments have been made totalling over €317m.  Further offers continue to be issued every week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2706">The Scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to settle claims as quickly as possible.  However, there are a number of  factors which have affected the length of time it takes to process a claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2707">A very high number of deficiencies have appeared on claim forms which must each be rectified before they can be processed. It is estimated that approximately two thirds of all claim forms were submitted without some critical piece of information which meant that the claim could not be processed until the Scheme Administrator had written to the potential claimant and requested the information required.  In addition, in excess of 75% of all Form of Entitlement forms submitted were deficient. The HSE and the Scheme Administrator has taken a proactive role in addressing this issue — the clearing of these deficiencies demanded significant time and resources on the part of the HSE and the Scheme Administrator so that they could be cleared.</p>
            <p eId="para_2708">Over 13,400 estates who have lodged claims did not have a grant of representation, as required by law, and the Scheme Administrator has had to establish probate before the claim can be progressed. This is to ensure that the person entitled to claim on behalf of an estate is the person who ultimately receives the repayment.  The probate process can typically be a lengthy one — however a special system established for the purposes of this scheme has significantly reduced the waiting period. The majority of certificates of entitlement have now been issued and this has facilitated people in proceeding with the application proper. The requirements of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 rightly place a strong emphasis on detail and on ensuring that a person is entitled to make the application and would be the rightful recipient of any potential repayment. For example this would be particularly important in determining who would be eligible in the case of a deceased person where no grant of probate was made and where several family members might make an application for repayment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2709">The HSE has advised that it is anticipated that the remaining offers, upwards of 300, will be processed by the end of the year.  However, it should be noted that the repayments offered cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period for appeal has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator.  In addition, claimants who receive offers must be given the opportunity if they so wish, to appeal the Scheme Administrator's decision.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_2717">I refer to the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  A central objective of the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, is to ensure that care is affordable for all who need it and that no-one has to sell their home during their lifetime in order to pay for their care.  In order to meet this objective, the scheme provides that a person may defer contributions based on their family home, or other Irish land-based assets, for the duration of their lifetime.  This benefit is referred to as "Ancillary State support".  The provision of Ancillary State support is subject to a Charge being placed against the asset concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2718">If a person wishes to avail of Ancillary State support and is of diminished mental capacity, they will require a care representative to act on their behalf unless they are already a Ward of Court or already have a registered Enduring Power of Attorney in place.  A care representative is a person appointed by the Circuit Court to act on behalf of a person who is of diminished mental capacity.  The care representative can act on behalf of the person in relation to (i) an application for Ancillary State support, (ii) consenting to the creation of the charge against the asset concerned and (iii) matters relating to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme generally.  A care representative may not act on behalf of a person in relation to matters outside of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2719">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill sets out the basis for determining mental capacity and appointing a care representative.  It also stipulates the people who may act as a care representative as follows:the spouse or partner of the person, a parent of the person,a child of the person,a brother or sister of the person,a niece or nephew of the person,an aunt or uncle of the person,a registered medical practitioner or such other health practitioner (other than the proprietor of a nursing home in which the person resides or is likely to reside) as appears to the Court to be a fit and proper person to make the application. The list operates in descending priority although a person with a greater priority may consent to an application by a person of lower priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2720">Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the scheme also provides for one further deferral of contributions based on the family home where there is a spouse/ partner living in the family home or where there is a connected person who meets the criteria set out in the legislation.  This ensures that contributions may be further deferred for the lifetime of the spouse/ partner or the connected person.</p>

            <p eId="para_2738">The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish Citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour and not an entitlement. Applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved in the processing of applications have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are absolutely necessary to maintain the good reputation of our citizens and integrity of the naturalisation process. Consequently, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">Following the recent decentralisation of the Citizenship Section to Tipperary Town, substantial additional resources have been made available to the section in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants. This has had a positive impact on processing times with the average time to decision for applications for certificates of naturalisation now 23 months. It is expected that this will progressively improve over the coming year.</p>

The reasons include, failure to meet the entry criteria relating to age and residence, failure at interview/written stage, failure at the medical examination and failure at the security vetting stage.  As well as this, a significant number of applicants may not always be available to attend for interview or take up a place in training when it is first offered due to family, work or social commitments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2753">As I have stated on a number of occasions I am concerned with the situation we now find ourselves in following the growth in the licensing of hand guns over the past few years. We now have about 1,800 handguns licensed which was not as a result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  I would have concerns about the suitability of a large number of these firearms for legitimate target shooting purposes and I am not going to permit the growth of a 'hand gun' culture.  It was against this background that I recently announced my proposals for reform in this area, which include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns and a strict regime for renewal of existing licenses, with limited exceptions made in relation to Olympic sports.  My proposals, which were outlined in my statement of 19 November, will be reflected in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which I will be publishing in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">It is important to say that my proposals in relation to handguns will not impinge directly on the activities of the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  I recognise that those firearms holders pursue their legitimate interests in a law abiding way and am anxious to have a well regulated sector in which those interests can be successfully pursued, in cooperation with the relevant authorities.</p>

They were subsequently granted permission to remain for a limited period in each case. On the expiration of the temporary periods of residence, the persons concerned remained in the State without my permission. They then became illegally present in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">The persons concerned were then informed by letters dated 30 June 2008, and in one case 1 July 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them and afforded them three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of Deportation Orders or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">Their case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given in each case to representations submitted by the persons concerned for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 12 November 2008, I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of them. Notices of these Orders dated 19 November 2008 were served by registered post requiring the persons concerned to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on Tuesday 16 December 2008, in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">There is no appeals mechanism is respect of Deportation Orders. That said, it is possible to make an application for revocation of the Deportation Orders pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However any such applications would require substantial grounds in order to be successful. The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">I am satisfied that the applications made on behalf of the persons concerned for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, accordingly, the decision to deport them is justified.

Each of the programmes has rules and arrangements governing them and my Department has controls in place in relation to all of its programmes to secure the prudent management of its funds and the operation of its schemes.  The programmes are subject to independent audit. I am disappointed at the circumstances that this Project finds itself in. However, it is now a matter for An Garda Síochána to investigate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2783">Beneficiaries of my Department's programmes and schemes are subject to audit and inspection on a periodic basis and must offer assurances to my Department that funds are applied for the purposes granted, are accounted for on a proper basis and that evidence is available to verify that adequate systems of oversight are in place for the management and application of grants.  Where shortcomings in these arrangements are identified, beneficiary groups may have their funding reduced, withdrawn, or reclaimed. Similar arrangements apply where an intermediary organisation is engaged by my Department to deliver funding on its behalf. If the Deputy has any particular community programme or project in mind, I will be glad to provide more specific information if the relevant details are provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_3003">The cohesion process has been completed with the establishment of new integrated local development companies and the alignment of the governance arrangements of the 12 existing integrated LEADER/ Partnership companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3004">The newly established companies are in the process of appointing CEO's and securing the appropriate transfer of existing staff and resources from the old LEADER and Partnership companies.  The transfer of staff is being conducted in line with the provisions of Transfer of Undertakings legislation.  Pending the completion of the formal transfer process, temporary local arrangements are being put in place by agreement between the relevant companies to facilitate the operation of the new companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3005">As the Deputy will be aware, the completion of the cohesion process in respect of all of these companies, enabled me to announce on 4 November last allocations totalling €400m. under the new National Rural Development Programme.  I look forward to the early signing of contracts with the individual companies and the commencement of the roll-out of the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3047">As the Deputy is aware, there are a number of Departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  However, the level of State funding on drug-related issues can be difficult to estimate as the costs associated with services provided by An Garda Síochána, the Prison Service, the HSE and others deal with drug misuse as part of their wider daily services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3048">Bearing these limiting factors in mind, it is estimated that funding for the development, co-ordination and delivery of the pillars under the current National Drugs Strategy for 2007 amounted to approximately €232m. The breakdown of this estimated figure is set out in the table.  The funding available through my Department for the Drugs Strategy in 2008 is €64.332m.  Figures for the other Departments and Agencies for this year are not yet available.  Estimate of 2007 funding directly attributable to drugs programmes under the National Drugs Strategy</p>

            <p eId="para_3081">In assessing means deriving from payments received from EU Member States (including U.K.) which do not form part of the EMU currencies, the Department uses the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on Social Security for Migrant Workers. The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-EMU currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter. This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter. Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is more beneficial to the customer. When reviewing customers who are in receipt of British pensions the exchange rate used to convert Sterling is the rate applicable to the second quarter (i.e. the quarter in which the British pension increase occurred) or the third quarter if that is more beneficial.</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">The Department does not generally review claims specifically because of movements in the exchange rate. However, it is open to any pensioner who believes they may be entitled to an increase in the rate of their State Pension (Non Contributory) payment to seek to have their means reviewed. It should be noted that changes to the value of a British pension due to currency fluctuation may well be offset by annual increases to the rate of those pensions that have yet to be included in the assessment and consequently the customer's State Pension (Non Contributory) payment may be unchanged or even reduced as a result of a review. In this regard the Department is aware that the British Retirement Pension (including graduated pension rates) has been increased by 3.9% effective from the 7th April 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3204">The new Reserve Defence Forces established on 01 October 2005 has placed the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) on a firm platform to develop into an efficient modern Defence Asset.  Central to this reorganisation was the recommendation of the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Board Report that the historic promotion system within the old reserve be replaced with a system to reflect best Human Resources (HR) practice.  Paragraph 9.6 of the Report states, "A new promotion system, based on the PDF Model, will be devised, developed and implemented.  Performance appraisal and effective input into unit activities will be important factors in selection for promotion."</p>
            <p eId="para_3205">The new Permanent Defence Force (PDF) based promotion model was successfully introduced in 2005 for the selection of the first four RDF Lieutenant Colonels.  In 2007 and 2008 Captain to Commandant competitions were conducted based on the PDF promotion model.</p>
            <p eId="para_3206">It was hoped to conduct a Lieutenant to Captain competition in 2007 however, due to administrative difficulties including the collation of accurate up to date Annual Confidential Appraisal Reports in respect of eligible Reserve Officers, the competition did not take place until 2008.  The new promotion system for Reserve Officers, based on the Permanent Defence Force model, has been introduced consistent with the recommendations of the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Board Report.  This system reflects best HR practice and will ensure that the best officers are promoted across all officer ranks in the Reserve Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">The military authorities are examining the procedures in respect of the Lieutenant to Captain competition to ensure that any unnecessary delays, that have arisen, do not negatively impact officers in respect of any further competitions.  On completion of their deliberation and prior to any new competitions in 2009 the military authorities will consult with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.   I have been assured by the Military Authorities that the promotion process will function in a timely manner in future.</p>

The Guidelines use illustrative examples to identify those who might fall into this category including: people who have spent much of their lives in rural areas and are building their first homes; farmers and their families; returning emigrants; people involved in forestry, inland waterway and marine-related occupations; teachers in rural schools; and other people whose work is predominantly in rural areas.

            <p eId="para_3231">Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the original Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.  The National Waste Report 2006 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 57.3% in that year, indicating that Ireland continues to exceed the current target recovery rate of 50% set by the Packaging Directive.  This compares with a recovery rate of 14.8% in 1998.  Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive introduces a new increased packaging waste recovery target of 60% (with 55% by way of recycling) as well as material specific recycling targets for glass, paper/board, metals, plastics and wood. These targets, including the glass packaging recycling target of 60%, have to be achieved by Ireland by 2011. The recycling rate for glass packaging in 2006 was 62.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3233">I fully recognise that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance. The Programme for Government commits us to a comprehensive review of waste management planning, which I initiated in July 2008. This review will ensure that our waste management plans reflect best international practice and that we have the policies and infrastructure to meet ambitious environmental objectives.  The review is also looking at the desirability of other producer responsibility schemes, including deposit and refund for beverage containers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3238">The Local Government Act 1994 provided that the boundaries of certain town councils could be altered by regulation, solely for local electoral purposes, following agreement by the relevant local elected councils. This was done in order to extend the franchise to individuals living in built up areas that form part of the towns but are outside of the towns' administrative boundaries. Ballyshannon is among those town councils which were so extended. The relevant provisions of the 1994 Act were repealed by the Local Government Act, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_3239">It is open to any local authority to initiate an application for a boundary alteration to have effect for all statutory functions.

Stronger Local Democracy acknowledged that the 1994 town boundary changes have resulted in an anomalous situation in several towns, as residents of the environs of such towns may help elect a town council but do not fall within the council's functional area. The White Paper on local government, which I hope to finalise by the end of the year, will give further consideration to the general issue of town council boundaries.</p>

            <p eId="para_3244">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.

            <p eId="para_3245">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In this regard my Department has undertaken to implement a National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.  It will bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.  It will also facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">On the 25 November 2008 I announced that 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, has been selected as the preferred tenderer for the NBS following the conclusion of a comprehensive competitive procurement process.

Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1C's) returned before 5 December, 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3279">As Ireland is free of Bluetongue, it has availed of certain transitional provisions available under EU rules which limit movements of live susceptible animals out of bluetongue restricted zones to cattle and sheep that are less than 90 days old or that have natural or vaccinated immunity to relevant strains of bluetongue. In addition all such animals are tested for bluetongue after arrival here.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">Notwithstanding the current safeguard arrangements that are in place with regard to trade, the recent cases of BTV1 in England and the ongoing confirmation of BTV6 and BTV8 in several member states mean that there are a number of strains of the bluetongue virus circulating in the EU.  The existence of several strains of bluetongue increases the risks and raises serious concerns about the wisdom of importing any animals from affected regions at this time.  Consequently, I have consistently urged Irish farmers not to import animals from any bluetongue affected country or region so as not to jeopardise our disease free status with its consequences for our entire livestock sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">Any such imports will continue to be tested and if found to be BTV positive to a PCR test, they will be immediately slaughtered and there are no compensation arrangements in place in the case of such slaughter.

That amount may be used to target specific sectors in need of assistance and represents money that would otherwise not be available to farmers due to the complex rules surrounding the Single Farm Payment. Support may commence in 2009 by utilising funds from the National Reserve, which are expected to be in the region of €6 million to €7 million, and these will be supplemented from 2010 with the unspent Single Farm Payment funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_3288">It is essential, in my view, that we maintain a strong agricultural production base in the European Union in the years to come.  We must also undertake food production and distribution in a manner that is fully sustainable economically, socially and environmentally.  We face daunting challenges ahead in meeting increasing demands for food, in addressing climate change, in reconciling our need to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions with our desire to produce more food, in managing our natural resources and in meeting changes in consumer demands.  We must also be mindful of increased market instability and higher risks of animal and plant disease.  There will, therefore, be a continuing need for an active, and appropriately resourced, European agricultural policy to achieve these objectives and to help our farmers and processors adapt to the new and emerging challenges.  I believe that this must be the starting point for our future discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">We should in my view resist calls for the CAP to be scrapped or for any major shift in EU expenditure away from agriculture.  I had the opportunity to make these points to my Ministerial colleagues from other Member States at a specially convened meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on Friday last and I found a resonance in the views expressed by a majority of Member States.  At that meeting, I referred specifically to the challenges ahead in meeting increased demands for food.  Indeed, I warned that any reduction in food production in the EU would be taken up elsewhere where less efficient production systems exist and would result in a heavier carbon footprint and further diminish the prospect of enhanced global food security.</p>
            <p eId="para_3290">I also emphasised the crucial importance of the continuation of fixed decoupled payments, of allowing sufficient flexibility in our common policy to reconcile the differing needs of Member States and regions, of the effectiveness of rural development programmes in promoting structural change and producing public goods in farming and of the critical importance of equivalent standards for imports in the context of the demands from consumers for ever-higher standards of food production.</p>

            <p eId="para_3292">In general, responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">My Department is responsible for the operation of EU controls on imports of products of animal origin under the service contract with the FSAI and in compliance with Community rules for the hygiene of food and feed.  These rules stipulate that food products of animal origin imported from an EU source must be from approved food business establishments and be accompanied to destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the Member State of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">In the case of importation from third countries products of animal origin for human consumption must have originated in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment (with the exception of honey), be appropriately labelled and transported and must be accompanied by a veterinary health certificate in accordance with the models laid down by Community legislation.  My Department undertakes import controls in co-operation with Customs services.  Consignments from third countries must be landed at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU (FVO) for veterinary checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">The scope of products of animal origin coming under these requirements is set out under Commission Decision No. 2007/275/EC11 Official Journal of the European Communities No. L116 of 4.5.2007 which also provides for an exemption from border inspection in the case of certain composite and specified food products comprising processed low risk animal products and plant products that nevertheless must comply with public health requirements for placing on the market.  Consignments of animal products must remain under Customs control until the BIP has authorised entry into the EU.  Any imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_3296">Where non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.  Where there are risks to animal and public health, and in cases of animal disease outbreaks, the Community introduces safeguard measures banning or restricting imports until the risks have been removed.  The FVO monitors and inspects each Member State controls on Food Safety including the operation of BIPs to ensure the conditions for import and placing of animal products on to the market, as provided under the harmonized legislation, are being correctly applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3297">As the Deputy will be aware, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children my Department drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat.  Following notification of these proposals in accordance with EU requirements the Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  In the meantime the European Commission is undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation and in this context Ireland has sought the mandatory origin labelling for all meats.</p>
            <p eId="para_3298">Regarding fresh fruit and vegetables the EU has 36 specific marketing standards.  Apart from quality criteria these standards also set down strict provisions regarding labelling, including country of origin.  The Commission is currently reforming the Common Organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables.  As part of this process a number of the existing specific standards will, from 1 July 2009, be replaced by a general standard that will cover a wider range of fruit and vegetables.</p>

            <p eId="para_3304">I have received a number of representations, directly and indirectly, from various interest groups requesting that I reconsider the 2009 Budget decisions.  The situation is that the 2009 Budget was framed against the background of a serious deterioration in the public finances which required difficult decisions to be made on the allocation of the limited resources available.  I made these decisions in the best interests of the agriculture, food, fisheries and forestry sectors following detailed analysis of my Department's programme of expenditure and careful consideration of all of the options available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3305">However, despite the difficult economic and budgetary situation, funding of €1.8 billion gross is provided for my Department in the 2009 Budget.  When combined with EU funding and co-funding of about €1.4 billion next year, this represents very substantial funding for the support and development of the sector.  In framing the details of the 2009 Budget for my Department, my priorities were to ensure that the available resources were targeted on a range of measures that would maintain the productive capacity of the agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries sector, to continue its development within the budgetary constraints and to ensure that it is well positioned to achieving its full potential and benefit from future economic growth. With this in mind, I will keep all aspects of expenditure under close scrutiny during 2009.  In the normal course, I will also review spending priorities in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Estimate for my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3307">Agricultural production in Ireland and the EU must be viewed in the context of a reformed and evolving Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is placing much more emphasis on market orientation and competitiveness.  Following the decoupling of direct payments from production, farmers can now take advantage of the freedom to farm exclusively for the market, allowing them to focus on meeting the requirements of the consumer in a competitive manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">The primary indication of how competitive Ireland is, in this or any sphere, is how Ireland performs on increasingly competitive EU and world markets.  To survive and grow the sector must be highly competitive and innovative. In this regard the indications for Ireland are extremely positive.  Agri-food related exports in 2007 totalled over €9 billion, which represents an increase of over 6% on 2006.  The agri-food sector creates significant employment, employing approximately 160,000 persons directly.  These achievements are possible as Irish food exporters are able to compete on EU and global markets and possess a strong reputation for producing quality products backed by extensive EU approved quality assurance and safety systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_3313">A strategic blueprint to develop the fisheries sector into the 21ST century is contained in the report of the Seafood Strategy Review Group "Steering a New Course" (The Cawley Report).</p>
            <p eId="para_3314">One of the key recommendations of the Cawley Report was for the introduction of a sea fishing boat decommissioning scheme.  To date a total of 45 vessels have accepted offers with one further vessel having until the 19th December to make a final decision.  €21m will be spent in 2008 with an estimated further €16m to be spent in 2009.  A significant economic benefit currently estimated at some €22m will accrue to the remainder of the fleet from the redistribution of the prawn and whitefish catch previously taken by the decommissioned vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3315">My Department will provide substantial grant aid support of €118 million for the seafood industry for 2009 and this will provide for significant investment for the Seafood Processing sector, Aquaculture Development, Socio-economic programmes for coastal communities, environmental initiatives, supporting quality initiatives/safety schemes and training.  Other areas to be supported include marketing and innovation.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara the main development agency has been allocated €44.5 million to support its activities in 2009 and will remain the main driver for the implementation of the Cawley report recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">My Department will also provide considerable funding for marine research.  The Marine Institute has been allocated €29.5m in 2009 to support its activities.  The Marine Institute is charged with managing and implementing "Sea Change" which is a marine knowledge, research and innovation strategy for Ireland (2007-2013).  Implementation of this strategy is well advanced.  Sea Change incorporates applied and basic research programmes aimed at increasing industry competitiveness, building new research capacity and addressing policy issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">I established the Irish Sea Fisheries Research Partnership (ISFRP) (chaired by Peter Heffernan, CEO of MI), by which Marine Institute and industry will discuss and collaborate on the range of fisheries science research activities carried out by Marine Institute.  The Irish Sea Fisheries Research Partnership promotes synergy and mutual understanding on fishing science research priorities which are beneficial to the long term future of the Irish fishing industry</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">Looking to the medium to long term, the review of the Common Fisheries Policy will be a high priority for all engaged in the fishing sector.  The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to 10 yearly reviews, the most recent in 2002 and the next formally provided for in 2012.  It has been acknowledged across EU Member States that further reform of the CFP is necessary.  Discussions have begun with the European Commission and we will continue to be active in our attempts to shape the direction of this review.  We wish to provide for and promote the interests of our seafood sector, which are very important to the protection of the livelihoods of our coastal communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3320">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007–13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments.  The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_3321">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released fairly soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3322">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year.  Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1C's) returned before 5 December, 2008.  At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3332">The person named applied under Category C of the 2007 National Reserve which caters for farmers for whom at least 40% of their Single Payment was derived from direct payments associated with sheep production (Ewe Premium/Rural Word Premium) during the reference period, their existing Single Payment is less than €10,000 and individual payment entitlements are less than the District Electoral Division (DED) average value.  The maximum allocation under this category is €1,000.00.  The unit value of the entitlements of the person named (€326.06) is greater that the DED average value (€314.05) associated with her herd number and therefore she did not qualify under Category C of the 2007 National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">As category C of the 2007 National Reserve is a non-mandatory category, the EU Regulations provide that, in allocating entitlements to successful applicants, the Member State must ensure that the allocation does not have the effect of increasing the value of any existing entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">Similarly, the value of any new entitlements allocated to non-mandatory categories must not exceed the regional average.  The Member State was allowed to determine what constituted the regional average.  In Ireland's case the regional average value of entitlements is the average value of entitlements in the District Electoral Division (DED) associated with the applicant's herd number.</p>

            <p eId="para_3338">The school in question applied for funding in respect of summer works in 2008.  The particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible.  The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">The school also applied for emergency funding.  Emergency works grants are made available to schools most in need of resources as a result of unforeseen emergencies of a capital nature that may arise during the school year.  Following assessment of the application and in light of the large number of projects seeking funding from my Department for works of this nature from the budget allocated, unfortunately, it was not possible to provide funding from the emergency works grant scheme on this occasion for the works sought.</p>

Cothaíonn sé seo spiorad láidir pobail sa scoil féin agus i measc pobal na háite.  Sa bhliain a chuaigh thart, cuireadh i gcrích athnuachan tréimhsiúil bord bainistíochta na scoileanna.  Sampla é seo de shaoránacht gníomhach i measc pobal na n-áiteanna seo.  Saibhrítear rialachas na mbunscoileanna trí obair dheonach neamhleithleasach na mílte duine, bídís tuismitheoirí, múinteoirí, iontaobhaithe nó ionadaithe pobail.  Táim feasach chomh maith go dteastaíonn rochtain ar oiliúint agus ar thacaíocht chuí ó na Boird Bainistíochta féin má tá siad chun tacaíocht a thabhairt do scoileanna.  Tá maoiniú curtha ar fáil agam i 2008 d'oiliúint dá leithéid.  Tá ionchur saoránaigh á thabhairt ag gach aon bhall boird atá léirithe i gcónaí ag an mbunscoil i saol na hÉireann.  Ba cheart go mbeimis go léir an-bhródúil as an dtraidisiún seo agus mar Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta is mór agam an t-ionchur seo d'ár scoileanna agus go deimhin don sochaí ar fad.  Is é an deontas caipitíochta an príomhbhealach ina maoinítear scoileanna agus, in ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí buiséid atá ann faoi láthair, tháinig méadú de bheagnach 12% ar seo go dtí €200 in aghaidh an dalta ag an mbunleibhéal.  Mhéadaigh an deontas caipitíochta ag an iarbhunleibhéal go dtí €345.  Tá solúbthacht ag na scoileanna maidir leis an gcaoi ina n-úsáideann siad an maoiniú seo chun freastal ar a gcuid riachtanas ó lá go lá.  Ach más féidir, is ceadaithe dóibh an maoiniú a úsáid chun naisc lena bpobail áitiúla a fhorbairt.</p>

            <p eId="para_3372">Maidir le héileamh ar na coláistí samhraidh Gaeilge, níl aon amhras orm ná go spreagfaidh na socruithe nua do na scrúduithe stáit na mic léinn teacht ar dheiseanna a gcuid Gaeilge labhartha a chleachtadh.  Is ar bhainistíocht na gcoláistí samhraidh atá an phríomhfhreagracht maidir le caighdeán an tsoláthair iontu.  Comhlíonann cigireacht na Roinne a ról i leith dearbhú na cáilíochta trí mheastóireacht a dhéanamh ar cháilíocht an oideachais sna coláistí.  Déanann an chigireacht tuairisciú freisin ar chomh maith is a chomhlíonann na coláistí na riachtanais maidir le cóiríocht, cáilíocht mhúinteoirí agus eagrú agus feidhmiú na gcláracha.  Breathnófar in am trátha ar ról na cigireachta i meastóireacht na gcoláistí.  Leanfar leis an maoiniú a dhéantar ar fhreastal ábhar oidí ar na coláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht.  Leanfar freisin leis na socruithe maidir le saoire phearsanta bhreise a cheadú do mhúinteoirí bunscoile a mhúineann ar na coláistí samhraidh.  Toisc gurb iad áiteanna dúchais na teanga, tuigim an tábhacht chultúrtha agus sochtheangeolaíoch a bhaineann leis na limistéir Ghaeltachta, go háirithe d'fhoghlaimeoirí na teanga.  Tá áthas orm go leanfar le tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.</p>

Soiléiríodh na socruithe nua ag cruinniú le hionadaithe CONCOS in oifigí na Roinne Oideachais agus Eolaíochta i mBaile Átha Cliath, ar an gCéadaoin, 22 Deireadh Fómhair 2008.  D'fhreastail oifigigh na Roinne a bhfuil baint acu le cúrsaí riaracháin, agus dáileadh na ndeontas i leith na gcoláistí samhraidh, ar an gcruinniú seo.  Bhí ionadaithe ó chigireacht na Roinne i láthair chomh maith.  Rinneadh plé cuimsitheach ar na hábhair a bhain le deireadh a chur leis na deontais do na táillí teagaisc.  Pléadh ach go háirithe go gcuirfí deireadh le híocaíocht na dtáillí teagaisc do na mic léinn a fhreastalaíonn ar chúrsaí Aicme A, B agus C.  Tugadh míniú soiléir faoi chúiseanna na Roinne maidir leis an gcinneadh seo a dhéanamh.  Ní raibh aon ghá, mar sin, go mbeadh ionadaí ón Roinn i láthair ag an gcruinniú ar 8 Samhain, mar nach raibh cor nua sa scéal ón 22 Deireadh Fómhair.  Déanfaidh an Roinn teagmháil le CONCOS maidir leis na hábhair eile ar a lorgaíodh soiléiriú nuair a bheidh eolas ar fáil fúthu.  Beidh oifigigh i mo Roinnse i dteagmháil le CONCOS go luath chun na gnéithe seo a thabhairt chun críche.</p>

            <p eId="para_3376">A Notification of Intention to apply for Recognition of new primary school in Dublin 12 has been received from An Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna LanGhaeilge Teo (the Patron Body for Gaelscoileanna).  I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.  It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two-year timeframe.  In the interim, it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  Dublin 12 will be included in this process.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3391">Tá an Teachta ag tagairt do shuirbhé cuimsitheach a rinneadh i 2004 d'fhoireann riaracháin agus proifisiúnta mo Roinnse.  Ní dhearnadh suirbhé dá leithéid arís eile ó shin.  Comhlíonann mo Roinn riachtanais Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003.  Cuireann sí freagraí ar fáil trí Ghaeilge do chomhfhreagras i nGaeilge atá faighte aici.  Freagraíonn mo Roinn i nGaeilge glaoiteoirí ar mhian leo Gaeilge a labhairt, áit is féidir, nó geallann sí go nglaofaidh ball foirne le Gaeilge ar ais laistigh de lá oibre chun déileáil leis an bhfiafraí.  Foilsíonn mo Roinn foilseacháin corporáideacha i nGaeilge.  Cuireann an chigireacht seirbhís dhátheangach cigireachta ar fáil do gach bunscoil aitheanta, ina measc scoileanna Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoileanna.  Bíodh is gurb í an Ghaeilge an meán cumarsáide de ghnáth sna scoileanna Gaeltachta agus na Gaelscoileanna, braitheann an teanga a úsáideann an chigireacht ag am ar bith ar rogha na háite.  Ag an iarbhunleibhéal, cuireann an chigireacht ar fáil seirbhís i gcigireacht na Gaeilge féin.  Ó tugadh isteach scéim 2005-08 na Roinne faoi Alt 11 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003, tá na hathruithe seo a leanas tagtha i bhfeidhm maidir le rannán na cigireachta i mo Roinnse:</p>
            <p eId="para_3392">Sainaithníodh agus oileadh foireann ildisciplíneach de chigirí iarbhunscoile chun seirbhísí cigireachta agus measúnaithe i nGaeilge do scoileanna Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoileanna.  Seoladh clár den saghas céanna do chigirí bunscoile i 2007 agus 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3393">Mar chuid den chlár leanúnach bliantúil forbartha proifisiúnta don Chigireacht cuirtear ar fáil oiliúint i measúnú trí mheán na Gaeilge do chigirí bunscoile agus iarbhunscoile.</p>

Tá grúpa ball foirne riaracháin agus síceolaíochta ar féidir leo comhairle a thabhairt nó seirbhís a sheachadadh trí mheán na Gaeilge de réir mar is gá ar fud na tíre.  Tá suim i measc foireann mo Roinnse i scileanna a shealbhú sa Ghaeilge agus cabhraíonn an Roinn trí chúrsaí oiliúna do bhaill foirne chun a bpoitéinseal sa Ghaeilge a bhaint amach.  Is comhartha de seo an chaoi inar éascaigh aonad oiliúna agus forbartha mo Roinne le 67 ball foirne a rinne cúrsa Gaeilge i 2006, agus an chaoi inar mhéadaigh an líon sin go dtí 74 i 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_3400">A notification of intention to apply for recognition of the new primary school in Dublin 12 has been received from An Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna LánGhaeilge Teo, which is the patron body for Gaelscoileanna.  I have recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.  It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two-year timeframe.  In the interim, it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.  The forward planning section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  Dublin 12 will be included in this process.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3402">The school to which the Deputy refers is among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, which the action plan for educational inclusion. The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005 to 2010. There will be no opportunity before this to get included in the current DEIS programme of supports.  The school in question, together with 26 other primary and 73 post-primary schools, retained resources — teaching posts, including home-school community liaison posts, and financial resources — under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3403">When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the initiative.  While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on the schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate difficult decisions had to be made to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non-DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.  The main focus of social inclusion measures will be on retaining resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need.  This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as set out in his 2006 report on primary disadvantage, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3414">The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made in all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place, there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  As part of the expansion of the small schools scheme in 2007, a grant of €820,000 was allocated to Castlerock NS to enable the management authority to build a new three-classroom school.  I understand they are in discussions regarding the purchase of a site.  My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the new year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to funding mainstream classroom teachers, my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3415">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009-10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published.  It is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know  where they stand.  At this time, the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources to create staffing profiles for the school requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

         if due consideration will be given in respect of the case of person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 in relation to a higher education grant in view of the fact that this person is an applicant for citizenship, the fact that the application process for citizenship now stands at 30 months and the undue hardship involved for non-EU families.

            <p eId="para_3427">Any decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the relevant local authority, as appropriate.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in exceptional circumstances.  If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority.  If an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority, but remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3429">My Department asked the Office of Public Works to identify a suitable site for the school in question in September 2007.  My officials have recently been informed by the school authorities of the vacant building in question and will consult with the OPW regarding the availability of same.  The Deputy will appreciate that the acquisition of a site has to be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.  In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the school site at this time.</p>
