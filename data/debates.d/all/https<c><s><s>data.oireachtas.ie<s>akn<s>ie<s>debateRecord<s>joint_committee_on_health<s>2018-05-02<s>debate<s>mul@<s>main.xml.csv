Those who are at the bottom and those who are at the top have represent a purely random selection. We are meeting this morning with representatives of the Medical Council, the HSE, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in order to discuss recent media reports that suggest that some 650 medical consultants are not registered in the specialist division of the medical register. On behalf of the committee I would like to welcome Ms Rosarii Mannion and Professor Frank Murray on behalf of the HSE; Mr. Bill Prasifika and Dr. Anthony Breslin on behalf of the Medical Council; Dr. Tom Ryan and Mr. Martin Varley on behalf of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, and Dr. Peadar Gilligan and Mr. Anthony Owens on behalf of the IMO.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I also wish to advise that any opening statements made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	My name is Rosarii Mannion, national HR director of the HSE. I am joined by Professor Frank Murray, director for national doctors training and planning. I want to begin by thanking the Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today to discuss recent media reports that suggest that some 650 medical consultants are not registered in the specialist division of the medical register. In March 2008, the HSE amended the qualifications specified for consultant posts to require registration in the relevant specialist division of the register of medical practitioners at the Medical Council. The consultant contract 2008 reflects this requirement, the details of which were contained in HSE HR circular 021/2017 concerning qualifications required for consultant posts. The effect of this is that applicants who are not registered in the relevant specialist division cannot be appointed to a permanent consultant post in a HSE hospital or service or in a section 38 agency funded by the HSE. The rationale for the change was the imperative to ensure that consultants employed in the public health system have the appropriate training, skills, competences and qualifications to deliver care as assessed by the Medical Council, which has the statutory role of protecting the public by promoting the highest professional standards amongst doctors practising in the State. It remains the case that there are a number of consultants employed who are not registered in the relevant specialist division. As of 14 April, this number stood at 127 out of a consultant workforce of 2,977 whole-time equivalents, or 4.3% of the workforce. This number can be broken down into two main cohorts. The first cohort consists of consultants employed prior to 2008. There are 52 consultants in permanent employment who took up their posts before the introduction in 2008 of the contractual requirement to be registered in the relevant specialist division. This represents 1.7% of the consultant workforce. Of this number, 49 are employed in acute hospitals, one in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, and two in mental health services. The second cohort comprises consultants employed post 2008. There are 75 consultants currently in employment who took up posts since the introduction in 2008 of the contractual requirement to be registered in the relevant specialist division. They represent 2.5% of the consultant workforce and are on short-term specific purpose contract, SPC, basis, a short-term locum basis or are engaged through an agency. SPCs are used to fill permanent vacancies pending the filling of a new or replacement consultant post on a permanent basis after the necessary approval from the HSE’s consultants appointments advisory committee, the selection process at the Public Appointments Service for HSE posts or within the section 38 agency, and the post-recruitment formalities of reference-checking, Garda vetting, and pre-employment occupational health status assessment. Short-term locums are either employed directly by the HSE or section 38 agency, or are engaged through an agency in instances where cover is required for the annual leave of permanent consultants or for other temporary absences. It can often be the case that appropriately qualified consultants registered in the relevant specialist division do not present as applicants for short-term locum posts or for SPC posts pending the filling of a new or replacement permanent post. Service requirements have therefore led to the engagement of the consultants in this category. HR circular 21/2017 details requirements for consultant appointments. I have set out in the opening statement the breakdown by hospital group and community healthcare organisation, CHO, of where the consultants are appointed. I will not go through it, but the committee members have that information to hand. I will now outline measures to address the issue, starting with risk mitigation measures. The national clinical adviser and clinical programme group lead for mental health has sought and received assurances from the executive clinical directors in mental health services of risk mitigation measures, to include oversight of the practice of post-2008 consultants not in the specialist division. Similarly, within acute services, hospital managers and clinical directors have put in place monitoring arrangements appropriate to the circumstances of the practice of post-2008 consultants not in the relevant specialist division. A further measure consists of incentivising eligible pre-2008 consultants to apply for specialist registration. The acute services division and the mental health services division are working to establish which of the pre-2008 consultants would be eligible for registration in the relevant specialist division on the basis of their having completed higher specialist training or equivalent. As a once-off measure, the HSE will fund the Medical Council directly for the cost of the application process, such that the consultant will not incur any personal expenditure. I refer also to upskilling post-2008 consultants who have not completed higher specialist training. Colleagues in mental health are engaging with the Royal College of Psychiatrists to explore additional competence-based training for consultants to allow them to apply for specialist registration. This approach will be a more complex issue in the acute services, given the greater number of consultants involved, the greater number of specialties, the procedure-based nature of training in some of those specialties and the greater number of training bodies etc. The HSE is also minimising the timeline for filling new or replacement permanent consultant posts. Clinical directors in mental health services and acute services are seeking to clarify the position with each post-2008 consultant post currently filled, by definition on a non-permanent basis, in order to establish where the post is on the continuum from approval at the consultants advisory committee for a new or replacement post, to advertisement, to shortlisting and interviewing at the Public Appointments Service, to post-selection formalities undertaken by Health Business Services recruitment prior to the offer of a contract. The aim is to identify any impediments at any stage of this process with a view to elimination of these or otherwise to minimise the impact on the timeline for filling new or replacement permanent consultant posts. The hospital groups’ HR leads will work with the HSE national doctors training and planning’s doctors integrated management e-system, DIME, to access real-time data contained within DIME to allow full compliance with consultant specialist registration requirements and to ensure in the interim 100% compliance with the matching of approved posts on DIME to all occupied posts in the hospitals. The recent appointment of an interim chief clinical officer will assist the delivery system to address the issue. Addressing the issue is a key priority for the HSE. Work is ongoing between the HSE, Medical Council and training bodies to address issues which I anticipate will be concluded at the earliest opportunity. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	On behalf of the Medical Council, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health. I will say a few words about the role of the Medical Council, which is very relevant in the context of this discussion and recent media commentary. The Medical Council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of doctors in Ireland. Its purpose is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest standards among doctors. From the day a student first enters medical school until the day he or she retires from practice, the Medical Council works to ensure medical education and training remain up to date and are benchmarked to the highest international standards. The Medical Council sets standards for all undergraduate education and postgraduate training of doctors and also requires that all doctors fulfil ongoing professional competence requirements to ensure they keep their knowledge and skills up to date throughout their professional lives. The Medical Council provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners. The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor. Regarding relevant information about doctors' practice, each year the Medical Council, during the annual retention period when doctors renew their registration, seeks out additional self-declared information which we then use for the production of the medical workforce intelligence report, which provides a detailed overview of doctors’ practice in Ireland, including the exit rates of doctors, the density of doctors in Ireland by county and the globalisation of the workforce. Since 2012 the Medical Council has been seeking this additional information from registered medical practitioners to learn more about the scope of their practice. These reports have been developed not only to support the council’s work but also to inform wider health system planning and the evolution of systems of care. The detailed insights enabled through the workforce intelligence presented in these reports continue to highlight a number of key challenges, including retention of doctors, variances in skills mix and models of care and practice arrangements. Regarding doctors on the general division in hospital consultant roles, through sharing information about these challenges, the Medical Council looks to assist all bodies that shape the professional lives of doctors to ensure that the design, development and oversight of the medical workforce continues to foster good professional practice and to protect patients. This information is based on self-declarations and although the figure for doctors on the general division who describe themselves as hospital consultants seems quite high, once the figure is further examined and broken into its component parts, it reduces. As this question is based on self-declared information, it also includes doctors who are working outside Ireland, doctors in locum or temporary positions, doctors in acting-up positions, some doctors in training or further education, those currently not in a role etc. A number of doctors, who qualified as specialists before the new legislation, did not “grandfather” or transfer over to the specialist register in time, as they were entitled to. The latest medical workforce intelligence report is still in draft and due to be published in the coming months. However, we have taken the information most relevant to today’s meeting and have made it available to the members of the committee and to the other organisations presenting here, with a full breakdown of the figures. The supplementary information provided to the committee shows that 698 doctors on the general division have self-declared as hospital consultants in 2017. Delving further into the figures and removing a number of exclusions such as those working abroad, the number of general division doctors indicating that they practise in Ireland as hospital consultants is 254. Of the 254 doctors registered in the general division, 172 practice solely in Ireland with 149 of these working solely in publicly funded services. A total of 165 declared they work in both public and private settings, and 81 indicated that they have a mix of working inside and outside of Ireland. It is worth noting the term consultant is not defined under the Medical Practitioners Act, to which the council operates. Accordingly the employer is free to hire anyone they want as a consultant, with the only limitation being that the doctor is on the Medical Council register. However, a consultant cannot falsely represent themselves as a specialist if they are not on the specialist register. The council only enters those practitioners on the specialist division who have the requisite higher qualifications in that discipline. Doctors must be in compliance with maintenance of professional competence requirements and enrolled in a professional competence scheme relevant to their area of practice. A registered medical practitioner must maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis pursuant to a professional competence scheme applicable to that practitioner. The register of medical practitioners is a living database. Each working day at the Medical Council offices, doctors are entered in the register, are removed from the register and transferred between different parts of the register. The figures we have provided today are based on data from the 2017 retention period which is a snapshot from one moment in time. I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, President of the High Court, for further highlighting this issue recently and allowing the council to address the court on this topic on Monday. It is also worth highlighting that we are seeing a shift in the make-up of the medical registers which we maintain. The number of doctors on the specialist division is increasing and in 2017 the specialist division was larger than the general division for the first time which is a welcome development. I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the invitation to address them today. Both Mr. Prasifka and I are happy to address any questions members may have.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	I thank the Chairman and committee members for the opportunity to address them on the importance of specialist registration for hospital consultant appointments. The 2008 contract defines a consultant as a registered medical practitioner who by reason of his or her training, skill and expertise in a designated specialty, is consulted by other registered medical practitioners. It is worthwhile to review what is involved in training a consultant and why the integrity of this process is of such importance. The majority of medical students enter medical school after their leaving certificate examination and then complete a five-year course in medical college. This is followed by a year-long internship before progressing to sub-specialty training. In most sub-specialties doctors will complete two or three years of basic training to provide a foundation of specialist knowledge and to develop both as individuals and doctors. Then they complete five or six years of higher specialist training which is punctuated by specialist examinations, usually finishing with an exit examination and a professional qualification conferred by a recognised postgraduate college. Only at this point will a doctor become eligible for specialist registration, which is regarded as a basic qualification for doctors who wish to apply for a position as a consultant. I say basic because the vast majority of doctors who become eligible for inclusion in the specialist register will subsequently travel abroad, usually in order to gain clinical or research experience in a prestigious recognised international institution. This has been the pattern for many years, and is likely to continue, because consultants in Ireland wish to provide patient care to a recognised contemporary standard and wish to gain the experience in an early stage in their career that will act as a foundation for their subsequent profession. This model of training has several advantages for the healthcare system and for patients. In the past there was a consistent supply of well-trained and experienced consultants in the Irish health system. This was good for patients as they received the benefit of the consultants’ prolonged and sometimes arduous training. It was good for the health system as there was a continuous supply of talented consultants entering the health system, and these newer consultants brought with them fresh thinking, vision and new approaches to what, on occasion, seemed intractable problems.The health system also benefited as a whole because many of these motivated individuals became leaders within their professions and sub-specialties. As a collateral benefit, the quality of patient care in the health system consistently improved. The sustaining of these improved standards of care on a consistent basis now requires continuous recruitment of consultants who are trained to the highest international standards. If we deviate from this paradigm of training and recruitment, we are at risk of compromising the standard of patient care in our healthcare service and there will be inevitable and unacceptable consequences for patients. Therefore, at all stages of training we must foster a culture of academic achievement and clinical excellence in order that we can provide the best possible care for our patients. In our efforts to achieve clinical excellence we must insist that doctors who act as consultants in our healthcare system are appropriately trained in that they are deemed eligible for specialist registration. After all, this is the most basic of professional standards for doctors who wish to practise as consultants in Ireland. We cannot deviate from international best practice whereby doctors are required to comply with recognised specialty-specific training criteria in order that the quality and consistency of patient care is protected. Unfortunately, it has become apparent that these most basic standards are not being observed when filling an increasing number of consultant posts and there is a concern that this development is not in the best interests of patient care. There are similar concerns about the appointment of non-consultant hospital doctors who have trained in countries outside the EU and the EEA who are no longer required to pass Irish Medical Council examinations, a requirement which applied until recently. It was standard practice that doctors from some countries, following their intern year, completed the Medical Council's pre-registration examination system, PRES, clinical exam before they were deemed eligible to take up posts in the acute hospital services in Ireland. We are of the view that the public deserves to receive a consistent standard of care across all public hospital and mental health services based on a uniform standard of training. The failure to verify, by way of examinations, the basic and sub-specialty training and competencies is at odds with contemporary international practice in other European jurisdictions and English-speaking countries. There is a serious concern that, in the absence of Medical Council exams for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, inconsistent standards of medical training and competence will undermine the care patients receive. Overall, the concerns relating to the appointment to specialist consultant posts of doctors who are not eligible to be on the Irish Medical Council specialist register have the potential to compromise seriously the standards of care we provide to our patients in our healthcare system. That is our major concern.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	The IMO thanks the Chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Health for the invitation to discuss recent media reports which suggest that up to 650 doctors are employed as consultants without being registered on the specialist division of the register of medical practitioners. The figures in circulation from the Medical Council are self-declaration figures from 2015 of those who describe themselves as hospital consultants. The figures would also include some people who are abroad, are in training, have not been grandfathered to the specialist register, are in locum positions, are in acting-up roles and are temporary consultants. Ireland is a challenging place to work as a consultant. Significant capacity issues impact on a consultant's ability to provide safe quality care to patients. According to the health service capacity review, we require an additional 1,260 acute beds immediately and will likely require up to 7,000 hospital beds by 2031 in view of the current extent and pace of investment and reform. Bed occupancy rates in Irish hospitals have risen to an average of 97% and sit even higher, at an average of 104%, in model 4 hospitals, well above internationally recognised safe occupancy rates of 85%. The HSE full capacity protocol is now the norm, having been implemented on hundreds of occasions in 2017 in our major hospitals in Waterford, south Tipperary, Galway , Limerick, Cork and Beaumont. Constant overcrowding, cancellation of lists and rolling theatre closures impact not only on patient care, but also on the ability of trainee specialists to maintain and develop their skills. Hospital doctors in our health system work excessive hours and show high levels of stress and burnout. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's A National Study of Wellbeing of Hospital Doctors in Ireland showed that, on average, hospital doctors work 57 hours per week, and one in three shows symptoms of burnout. Antagonism of consultants by employers, politicians and the media adds to the poor morale of doctors. Reluctance on behalf of the Government to engage with doctors in a meaningful way and political interference in contractual disputes reflect the inadequate value our politicians place in the medical profession. I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words on specialist registration and the industrial relations environment. Doctors who have achieved specialist registration may practise independently without supervision and may present themselves as specialists. Attaining such registration is, and should be, the goal for trainee doctors in the health system. It should be a sine qua non for appointment to a consultant post that one should be so registered. We have no doubt but that among this group of consultants who do not currently have specialist registration are many fine and committed doctors who do their utmost to deliver patient care in the most trying of circumstances, in a system starved of capacity and resources and where crisis management appears to be the default setting. Nonetheless, the practice of appointing doctors who do not hold the correct registration to consultant posts is inappropriate and should cease. Patients who require specialist care should receive it from a registered specialist. There are potentially significant indemnity issues that arise from non-specialist doctors working as consultants in an under-resourced and overstretched health service. Consultant-delivered care, it is worth reminding ourselves, is associated with better clinical outcomes for patients, increased patient safety and more efficient use of healthcare resources. However, we strongly contend that this present issue is just part of a wider problem, one which has culminated in the Irish public health service not being the employer of choice for medical personnel, and the profoundly concerning circumstance in which consultant posts are advertised but not filled. This was the case with 22 of 84 closed consultant recruitment campaigns in 2016. Why has this come about? It is important to go back to basics. The current consultant contract, to which I have already alluded, contains a series of pay promises that were not honoured and that are now the subject of costly litigation. No other group of public servants who had signed contracts in good faith would ever be treated in this fashion. Furthermore, consultant salaries were unilaterally and unfairly reduced by 30% in 2012. Again, no other group of public servants was singled out and treated in this fashion. While the work of the IMO has ameliorated much of the effects of this cut, the price that we had to pay was a longer pay scale with lower starting and finishing points and very significant reduction in pensions for consultants appointed since 2012. Less well remembered from that time were attempts by the then Minister for Health to introduce a consultant level 1 role that would sit below the existing consultant cohort. This strain of thinking, viewing consultants not as a valuable resource but as an obstacle to be overcome, continues to influence and infect policy-making today. The health service, however, suffered dreadful reputational damage. Why would highly trained specialists who operate in a global market work in a system that could dismiss their contractual entitlements in such an offhand fashion? It is for this very reason that 450 consultant posts, posts for which there once would have been fierce competition, now lie vacant or are filled on a temporary basis only. When taken in the context of our comparative shortage of doctors, we have 2.9 practising physicians per 100,000 population, compared to an EU average of 3.4 per 100,000 population. This should be profoundly troubling for any party interested in health service delivery. In a recent IMO survey, over one quarter of consultants indicated that they were considering taking up a post abroad in the foreseeable future, while over 70% believe that their remuneration, training supports and access to colleagues would be improved by moving abroad. In summary, we have a public health system which struggles to recruit doctors into consultant posts and which struggles increasingly to retain those doctors once appointed. This is the backdrop against which non-specialists are appointed to specialist posts. Long hours, poor access to supports and inability to deliver the type of care for which consultants have trained have served to turn a generation of talented medics off the idea of working in the Irish public health service. We cannot afford to alienate these doctors. This is because there are approximately 2,700 consultants in the public system, when the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing recommended a figure of 4,400. However, patients must be seen, and the service requires that consultant appointments be made.It must never be the responsibility of the patient to determine whether their specialist is in fact a specialist; that is the responsibility of the employer. Patients must have confidence that their consultant is a specialist and that the care they receive is of the appropriate standard.  I will finish with a quote from the consultant survey that the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, conducted last year. We gave respondents the opportunity to provide us with a comment. Many of those comments were eye-opening, but the one that struck me most was provided by a recently appointed consultant, who wrote:I would resign now, except that I have to pay a mortgage and provide for my family. I’m sorry I came back. The blocks to specialist recruitment to consultant posts must be addressed as a matter of urgency.

Dr. Breslin has clarified that and Dr. Gilligan has also referred to it. Perhaps the witnesses could clarify the figures, because it is obvious that many of those doctors are not practising in Ireland even though they are on the register, hence the disparity. The HSE said in February of this year that 73 consultants were not on the specialist register. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association said there were 81 such consultants in October 2017. The figures have changed again and now stand at 127. Can the witnesses clarify the extent of the issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	The figure is a live figure. People register and de-register for a number of reasons. The number of doctors on the general register indicating that they practice in Ireland as consultants is 254. That figure covers the public and private sectors. Of those, 165 say they practise in both public and private services, and 149 indicated that they work as hospital consultants in the public service only. Under that 149, approximately 62 people were working as consultants and employed as such before 2008, before specialist registration was enacted in the 2007 Act. Those people had the opportunity to go on the specialist register, to "grandfather" across because they had experience, but they did not do so for one reason or another. The council is in discussion with the HSE about that number of individuals, as the HSE has mentioned. There is then a balance of people who started post-2008 and who have not completed formal specialist training and are not entitled to be on the specialist register at present, unless they are assessed in another fashion. I hope that clarifies some of the numbers. The numbers will vary slightly depending on when they are looked at because of the live nature of the register.

My understanding is that the number of medical practitioners registered in Ireland is approximately 18,000, of whom approximately 39% are non-Irish graduates. Can the witnesses provide a more accurate figure? For those who have come to Ireland, perhaps even from outside of Europe, who completed part of their training outside Ireland, is there a process to follow to get onto the specialist register here? What do they have to do? My understanding is that Irish graduates will get on the specialist register after a five-year programme and then move on to the consultant posts, but my question relates to people who come to Ireland with three or four years of training outside Ireland and who want to enter the Irish system. How do those people get on the specialist register, if they want to stay in Ireland?  I also want to raise the issue of the grandfather clause. I spoke to a person a number of months ago who was employed pre-2008. That person has made a number of attempts, through that person's specialist area, to get onto the specialist register and on each occasion, was told that people were not aware of what the process was. In the last 12 months that person has been in contact with the Medical Council to ask what the process was. That person was advised by the Medical Council that it did not have a process for getting on the specialist register for someone who took up a job pre-2008. Can that be clarified? What is the process for people who were employed pre-2008 who are not now on the specialist register but who have been practising for quite a long time in this country? Those people are saying to me that the Medical Council has advised that it is not aware of the process in place. Perhaps the people who not on the specialist register of whom the witnesses are aware could be communicated with to advise them what the process is. The information I have is that these people do not know what the process is and that the Medical Council was not able to advise them. The institutions they work for were unable to assist them either. Perhaps the witnesses can clarify. For those who are post-2008, I presume there would be no difficulty in communicating with them to advise what the process is. Has there been communication with those people to date or will it be done at this stage?  A specialist training programme was set up where people are on the programme for a number of years, go through the system and are then entitled to apply for consultant posts here. Of the number who have come through the training process under the specialist training programme over the past ten years, what percentage have stayed in Ireland? Does that programme now need to be reviewed in order to keep people in Ireland? I know that both the IMO and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, have said that part of the problem is pay and conditions but are there other issues we need to look at to make sure we can retain the maximum number of people possible in this country?

The word "consultant" is not defined under the Medical Practitioners Act. Is it the case that a self-declared consultant is not recognised by the Medical Council, given that the word is not defined in the first instance? What system is in place to close the loophole between the specialist division and the self-declared consultants? Those who are not registered in the relevant specialist division cannot be appointed to a permanent position in a HSE hospital or a section 38 agency. What is the position with regard to section 39 employees? As of 14 April, 127 consultants are still not registered in the relevant specialist workforce. As consistency surely is imperative, why has nothing been done to date to rectify this? Dr. Ryan stated most specialist doctors who become consultants are required to complete two to three years of basic specialist training. How then is the term "self-declared consultant" acceptable given the extent of the training the others must do? Are doctors filling vacancies to make up numbers as opposed to having been adequately trained for the positions they fill? I ask Dr. Gilligan the extent to which this ambiguity is affecting the day-to-day running of hospitals. The current bed situation and hospital overcrowding has an obvious impact on medical staff in any event. To what extent is this impacting on patient safety?

I was asked about overseas graduates entering specialist training. There is a difference between EU and non-EU graduates. EU graduates have an automatic right to enter basic specialist training and then higher specialist training as long as they do their entry exams and so on along the way and are appropriately assessed. For non-EU graduates, it is a more complex programme. They must have a certificate of equivalent experience to the Irish internship. We have that in place for a number of countries including Pakistan, for those people who started their internships after January 2009, Sudan, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa after 1 July 2006, and Malaysia, the UK and Malta. That was set up under the Act and the council has to consider the equivalent certificate of experience and that would exempt the applicant from doing the examination. In order to deal with the significant number of people trying to register in Ireland, we established an adjudication group with representatives from Ireland and overseas to determine the requirements to ensure we had a high standard of doctors finishing their internships before we would register them here. After reviewing evidence based on the quality of medical schools, quality of internships, the time taken and type of work done, the adjudication group recommended that internships undertaken in the countries I mentioned met the council's standards. In addition, a person seeking to take up a training post in Ireland must have performed a higher examination. He or she must demonstrate a level of education and training above the internship. The current situation is disadvantageous to a number of doctors working in Ireland in that they have sufficient qualifications to work here but, due to legislation, they do not qualify to get onto training schemes. One can have two doctors working on the same clinical team, one of whom is on a formal training scheme run by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland or the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland while the other is not eligible for that scheme. We have had representations from a number of junior doctors and countries like Nigeria and India to try to deal with this. The proposed amendments to the Act, which have been agreed between the council and the Department of Health, would get rid of that variation and allow those who are working here and providing good service to the country access to the training scheme. It would also help the public by encouraging those people who are doing a job here to stay in the long term. A lot of them come here to try to get on a training scheme. When they cannot, they leave to go to Australia, Canada and so on. As such, we are losing a valuable resource there. I hope that clarifies matters. Senator Colm Burke referred to people pre-2008 who did not grandfather across and who are now seeking to get onto the specialist register. We have a standard process to assess these individuals. That process is available on our website. When someone makes an application, he or she is told what documents and evidence are required. That comes to the council and the documentation and evidence are provided to the relevant postgraduate training body for surgeons, psychiatrists or physicians, which reviews the documentation and reverts to the council with a recommendation for the registration committee, which I chair. As such, I know the process. While the process is predicated on a person being in training today, we make allowances for the fact that someone might have trained a number of years ago. We take into consideration the fact that conditions and requirements were different in 2002 than today. In some situations, a college assessing an application might consider that by today's standards, an applicant does not meet the requirements for specialist registration. In committee meetings, however, we consider the evidence the doctor has sent to us and consider what was in place when he or she was in training. On a significant number of occasions, we have agreed to recommend that those people go on the specialist register. Such a recommendation goes to the full council meeting for approval. In a small number of situations, there might be a reason the doctor cannot be registered on the specialist register. In such situations, a doctor has a right of appeal and can go before an assessment group and that assessment will go to the whole council, which can make a recommendation. There is a clear process and we are cognisant of the issues for someone who trained a number of years ago. We make allowances for that. People coming to the country post-2008 go through the same assessment process. We also make allowances for what training they have done and when they have done it. Again, the assessment goes out to the relevant postgraduate training bodies and comes back to my committee where we will make a final decision. Again, while we make allowances for people who have trained in different locations and at different times, we try to ensure they meet the relevant standard to practice in today’s environment in Ireland. All of that information is available on the council's website. Some people can be put off by the requirements regarding relevant evidence and documentation. For instance, if someone worked in the UK or Australia 15 years ago, it may be difficult to get proof that he or she worked in a certain hospital or carried out certain procedures. However, we make allowances for that. If there is any way for us to assist a doctor to achieve specialist registration where we think it is appropriate, we have no issue doing it. If the Senator feels we should communicate that to doctors and make it more visible on our website, we have no issue doing that. Senator Colm Burke's final question was on the percentage of doctors who train in Ireland and leave. I cannot provide a figure off the top of my head but we know it is an issue. Some doctors do their basic training and then leave before they do their higher training. Some doctors leave after their internships while others complete their higher training but leave due to issues around consultant recruitment and get consultant posts overseas. We are trying to assess those numbers at present but I cannot give the Senator a figure off the top of my head.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	The specific figure I am looking for is the number of those people who have completed the senior training.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	I understand. I do not have that figure to hand but I will get it to the Senator as soon as possible.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	On the percentage of doctors who have completed specialty training and stayed, we cannot provide the figure right now. However, a great deal of work has been done on this topic of doctor emigration. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has a doctor emigration project and it is something in which all stakeholders are actively involved.We will endeavour to forward to the committee the best information we have in this regard. Deputy Murphy O'Mahony correctly stated that "consultant" is not a defined term under the Medical Practitioners Act. This is not surprising because the Medical Practitioners Act does not give the Medical Council a role in the employment status of doctors within the health system. It also does not give the Medical Council the status of regulator of hospitals or employers. If it did, we would be a very different body with different powers and, presumably, very different resources. In terms of the doctors who are self declared, the self-declaration does not give them any status. The workforce intelligence report, which we compile and has been well received by stakeholders, is a snapshot of, and a source of information about, the medical workforce. It is very useful, particularly when we know there are lots of stresses and strains in that workforce and very high emigration. It is a useful tool but, in and of itself, it does not confer any status on anyone. What we are discussing is to how to uphold standards in the profession. Obviously, the Medical Council would be, and is, extremely concerned if consultant posts are not being filled by people who meet the specialist qualification.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	22	The remaining questions were for the other stakeholders.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	On Senator Colm Burke's question of whether communication has issued, in terms of the cohort of the public health sector about which we are speaking now, there are 127. We are case managing those on an individual basis to assist and support the relevant doctors to come through this process as appropriate. This is happening at hospital group level. With the appointment of our interim chief clinical officer we will have greater visibility at a central level and we will be attending to that in a very focused way. Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked if a similar process is in place for the section 39 agencies. By way of clarification, because I would not like to mislead the committee, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, employees can acquire a contract of indefinite duration. Within the cohort post-2008, we have ten that will acquire a contract of definite duration. In terms of the section 39 agencies, as the Deputy will be aware - this has been the subject of discussion by this committee - section 39 staff are not our employees. However, a similar process should apply and we do part-fund some of those agencies.  On the Deputy's second question of why nothing has been done to date, I do not accept that. It might not be visible, but quite a lot has been done to date. I have previously referenced the report commissioned by our director general and chaired by Professor Frank Keane: Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention, which was published in February 2007 and is available on our website, which I can share with the committee. It picked up on this issue as one for us to address. It is also on the organisation's risk register at the most senior level. We are attending to it but we need to progress it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	I always believe more can be done and more will be done. I am confident that we will be in a stronger position come December in terms of the level of focused attention on this particular issue. On the point regarding the medical workforce, from February to date we have grown our medical workforce by 98 additional consultants and 288 additional NCHDs. Notwithstanding that we are growing our medical workforce and moving in the right direction, I accept that as per the capacity review that has been referenced we need to do grow it further with greater speed and efficiency. We are picking up the issues around recruitment and hope to focus more on the retention issues etc. through the good offices of my colleague, Professor Frank Murray. To alleviate any doubt, there is quite a lot happening.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked about the day-to-day impact of this issue on hospitals and whether it is impacting in terms of overcrowding and patient safety. The question is why do we have 450 vacant consultant posts throughout the country. The reason for this is clear - Ireland is not regarded as an attractive place to work. Why is that? It is because we have a dishonoured consultant contract, significant cuts to consultants' pay, at three times that of all other public sector workers, and because consultants, particularly surgical colleagues, looking at potentially taking up a position in Ireland are finding that there is no operating theatre time available to them in the hospitals to which they are to be appointed or there is no outpatient clinical available to them. They also may not have the administrative support they require or they not have a team to provide the care that they wish to provide. As a result, they are choosing to remain where they are, which may be Canada, America, Australia or the UK and the patients of Ireland are missing out on this talent. This is a very real impact. In regard to the unfilled consultant posts, it is fair to say that services are not being provided to patients. As I have stated previously in this committee, patients who require stroke care are not receiving it in as timely a manner as they would if there was a consultant in post. Patients requiring surgery are waiting longer because we do not have the number of surgeons that we need to provide the care.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	They are very definitely being impacted, which is why it is key that we address this matter with a level of urgency.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	Deputy Murphy O'Mahony also asked about the training period. Most young people, when they qualify as a doctor and finish their internship, need time to find their feet. They need time to consider what they want to do long term. It is generally at this point that doctors would do two years of general training, usually in medicine. They then enter some specialty training. Following the sub-specialty training, they go abroad to round off their professionalism and to gain more experience. A problem arises when in the two years before they get into specialist training they go abroad. When they finish their specialist training they will go abroad. Whereas the system here almost shuns junior doctors or doctors in training, when they go abroad they are embraced with open arms. If they want to do more work and treat more patients they are given access to the resources, staff and administrative support they need to do so. I know from direct personal experience of going abroad that when doctors go abroad they are treated very well. If one wants to treat more patients everyone is delighted and one is given immediate access to whatever one wants. There is no delay. Doctors from experience at home know that the system is not conducive to providing excellence, either clinical, academic or training. Young talented people see the disconnect between what is possible abroad and what pertains at home and they take a message from it. They are not valued at home but they are valued abroad and so they emigrate. We are exporting fully trained doctors to the rest of the world such that our health system is dependent on foreign-trained doctors. We import doctors from poorer countries. We take into our health care system doctors who have been trained in developing and Third World countries and as such we are not doing their countries of origin any justice. At the same time, we are exporting large numbers of fully trained, confident medical professionals to thrive and practice abroad.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	To add to what Dr. Ryan said, currently there are approximately 200 Irish trained doctors who completed their intern year last year working in hospitals in Perth. This is replicated across other parts of the English speaking world.The major concern we have is that they are not coming back, they are remaining and going on to other posts and completing their training abroad. We are training a sufficient number of doctors at graduate level, but we are losing them. The key question is why that is the case. I have been in this post for approximately ten years, but prior to that I worked as a civil servant in the Department of Finance. During a previous recession, we had a golden rule in the Civil Service at the time that in spite of the financial difficulties the State would not breach contracts. If I were to reflect on the past ten years, I would say the root cause of this problem is the fact that the State and the health service management is party to persistent and blatant breaches of contracts. The examples are fairly obvious, the 2008 contract which was agreed with consultants ten years ago still has not been honoured. It has been ignored. That is sending a very negative message to professionals who are in very high demand internationally. To sum up, it means that the longer serving consultants today, partly because of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, but also significantly because of the breach of contract are being paid 30% less than they should have been if the contract was honoured effective from 1 June 2009. The new entrant consultants are being paid 45% less than was agreed practically ten years ago. Of course, other jurisdictions have moved on in the interim and they have been increasing salaries. The big difference is that highly trained professionals are embraced in other jurisdictions and in other hospital settings whereas, unfortunately, the opposite is the case here. To resolve this problem one has to address and resolve those issues, the breach of contract and the discrimination against new entrants. I think that is the key to the resolution of the problem. We did not have that problem prior to those two developments.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	Unfortunately, from where we sit, that issue is being ignored. It is the central issue. An employer knows that one must honour contracts with employees, if one hopes to retain them and recruit. That issue is being ignored and has been ignored for several years. The problem is increasing because of it. I cannot understand how profession HR management would ignore such a central issue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	I thank the Chairman. What Mr. Varley is referring to is the subject of court action at present so it would be inappropriate to respond in any great detail on the issue at this forum. Suffice to say there is no intention on the employer's behalf to dishonour contracts at all or to undervalue any member of our staff.

I will now address a question to Professor Murray. Are sufficient numbers of people coming into the training programmes in Ireland and are we losing them once they have qualified?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	I thank the Chairman for inviting us to appear before the committee today. People are lost at all stages from the training programme both here and abroad. It is not just an Irish issue. The problem is particularly marked here, especially after internship where many doctors go away, as Mr. Varley said, and a proportion do not come back and then particularly at the end of higher surgical training, HST. I personally believe that we urgently need to attack the issue of recruitment and retention. It is a fundamental issue and feeds back to many of the other issues that create unhappiness from consultant to trainee consultant level. Some of those steps include making Ireland a very good place to work. Other improvements include optimising the process of appointing consultants so that it is a kind of one-stop-shop rather than having a number of steps and reducing as much as we can isolated or silo thinking and joining things up as best we can. I argue that we are losing trainees at all stages and that we should make the end, that is being a consultant or a general practitioner, so attractive that people want to stay rather than leave.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	I welcome our guests. I was very interested in the very desolate picture painted by Dr. Peadar Gilligan and others. It is true and we all understand the difficulties in filling posts throughout the health services. Some of the issues have been in existence for years, even before the downturn in the economy. I served on one health board and I can recall distinctly posts being left unfilled for some considerable time because it was not possible to find suitably qualified people to fill the positions. I think it is exacerbated by some of the contracts on offer in other countries. It is possible to get a two or three year tax-free lucrative contract in the Middle East. We cannot compete in this jurisdiction with that. We need to bear that in mind. I take the point made by Dr. Gilligan that we tend to dumb down the morale and the quality of the services in Ireland by constantly criticising them, even where criticism is not warranted. That is not taking away from the fact that we do have the right to a good reliable health service that we can be proud of. We want that to happen.  We need to understand that all staff throughout the public service suffered salary cuts. It was a very sad thing at the time to break contracts. The options available at that time are well known. I am not making excuses for it, but the fact of the matter is that the entire public sector was assessed to ascertain the extend to which economies could be made. The cuts were drastic and severe, but I would like that to be borne in mind. There is a figure of 450 vacancies; has that figure increased or decreased in the past number of years? Is the number of unfilled vacancies rising, as would appear to be the case? Can the non-EU graduates who are available practise in practise in any other EU country? A number of graduates cannot get a place on a training scheme and I would like to know the main reasons for that and how has that number fluctuated in the past couple of years. Has the number increased or decreased? In the case of practitioners who have not completed their registration but are practising, does that in any way affect insurance cover in so far as insurance underwriting in the health services is concerned? Has there been any noticeable difference in the number of legal challenges against those who have not completed their registration as consultants and those who have?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	I will respond to Deputy Durkan's question on whether non-EU graduates registered in Ireland can practise in other countries.If a non-EU graduate is registered here, that does not give him or her an automatic right to practise elsewhere in the EU. He or she would have to register with that individual country. If someone was registered here and wanted to practise in Portugal, for example, he or she would have to register in Portugal. Portugal would be subject to the same EU regulation about registering them as we are here.

Do they have to have individual registration in each country or is it general-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	46	Each country requires its own individual registration. If an Irish graduate went to Portugal, as long as he or she meets basic criteria, he or she would be automatically registered in Portugal, for example. If the graduate had to go to Australia, America or Canada, since there are different registration processes are different, the graduate would have to meet different criteria. An Irish graduate would have an easier time registering in an EU country but every country has to have an individual registered in that country. If someone is practising in Portugal, that person has to be registered in Portugal.

I am conscious of the cost of the services and the fact that we are not the lowest spenders on health generally, but we may be the lowest spenders on consultant posts. That is a query.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	The UK is having issues with recruitment. I think that is more due to Brexit than other reasons. Many other countries have their own internal issues with recruitment.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	49	People who emigrate to Dubai or Abu Dhabi, that is, graduates who want experience and presumably want to do the best they can for themselves have a choice. They can go to Australia, the United States and do the registration and whatever else. The choices are to go to the Middle East or to Australia. What is the difference there? How can we compete with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	It is very difficult for us to compete with everything there. Young people nowadays tend to have wanderlust. They want to travel and get experience. As previous speakers have said, some of them go abroad for a number of years then come back and start training here. That might have been the intention of others but once they go abroad, they stay abroad. The same thing applies to the UK. People are going to Australia, Canada etc. That is a common issue for a number of EU countries.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	51	The choices are quite wide. North America is wide open for an Irish graduate. It is a huge medical market. It is worth putting the scale of this problem in context. We have approximately 1.1 consultants per 1,000 population. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average is 1.8. We are approximately 40% or 50% lower than we should be and many of the consultant posts we have are unfilled, while some are filled by doctors who are not registered as specialists and who may not be qualified to act as specialists. There is an enormous problem here. For us to provide complex, sophisticated healthcare to a contemporary international standard, we will have to greatly expand the number of consultants we have. We cannot even fill the posts advertised at the moment. It is not just the Middle East that offers superior contracts. It is Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	53	English-speaking countries. They embrace Irish medical graduates with open arms. It is not that we cannot compete with these people. We do not have a choice - we have to. We cannot set out to fail.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	The Deputy referred to how there has been difficulty filling consultant posts in certain circumstances for a long time. The issue now is the length of time that consultant posts lie vacant and the number of applicants for the posts that are advertised. The number of applicants for many posts can be quite low. Some posts get no applicants. It can be difficult to put together a panel from which to appoint somebody.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	55	There are no applicants for some posts? Are those posts particularly unattractive and, if so, for what reason?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	56	We made a fairly detailed submission to the Public Service Pay Commission on this. There are issues which we survey which revolve around remuneration, access to supports, administrative supports, surgery and clinical time, and so on. There is a variety of issues. There is no one reason why every post is unattractive. It is post-specific in many cases. The Deputy mentioned that doctors go abroad, including the Middle East. The people we would look to bring in as consultants, the Irish-trained doctors, would tend not to go to the Middle East. They would be more likely to go to the UK, Canada or Australia. They would pay tax in those jurisdictions but they would also have access to a far greater range of supports, work shorter hours and so on. There are other factors around that. There are remuneration issues too. The Deputy asked if the number of empty consultant posts is going up or down. The figure is probably tipping up slightly. It includes temporary and short-term appointments, which is part of the reason that we are here today, discussing this. I will finish on the Middle East. We have found that doctors, at later stages in their careers, are more inclined to go to the Middle East. It is an issue for general practice more so, in our experience, than for hospital doctors.

I ask Deputy Donnelly to come in, if that is okay, and we will come back to Mr. Varley.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	58	I will bring the conversation back to what the committee was for today. We are talking about doctors going to the Middle East and I know it is related but the committee meeting today is about doctors working as consultants in Ireland who are not on the specialist register. That is why we are here. We are all aware of the CervicalCheck scandal that has emerged over the last few days. It is causing a lack of confidence between the public and their doctors. It is clear, in the case of Vicky Phelan, that her doctor knew about not a false negative but a missed screening of cancer in 2011, did not tell her and did not want to tell her. We know that 13 other hospitals had doctors who did not share the information. It is fracturing trust between the public and their doctors. There are big issues to ask about the level of trust between doctors and the HSE. That is where we are this week. We hear that not only may patients now be worried that their doctors are not sharing everything with them but that their consultant is not a consultant. What we have heard this morning is shocking. A professional organisation states "it has become apparent that these most basic [professional] standards are not being observed when filling an increasing number of consultant posts and there is a [grave] concern that this development is not in the best interests of patient care." That is what we are here to talk about. Who is responsible for this? Is it the Medical Council? Is it the HSE? Is it the Department? Is there another body that we are not aware of? I understand that there are no legal definitions for consultants but for specialists. In the eyes of the public, in layman's terms, people hear that their consultant may not be a consultant. Whose responsibility is it to make sure that, when a member of the public is referred to a consultant, that man or woman is in fact a registered consultant?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	59	I might address that. If one looks at the situation today, approximately 127 doctors are not on the specialist register who are working as consultants in the public service. As we have heard already, 52 antedate 2008 when it was not a requirement and ten are permanent people in consultant posts since then. It reflects that there is a serious challenge in recruiting consultants in Ireland.

This morning, we are trying to have a conversation about specialists being registered and it moves off to why it is so difficult to hire doctors. I do not mean to cut across Professor Murray but, in the interests of time, can I get an answer to the question?I do not want to get into a conversation on why it is hard to hire doctors. I know the reasons and acknowledge it is a very important conversation. Who has the responsibility in this country to make sure that when a member of the public goes to see his or her consultant, that the consultant is, in fact, a registered consultant or specialist?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	61	I believe the employers are supposed to make sure that these individuals are on the specialist division of the register. In practice, it turns out that 127 are not and they are employed through the hospitals or the mental health services. I will not return to the general point but it is important to view this matter in those terms. These are difficult-to-recruit posts within a broader issue of recruitment and retention. Not only are there 120 individuals like this, there are 450 posts that are unfilled. Of the posts advertised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, last year or 2016, a quarter were unfilled.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	62	I appreciate that point. I acknowledge that recruitment and retention is a really important conversation but that is not what I asked about. Thus far, the answer that has been given to my question is that it is the doctor's employer. Who is a doctor's employer? Is it the hospital? Is it the HSE? Who ultimately is accountable for what is happening? Is it individual hospitals?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	I think it is individual hospitals and individual mental health services that directly employ the individuals. Ms Mannion is an expert on this subject and I will ask for her advice but I think they are the direct employers.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	64	I thank Professor Murray for his answer. Do we have a situation in Ireland where a rogue hospital could, because of the severe difficulties in hiring specialists, start employing unqualified people, put them in specialist roles and present them to the public as specialists? Is that possible? Is there no higher authority in the State, within the Medical Council, the Department of Health, the HSE or anywhere else, whose job it is to make sure that hospitals do not hire people who are not qualified as specialists or consultants?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	Clearly, the employer has obligations around recruitment and the hiring of staff. The HSE operates under licence from the Commission for Public Service Appointments. We have a process of audit around all recruitment. In terms of individual hospitals, it is very easy for us to itemise where the consultants are located. When hospitals hire staff they hire them to their specific competence. It is a matter of public knowledge and record whether staff are on any given register. Any member of the public can look up the register and see the qualification level of the consultant treating him or her. In terms of individual hospitals, as the employer the hospital certainly can go ahead and undertake its own recruitment. As I said, it is under licence. It is regulated. Anybody who is issuing a contract will make sure that if mitigation measures, supervisory measures, teamwork etc. are required, they are in place.

I refer to the specific issue of the public walking in to see consultants who are not consultants. We have evidence from an opening statement provided by one of the professional bodies stating "the most basic professional standards are not being observed." Who has the responsibility to ensure that the most basic professional standards are observed, such as consultants actually being consultants? Is that the responsibility of the HSE?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	81	Yes, it is.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	The requirements for consultant appointments and qualifications changed in 2008.

How long has the HSE known? We have a report that 650 so-called consultants operate as specialists in this country but are not on the specialist register and the Medical Council has walked us through the figures. If the HSE is responsible for making sure that doctors are actually doctors, how long has the HSE known that specialist doctors are not specialist doctors in some cases?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	I have been aware of this issue since September 2015.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	For clarification, the Deputy asked me the direct question as to how long was I aware of the issue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	I answered the Deputy's question honestly and truthfully.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	94	Yes
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	I am aware of the specific issue since September 2015. That was the time when I came into post, as the national human resources director, and I began looking at the issue around consultant recruitment, appointment and retention. I engaged with colleagues in the national doctors training and planning unit. I made sure that we put in integrated management electronic systems to make sure these issues were picked up. I am acutely aware of the matter since that time because it has been part of my role to be aware of it since September 2015.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	96	Yes. It was part of the role of Ms Mannion's predecessor to be aware of the matter too. From the perspectives of Ms Mannion and ourselves, it is great that she came in and found this issue. From the public's perspective, it should not matter who is in the role within the HSE. My next question is not specifically directed at Ms Mannion. When did the HSE become aware that we had non-specialist doctors acting in specialist roles? We have evidence from the professional bodies that such a situation comes with serious patient concerns and safety concerns. How long has the HSE known about this matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	The choice for the HSE, in some of these circumstances, is whether it provides a service in a safe way and recruit a doctor to a specific role with all the risk mitigations that may be necessary, or not, to provide a service. That can be a decision around providing a service, or not providing a service.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	I can clarify that. As I have said, I am aware of this issue since September 2015. As for how long the HSE has been aware of it, I will clarify the matter. I would say, with a high degree of confidence, that the HSE is aware of the issue since the qualifications changed in 2008. I would be surprised if it were not but I am happy to clarify the matter.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	101	A number of circulars have issued with regard to this specific issue. Circulars Nos. 14/2009, 8/2010, 9/2012, 21/2015 and 16/2017 specify the employer's position regarding this issue. I am happy to furnish the circulars to the committee.

As many as 415 posts have not been filled and 127 posts have been filled by those who are not on the specialist register. Am I correct that were the non-specialist doctors not in position, then there would be no service provided by the 127 consultant posts?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	The point Ms Mannion made is correct. Frequently, service providers such as hospitals or mental health services, must make a decision about whether to provide no service or to provide a service with somebody who is not on the specialist division of the register acting at consultant level who frequently, I think, has comparable experience, if not certified training, with those individuals who have registered with the Medical Council on the specialist division of the register. That is one of the issues that is quite important to think about. They are not doctors who, in my experience, do not have relevant experience and training. They are doctors who do not have certification in that regard, which is different. As Ms Mannion has outlined, they work in a slightly different environment where there is more mentoring rather than stand-alone work, as consultants tend to work. It is worth thinking about where these posts are located. They are mainly in smaller level 3 and 4 hospitals, in community mental health services and in hard-pressed specialties such as anaesthesia, surgery and medicine. When there is a recruitment and retention issue, which we have discussed, one will see the crises most obvious in areas that are difficult to recruit into in Ireland, which mirrors the situation abroad.There was a question as to whether this pertains anywhere else. Scotland has a much worse recruitment and retention issue than we have. They have an awful lot of posts unfilled. Frequently, it is the remoteness and the unattractiveness, or the relatively less attractive nature, of the specialty that has worsened the recruitment and retention crisis and put pressure on the service to provide alternatives.

It is the HSE which signs off on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	105	I am not sure that it signs off. I think these are mainly locally appointed rather than centrally appointed. If we think about how consultants are appointed into permanent, long-term posts, they go through a very rigorous process involving either the hospitals, the Public Appointments Service, PAS or the mental health services. People who are appointed to locum or specific-purpose contract positions do not go through that same process. It does not have the same number of steps within it.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	106	Sorry, I interrupted Deputy Donnelly.

From the public's perspective, we have heard about CervicalCheck. Doctors are withholding important information from patients in some cases to the point that, when referring to the ethical duty of consultants and activities relating to CervicalCheck, the Taoiseach said in the Chamber yesterday that the guidelines "are not optional and doctors may be struck off for not following them". We have heard today that there are non-consultant hospital doctors who are not sitting the exams and that there are also non-consultant hospital doctors who we bring into this country, who are good enough to work in our hospitals but who are not worthy of further training. We have a bizarre system of apartheid within our hospital system whereby we have one hospital doctor from Pakistan, Sudan or South Africa who is allowed to train and another from Japan, South Korea or Canada who is not allowed to train. These are serious issues. In terms of what we are hearing with regard to, for example, a member of the public believing he or she is talking to a specialist in circumstances where that individual is not, in fact, a specialist, will the professional bodies and the Medical Council indicate if there is a clinical risk involved or if this is simply an administrative issue?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	There were some comments recently that this, to some extent, was about mitigating risk. However, that is not a culture of excellence. It is not a culture of providing the best possible care that the patient deserves. I have commented that risk could be mitigated by mentoring but many of the people who are appointed to consultant posts and who are not on the specialist register are appointed in smaller, more remote hospitals where the possibilities of mentoring would be minimal. An additional complication arises from the fact that sometimes - not infrequently - doctors who are not on the specialist register are appointed to act as consultants and then receive a contract of indefinite duration and are thereby incorporated into the system for good. The problem about all this is it does not prioritise excellence or quality. It actually may prevent a hospital developing. There are situations that might arise where there may be a number of consultants in a smaller, more peripheral hospital who are not on the specialist register. Then that hospital becomes uniquely unattractive for a well trained, broadly experienced consultant to come back and work in. This practice might stymie the development of some of the smaller feeder or peripheral hospitals.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	I might refer to a recent High Court case which involved the Medical Council and a medical practitioner who was not on the specialist register where there was a risk involved.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	117	Of course there is. The whole point of having professional standards is that there is a set standard of quality that people have to achieve so that they are allowed to look after patients. If one abrogates and discards those standards, then one is discarding the whole notion that one would prioritise or develop a culture of quality and excellence.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	I thank the Deputy. Risk can be defined as the potential for an adverse outcome. Is there a potential for an adverse outcome arising from a situation with regard to the challenge in recruitment and retention at consultant level and unfilled posts and posts filled by people who are not on the specialist register? Yes, there is significant clinical risk created.

I will seek an opportunity to reciprocate his generosity. I have one question for the Medical Council in respect of CervicalCheck and the duty of candour and duty of disclosure. As I said earlier, in the Dáil yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that these "are not optional". He was talking about the duty of a doctor to tell a patient about the information he or she possesses. The Taoiseach said these "are not optional and doctors may be struck off for not following them". That is a statement that I imagine would worry many doctors throughout the country. Do the representatives from the Medical Council agree with the Taoiseach's assessment that non-disclosure in cases similar to that with which we are dealing in the context of CervicalCheck could lead to clinicians being struck off?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	134	If I can deal with that, we are the regulator in this issue and individual doctors could be coming before us. It is extremely important that we do not seem to be prejudging any particular case. Every case must be based on the facts as presented. However, our ethical guide and our standards on disclosure are very strong. The background to the ethical guide is that the patient is not a passive recipient of healthcare but is, in fact, a full partner. There should be active participation and collaboration between the healthcare provider and the patient. There is a very strong standard in the ethical guide, which was updated two years ago, and disclosure is obviously a very important prerequisite. That does not prejudge any individual case but we certainly agree there is a very strong position on disclosure.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	138	The State Claims Agency may have that data.

There must be a difference in the number of cases of actions taken by patients against one or the other. It must be noticeable. If there is no difference, why is that so? There is another question that was not answered relating to the number of graduates who cannot get on training schemes. I deliberately asked about it at a very early stage and although we have gone around the houses since, we did not get the answer to that question. I need the answer to those two questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	140	I am afraid I did not come prepared for that question so I do not have an answer to it. There has been an increase in the number of training programme schemes in recent years. There has been an almost 50% increase in the number of intern posts in Ireland, reflecting the dramatic increase in the number of doctors being produced in Ireland since graduate entry training began, essentially. There has been a smaller increase in the number of people entering the junior or basic specialist training programmes and there also has been a significant increase in the people entering a more specialised training programme. I could not give an exact answer in that regard.

However, we cannot get graduates on to training schemes and we do not know why. There is a greater urgency now than there was before.

Currently, because of legislation, non-EU graduates from certain countries cannot get on to Irish training schemes. The legislation has been drafted and there are discussions between the Department of Health and the Medical Council to overcome that. Unfortunately, the legislation has not yet passed the Houses of the Oireachtas or been enacted. If that was to occur, it would allow the overseas graduates working in this country into formal training schemes. It would be good for them and the public.

If a person is working above his or her scope of practice without documentation - in other words if a person is not on the specialist register and is working in a position with consultant status - how does medical indemnity cover that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	150	It is a fairly technical matter and I would not like to give any inaccuracies. I am happy to clarify that and furnish the committee with a detailed response later today.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	It is a matter for the State Claims Agency and the indemnity bodies.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	153	Aside from the responsibility of the State Claims Agency, my understanding is that one of the main mutual indemnifiers in providing cover in Ireland would not see it as appropriate for somebody to practice outside the specialty for which he or she is registered. In other words, a person practices only as a specialist only if in the specialty. It is a matter that has raised some concerns with some members and it is the response we have received from one of the main indemnifiers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	154	I will respond to one of the points made by Deputy Durkan. It is a significant point and is part of the reason we are here today. He referenced the public service contract and the drastic and severe cuts to those. The financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation was superimposed on a contract that had never been honoured. Superimposed on that again was a 30% pay cut on all future consultants. Despite our best efforts to have that 30% cut reversed, it has not happened to the extent that it should have. Undoubtedly, that has had a massive effect on morale and on our ability to recruit and retain. I teach specialist registrars on leadership. Around the time of the 30% cut being announced, I asked what their response would be to it at that stage in their careers. In unison, they said they would leave the profession, and that has come to pass. We have an opportunity to get this right and address the matter. We need to treat people doing the same job with the same qualifications to do that job, and working every bit as onerously as their existing colleagues, the same way. We also need to honour contracts if we want people to feel valued and want to work in the system.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	I do not know if it is appropriate but Deputy Donnelly raised the matter of junior doctors from overseas not sitting examinations. Is it okay for me to clarify that for the record? All doctors from overseas coming into Ireland either sit an examination set by the Medical Council before they register in the country or they have other reasons - including the sitting of other examinations and experience - that would allow them not to sit the examination we set. Those people have sat other examinations. No graduate from overseas goes on the Irish register without an assessment of their clinical skills.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	156	Deputy Durkan asked if we saw an increase in turnover levels. The turnover rate in 2017 for medical staff was 7.8%, which is keeping with international comparisons. In February 2017, we had 397 additional medical staff on the workforce, including 98 consultants and 288 non-consultant hospital doctors. Notwithstanding that, we have very significant recruitment and retention challenges in a number of the specialties, and that has been picked up in the course of the discussion. The figures are moving in the right direction, however.
#KateOConnell	unknown-#KateOConnell-party	unknown-#KateOConnell-dob	unknown-#KateOConnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	157	I thank the witnesses for coming into us this morning. I am sorry I was late and if I am repeating questions that have been asked, I apologise in advance. Following Deputy Durkan's questions, somebody made a comment - I think it was Dr. Breslin - that there was a marginal increase in complaints regarding people on the non-specialist register. Are there data to show how this has resulted in disciplinary action? There could be many complaints about somebody but they may not be held up. The key data we need to know are whether, with this marginal increase, these people are more or less likely than the regular guy to have disciplinary action taken against them. The Chairman recently mentioned standards. Can Ms Mannion tell us today that the public can be assured that these doctors are competent to perform their roles? It is a fairly simple question for the head of human resources. Who is liable if somebody on this register makes a catastrophic error? Would it be the hospital manager or the Health Service Executive? There has been reference to indemnity insurance. If the indemnity insurance is not covering it and these people are employed by the State under this set-up, is it the responsibility of the State Claims Agency?Who is paying? Are these people value for money, do they do the same job as hospital consultants? Do they do the same rate of on-call and is their net income in the year the same or higher? Is it cheaper to employ someone who is not up to the same standard? My understanding from anecdotal evidence is that these people are not performing the same on-call duties as regular hospital consultants. On-call is included in regular non-locum consultant contracts. In the current contract are they paid an hourly rate and are we getting the same bang for our buck as for a regular consultant? I am very concerned that these individuals seem to be channelled into small peripheral hospitals. When the hospital constantly employs locums and there is nobody in situ taking responsibility it seems very obvious, without doing any study, that there will be a drop in standards in that hospital and that will have a snowball effect. When there is a drop in standards it is not an attractive place to work. No Irish qualified hospital consultant wants to be responsible legally or ethically for people who are not up to scratch working under them. The answer probably will be that this is a false economy. Somebody spoke about recruitment and retention, Mr. Gilligan said that when consultant salaries were cut by 20% or 30% consultants were leaving the country. Logically, if the locum costs 30% more we have made a bit of a bags of things because it is costing more to keep a lower standard of individual in employment. Could somebody elaborate on the comment about locally appointed versus centrally appointed? My understanding was that HSE recruitment was central and if this is a local issue are the same governance issues in place? If the HSE has bypassed the proper methods of centralised recruitment to do it locally what is the damage to the system? The witnesses spoke about legislation drafted to overcome the barriers that prevent people getting on the consultant register. Does anybody on the panel have any issues with this legislation? Are there any concerns that this proposed legislation will in any way diminish the standards of Irish hospital consultants? Are we doing something that will lead to inferior quality? Is there, or has there been, any training programme put in place to get these people up to scratch such that a person doing the job competently wants to be a consultant but there is a technical barrier? Is there a programme to bring these people to consultant level with perhaps a pay cut in the intervening period? It seems logical that if the parameters of different countries are not aligned we would have some sort of get up to scratch course that would be approved and competency levels would have to be reached and assessed. Of those in locum positions how many have signed temporary contracts and how many are Irish graduates?
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	158	Many of the 127 not on the specialist register are in the small hospitals such as Cavan, Letterkenny, Portlaoise and Tullamore. Would it be true to say that the risk will always be higher in a small hospital because in a big hospital a doctor might be on a one in six or seven rota, working every day, one night in seven and one weekend in seven, whereas in the small hospitals they are likely to be on a one in two or three rota and will be under more severe pressure. Is that taken into account when talking about a higher risk?
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	159	Paragraph 4.1 of the HSE statement advises that "clinical directors have put in place monitoring arrangements appropriate to the circumstances of the practice of post-2008 consultants not in the relevant specialist division". How are the monitoring arrangements in place for reading radiology results? Does one person read the information and another read the same film? It strikes me as odd because the qualified person should be reading it in the first place. That seems like double jobbing. Can Ms Mannion explain how that works? Can the HSE tell us how many of those being paid as consultants but who are not on the specialist register will in the coming four years accrue an entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration? They start to accrue that entitlement from day one. I have represented many beneficiaries of that entitlement but is it flagged up on day one that the person is accruing that entitlement under law? Their entitlement under the law cannot be prevented and neither can they be taken out of the job to frustrate that entitlement.We know that but what steps are taken to ensure this happens? It strikes me this is an issue that will keep arising for all the reasons we have rehearsed. At the day one stage in the job, does a flag go up? The witnesses might talk me through exactly what is the process between that day and getting to year four, with the monitoring and everything that has to go into place. There was an article in the media recently stating that doctors who qualified in Sudan, Malaysia and Pakistan no longer have to sit clinical exams. Perhaps the witnesses could advise us on that. If it has been covered already, I am happy to go back over the record as I do not want to delay people unnecessarily.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	160	There is a problem in that if a doctor is appointed as a consultant, one is appointing an independent medical practitioner and there is no possibility of mentoring an independent medical practitioner. If I ask a consultant colleague for his opinion, I expect an opinion from him that is valid, appropriate and discerning, not an opinion from somebody else who is mentoring him. The whole point of appointing a consultant is to appoint a substantial person who can practise independently. The whole notion of bringing them up to scratch is really a nonsense because they are either an independent medical practitioner or they are not. If they are not up to scratch, they should not be doing the job. This is a confusion of risk and quality. In any other industry, like the aeroplane or transport industries, the industry does not act to mitigate risk, it acts to improve quality. It does not wait until the train or the aeroplane crashes and a person ends up in the courts or in front of the Medical Council; it ensures that the pilots are appropriately trained, the aeroplanes are appropriately maintained and good quality processes are in place. A basic quality process is to ensure that the staff who are supposed to practise independently are appropriately trained and qualified. It should never come to the fact that someone detects there is a problem only when a doctor ends up in front of the Medical Council or the High Court for malpractice. There should be quality programmes, and a basic part of a quality programme is to stick with basic professional standards and to ensure that all consultant staff who can practise independently are up to scratch and appropriately qualified. This is just the most basic standard that we would use to base any quality programme on. The whole notion that one would wait until somebody had caused a problem with the Medical Council and then flag up a risk is a problem. It is not prioritising quality of care, excellence of standards and an aspiration for either academic or clinical excellence. I believe the dialogue is misguided.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	161	Deputy O'Connell made reference to false economy. We would be very much of the view this is a false economy and it is something that could have been addressed and dealt with. The health service managers have been aware of it for a long time. The root cause, as I said, goes back to the State and the health service management being in breach of contract and discriminating against new entrant consultants. There is no getting away from that, and that is where the solution lies. Why is it a false economy? First, it is a false economy because we have a large number of posts which are vacant and which are depriving patients in our hospitals of timely care. Second, there is the question of quality care and risk. Third, there is the issue that we are actually paying temporary consultants, some 70-something of whom we now know are not on the specialist register, significantly more than we are paying the permanent contract holders, in fact, two to three times what we are paying new entrants and even longer-serving consultants. The agency bill-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	167	It is a false economy both in a financial sense and, as we have been discussing all morning, in the much wider patient care sense.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	169	Yes. It is one of the main issues causing difficulty for consultants, namely, that we cannot recruit and replace in a timely fashion. If we are filling posts now, we are, in effect, filling gaps with people who are not meeting the HSE standards or the Medical Council requirements, as we see them. Deputy Durkan raised questions about the recruitment crisis. While there were always challenges in recruiting in previous decades, in the last decade the scale of the challenge has become far more prolonged and deep to the extent that a quarter of the posts advertised the year before last had no applicants and possibly another quarter had one applicant, so, in effect, for half of the advertised posts, there was no competition. On balance, we would be talking about the rest of the posts having, say, two applicants and let us not forget there could be five or six consultant anaesthetist posts advertised at any one time so, in fact, we could be seeing similar people applying for similar posts. The scale of competition is much reduced compared with the position prior to 2008. This comes back to the absolute breach of trust and the failure to honour basic contract terms, which is very unfortunate. Another development we note is the increase in the number of consultants resigning from their posts to practise in private hospitals or to practise abroad, which is a new and increasing phenomenon. Again, I think this goes back to the breach of trust and also the lack of resources to provide timely care to patients. The third development we note in recent times is that more and more consultants are considering working part-time because of the stress and lack of resources, and, no doubt, also because of the breach of contract. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing problem that is beginning to mushroom out into the system. I do not have the luxury of seeing the most recent data circulated by the HSE but we were provided with data on where these posts were back in October. All I would say is that this is becoming more and more extensive and, at that time, it was affecting posts in 15 specialties throughout 15 acute hospitals and ten mental health services. In fact, the list I have seen suggests it is also impacting tertiary hospitals and cancer centres. While I am not sure what is in the current data, it is becoming quite extensive, which is a concern on several fronts.

Is there anticipatory advertising of posts when consultants are coming up to retirement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	171	No.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	I would like to comment on that. I have just taken up post as director of National Doctors Training and Planning, NDTP, and one of the things I am focusing on is having an efficient, timely process that anticipates people retiring and considers proleptic appointments. We know many people retire when they are 65 and some retire before that. We should question people, when they are considering retiring, not in order to push them out but just to get a sense of what needs to be done to minimise the gaps. The point Mr. Varley made is a fair one. We want to minimise the gaps and have an efficient and effective recruitment process. That is only part of what we are trying to do. The problems with recruitment are not single-factorial but multifactorial and that is clear from the discussions we have had here this morning. I would see it as my responsibility to make sure we improve all of those processes as best we can.There was a question from Deputy O'Connell on value for money I would like to address directly. The best way to do things is to do things the correct way for the correct reason. That is what we should be aspiring to do. We should not have protracted periods with doctors working as locums at consultant level. We should aim to minimise that. One of the targets I am going to set is to reduce our dependence on locums right through the system. I would also like to answer another of the Deputy's questions on locally appointed and centrally appointed staff. Centrally appointing staff to a substantive post includes going through a process called CAAC, the consultant appointment approval committee; and the approval of a consultant through a competition either at hospital level or through the PAS, the Public Appointments Service. For many locum posts, this process does not operate; there is a short-term gap, somebody retires or is ill or there is an extra post and that post is then filled locally rather than centrally. That is the difference between locally and centrally appointed or centrally approved.

The witness need not have explained that. It seems a bit strange, in a population the size of the city of Manchester, that one would have CAAC and two separated streams of recruitment for the same job. We are the size of the United States of America. The witness spoke about what he is going to set, which is aspirational. We have all had enough of aspirational plans. This is about real patients who have an expectation of seeing a consultant and every person waits for the consultant's opinion when they have something seriously wrong with them. When the consultant who is presented is not up to scratch, it really diminishes confidence in a system. The witness mentioned multi-factorial. It is absolutely shocking and no surprise if a person is reaching 65 years of age that they are going to retire. It is only a surprise if they are 45. Does this same ad hoc - and I realise that the witness is only taking up this post - approach apply when it comes to maternity leave, for instance? It is generally never a surprise that a person reaches eight months in a pregnancy and they will be off work - I understand in the health service it is for the six months plus the three months plus some holidays, so usually in the region of a year. Is the same approach taken for maternity as is taken for retirement or whatever other instances?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	178	We should anticipate people retiring, facilitate their early retirement if they so wish, and anticipate and set up that process of recruitment, which does take a time to do. There is a process that has to be gone through. Once a job is advertised and a competition held, the person who has succeeded is declared, and that part alone often takes six to 12 months, leaving aside the planning component.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	There is still a competition process that has be followed. I will give an undertaking that I will enhance that process of managing predictable and early retirements and having an accelerated process. The issue raised by the Deputy regarding maternity is an important issue and one of the things that we have not really done is catered, at all levels in the medical profession, for unscheduled or less scheduled absences from work. That is a project I have just started looking into.  The points the Deputy is making and the questions she is asking are fair and demand action.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	Thank you very much, Chair. I will start by taking Deputy O'Connell's questions in sequence, because a lot of them pick up the latter points. I have referenced this previously in the discussion this morning and on two previous occasions when I attended the committee here. None of these issues is new to me or surprise me regarding the requirement for planning for the workforce, for maternity leave, for scheduled and unscheduled absences; and governance regarding recruitment, adhering to our licence etc., all of which are set out in minute detail in this particular report which was chaired by Professor Tom Keane, and which we have referenced previously. I know we have a lot of reports and I am happy to share this report, but there is also a detailed implementation plan that accompanies this document that we have been working on very diligently since the publication of the report in February 2017. It will alleviate some of the concerns that Deputy O'Connell has raised about advanced planning, and some of Deputy O'Reilly's questions regarding how we monitor contracts of indefinite duration, whereby we have introduced a fully integrated, automated e-recruitment system for doctors. We are getting live feeds from the Medical Council in terms of data. That is the doctors integrated management e-eystem, DIME. I have previously offered Deputies a visual demonstration on this system if they would like that and I trust that might alleviate some of the concerns regarding these issues for the Deputy. Very quickly, if I could go down through the questions-----

A lot of these are legacy issues, and a lot of the time we would not start from where we are at which is neither here nor there. We have been working through, in a very fastidious way, the recommendations and the implementation plan and I am delighted to say that we are making progress. Thus the figures for February 2018 are that we have in excess of 300 additional medical staff on the payroll over what we had in 2017, almost 100 more consultants, and 260 non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and I can furnish all of that information.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	190	It is a factor. There is no quick-fix to some of the issues that have emerged over a number of years and that are a response to a number of unplanned instances. We are absolutely aware of the issues and are working through them. The addition of 98 consultants on our payroll in February 2018 is certainly a factor in respect of some of the improvements that were made. Would I say that I was entirely happy with all of that and that we have made all of the improvements we need to make? Absolutely not. Will we be certainly be making more improvements in the course of the year? Absolutely. Will we be in a better space next year? I believe we will.  As I have already stated to the committee, there are significant issues here. There is a global shortage in a lot of the medical personnel across all jurisdictions. It is not a unique issue to the Irish health service. Notwithstanding that, of course we can do better. Moving to the questions, if that is okay-----
#KateOConnell	unknown-#KateOConnell-party	unknown-#KateOConnell-dob	unknown-#KateOConnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	191	If we can leave the questions for the moment, I wish to deal with the reference of the witness to other countries. Do other countries have a plan in place? When we are making comparisons in international or global terms, do other countries plan for maternity leave, retirement and unplanned absences? One cannot plan for every eventuality, for someone who might be killed on the way to work for instance. It is fairly obvious if a cohort of women are working in a place, that a portion will be on maternity leave. If there is a portion of people reaching 60 years of age, it is obvious they will be moving on in time. When one is making comparisons with other countries, have they planned for these things, or are they operating in the same way as we are?
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	If one chooses to look back I have consistently raised this issue over the past four to five years. If one goes back 15 years ago, there was a different process for recruitment and there was forward planning and then that system was absorbed into the HSE. Now the whole system that existed seems to have disappeared. We are trying to recreate that system and I fully accept that movement is in the right direction. What I would like to know is why that system was abolished at the time and absorbed into the HSE and the process that was already in place ignored. This does not make sense.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	195	I will proceed down through Deputy O'Connell's questions fairly quickly and feel free to interrupt me if I am omitting anything. Are we more likely or less likely to have disciplinary action in relation to the 127 consultants that are not on the specialists register? Of the 52 pre-2008 and the 75 post-2008 there is no visible variation at a central level in relation to disciplinary sanctions in that cohort. The Deputy asked me whether the doctors are competent to perform the roles. I am advised that they are absolutely competent to perform the roles and there are-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	197	I was advised by the relevant clinical directors.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	199	Yes, the group that have oversight in respect of the 127 that are not on the specialist register. I am advised that they are absolutely competent. I clearly do not have performance management responsibility for clinical staff, but I have had no reports of incompetence in respect of those 127. On the question of who is liable if there is an adverse incident, it is the organisation that is liable.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	201	Absolutely, it is. In respect of value for money, VFM, and the issue of agency staff, I have never heard the HSE as an employer saying that agency staff provide a VFM solution to us. In fact, it is the contrary. Agency staff are a feature of the workplace and always will be for unplanned absences etc. We do not, however, want agency staff ingrained in the workplace or a permanent feature of the workforce. Over the last number of years we have had specific targets in respect of agency conversion. The Deputy will be familiar with this from across other grades in addition to the medical staff. It is not always easy and it is not always the choice of the individuals concerned. I can think of one or two hospitals - that I will not mention here - that have quite a preponderance of agency staff. Dedicated efforts and focused attempts were made to convert agency staff but we have been unsuccessful. Of the 127-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	206	Of the 127, 28 are currently employed through agency. On governance issues, they are all set out clearly in this report. I am happy to sit down with the Deputy, go through that and brief her on an individual basis if necessary. In respect of the requirement for a training programme for this cohort that are not on the specialist register, it was covered earlier in the briefing. We are case managing the 127 - who they are, where they are, what mentoring support is available, how we can communicate, how we can assist and how we can work in a collegiate way with other stakeholders such as the Medical Council etc. To the best of my knowledge, a specific training programme is not in existence because of the plethora of grades involved in the specialties. Again, my colleague, Professor Frank Murray, might want to speak to that. I think that covers all the questions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	212	It may be depending on the circumstances that arise. Then in respect of-----
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	213	It is not a fair comparison.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	215	It is an unfair comparison if we take it from a global point of view rather than comparing it to consultants who are on the specialist register in the smaller hospitals.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	216	When we are investigating a complaint we compare like with like. If someone is working in a small hospital, we look at what is expected for them working there versus someone working in a larger hospital. We do take that into consideration. Deputy O'Connell mentioned competence. We do have a competence scheme set up and 97% of doctors are registered and participating in continuous professional development, CPD. We did have to do a substantial amount of work to get all doctors signed up. Again, doctors not on the special register did require more work from us and the postgraduate training bodies to be involved. The location of issues that arise was mentioned. We do see some patterns in some of the hospitals that are more likely to have staff not on a specialist register. On the query in respect of changes to legislation on access to non-EU doctors for training posts, that should not and will not have any impact on the quality of care. It should enhance that. Deputy Louise O'Reilly has left but she did have a query on doctors from overseas not doing exams. I answered that with an earlier question. I will reiterate. Before overseas doctors are registered here, they either have to do an exam here or have an equivalent internationally recognised exam done in another country. No doctor gets on the register without some assessment of his or her clinical abilities. 
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	217	Could I ask Dr. Peadar Gilligan if there is a greater difficulty in recruiting consultants to model 2 hospitals rather than model 3 or model 4 hospitals? Is the policy that there are now joint appointments rather than full-time appointments to model 2 hospitals? Are people jointly appointed to model 3 or model 4 hospitals and then they also do a certain number of sessions in the model 2 hospitals? From my experience, model 2 hospitals struggle to recruit staff and to have a full complement of consultant staff.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	218	There is a challenge in recruitment and retention for the level 2 hospitals. We are, however, seeing challenges in recruitment across the system. It is not just at consultant level but also at non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, level. Many hospitals around the country are relying on locum agencies to provide them with staff to provide care to their patients on an ongoing basis. It is all reflective of what Deputy O'Connell referred to as "a bags of things" having been made of recruitment and retention. We clearly need to get this right. We need to make it attractive to provide specialist care in Irish hospitals throughout the country from level 1 all the way to level 4. The only way we are going to achieve that is by meaningfully addressing the contractual issues of consultants. I return to Deputy Durkan's point. We do have to realise that we are competing in an international market for specialists. It has to be attractive for people to work here. That certainly includes pay but it also includes the supports necessary to provide specialist care. It includes the supports that are necessary to continue because many of our specialists have a background in research and training and education. They require support in the delivery of that as well. Let us move from a bags of things to getting things right. That involves real engagement with the Government and the representative bodies to address the recruitment challenges that we have. 
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	219	I have a related question. We are one of the top four or five spenders on general health services. Will our guests give us an idea of where we are spending more since we have fewer consultants per thousand of the population than most of our competitors across Europe and the OECD countries. Can some light be shed on where we are spending our money to bring us up to that level? There must be some factor somewhere that is a dominant factor that will give us some insight into where we are missing out.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	220	I will comment on that. Healthcare spending in any country is directly related to how long people live. As a greater proportion of a population becomes elderly and infirm, more medical care is needed. People in Ireland live quite long lives. We live well into our 80s - to 81 or 82 years of age. That is a key driver of healthcare spending. Over the last 20 or 30 years we have been remarkably successful at prolonging people's lives by spending more money on healthcare. There is no sign that trend will change. As people in Ireland continue to live longer, more fruitful, happy lives, more money will need to be spent to keep them alive.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	221	The proportion of our population, however, in the younger age profile is significantly higher than many other comparable OECD countries. That is because of in-migration and the fact that in the last recession many young people who left the country came back quickly, or were stuck and could not go at all.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	222	There are good data in some of the OECD documents in Health at a Glance: Europe 2016 and Health at a Glance: Europe 2018.They go into it in quite a level of detail and do quite complex mathematical analysis of the link between how long people live and healthcare spending, and there is quite complex regression analysis and a curve. We fall bang in line with how much we should be spending for the life expectancy of our population. If we consider in particular the improvement in people's lifespan during the past 20 years, we can see the benefits of all the money we have spent on healthcare. 
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	223	I call Professor Murray.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	224	That is a very good question. One of the most stark and impressive figures in Irish healthcare is that since 2000 life expectancy in Ireland has increased from 76 to 81. That is very stark. That reflects three major factors. The first is the quantity and quality of healthcare and the way we spend our money on healthcare in Ireland, which, I believe, provides quite good value for money. When I compare what we do now for patients in terms of medications and technology with the provision 17 or 18 years ago, and my clinical colleagues will support this, everything has improved dramatically in Ireland. That is one place where our healthcare spend goes. The other two big factors involved in the reason life expectancy has increased by five years, which is very dramatic, are the reduced rate of tobacco consumption and a fall from the peak in 2001 in alcohol consumption, which, as I said here previously, is still a dreadful problem here in Ireland. If we are to continue to improve our life expectancy, improving on those three factors must come into play. However, it is worth celebrating the successes in healthcare in Ireland.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	226	That is a very good question. It is one I have posed to many economists. If we consider the facts, we have fewer specialists, general practitioners and hospital beds per capita of population than most other OECD countries. We have a difficulty with regard to the strategic spend on health. What I mean by that specifically is the Government allocation. When we talk of the per capita expenditure on heath, we are talking of the money allocated by Government, the out-of-pocket payments that patients make and the insurance. The only element of that over which we have real strategic control as a country is the Government spend. That component of the spend needs to increase in order that we can have the hospital beds, the specialists and general practitioners that our patients need.

For instance, if we compare the age profile of the population in Germany they are at a distinct disadvantage compared to this country. We have a huge advantage in terms of our young population, which most other European or OECD countries do not have. I cannot get to the bottom of this. I have asked this question several times and I afraid I will still be asking it for some time to come. I was a member of a health board previously and I cannot find out where we are spending the extra money to bring us up to that level among the OECD countries, given all that Dr. Gilligan has told us.

We are under some time pressure. I will call Mr. Varley, Senator Colm Burke can then make a brief comment if he wishes and then I will wind up this part of the meeting.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	229	Two elements are being commented on, first, the totality of the general expenditure on health and, second, the spend on acute hospitals with which we interface more and are more familiar. I understand the statistics we are talking about in terms of the general expenditure on health but if we consider the spend on acute hospitals, we have spent relatively less on two fronts. First, we have not invested adequately in capacity in terms of capital spend during the past decade or two. That obviously creates its own problem in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in delivering care. Second and very important, our assessment indicates that we are not spending as much as others in terms acute hospital spend on a per capita basis. We have to segment out the expenditure. Whatever expenditure is taking place, we are not seeing a sufficient amount of it at the front line, where patient numbers have increased because of an increase in population and demographic factors. There is a need to segment and analyse it in more detail. We are quite convinced that we are not providing adequately for acute hospital care. As was mentioned, we have the lowest number of beds, we have the highest occupancy level, 97% or 98%, and we have a medium or relatively short length of stay. We have a large number of people, unfortunately on waiting lists and trolleys, all clear indicators of a lack of capacity and front-line capability to deliver care.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	231	The figures Dr. Gilligan gave indicating we have the lowest ratio of doctors and consultants in the OECD and, on the other side, Professor Murray's point that people's life expectancy has improved, show the dedication and commitment of the medical profession in Ireland in being able to deliver the service despite all the pressures. We need to face up to the challenge and make sure we can recruit and retain the people we need. In particular, I refer to the figure I gave earlier, namely, that approximately 39% of our registered medical practitioners are non-Irish graduates. We rank the second highest in that respect in the OECD, with Israel ranking higher than us.

#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	233	In this second session, we are meeting with officials from the Department of Health to discuss the order passed by the Dáil on 24 April and by the Seanad on 25 April 2018 on the proposal that both Houses approve the following regulations in draft: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of Title: Dietician) Regulations 2018; and the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95(3)) (Variation of Title: Speech Therapist) Regulations 2018. On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Deirdre Walsh and Mr. Aidan Tumbleton of the Department of Health. I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise them that any opening statements they make may be published on the committee's website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now invite Ms Walsh to make her opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	234	I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us here to talk about the draft regulations to be made by the Minister for Health to protect the title of speech therapist as a variant of speech and language therapist and, dietician, spelled with the letter "c" as a variant of dietitian. As the Chairman said, I am Deirdre Walsh, principal officer in the professional regulation unit and I am joined by my colleague, Aidan Tumbleton, assistant principal. As the Chairman outlined the Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to approve the following two regulations in draft: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95 (3)) (Variation of title: Dietician) Regulations 2018; and the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95 (3)) (Variation of title: Speech Therapist) Regulations 2018. These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The Act provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act. Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles. The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act. Registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to "fitness to practice" rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors. The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system. These bodies are collectively known as CORU. The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse. The title of dietitian is currently specified under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Dietitians Registration Board. However, the US spelling of dietician with a "c" also appears to be in use in Ireland. CORU report that it has received a number of referrals concerning persons who are not registered with the Dietitians Registration Board using the title "dietician".Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that a prosecution initiated against an unregistered person using the variant spelling dietician would be unlikely to succeed unless the title is prescribed pursuant to section 95 (3) of the Act. The purpose of the first draft regulation is to protect the public by restricting the use of the variant title dietician to qualified professionals registered with the Dietitians Registration Board. 
The Dietitians Registration Board has written to the Department formally requesting that regulations be made to prescribe the title of dietician as a variant of the specified title of dietitian. The registration board has also furnished the opinion of legal counsel, who recommends the variant title be prescribed to remove ambiguity concerning its use. Representations have also been received from the Chairman of the Board of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute requesting that the variant title dietician is protected.  On the prescription of title of speech therapist as a variant title of speech and language therapist,
the title of speech and language therapist is currently protected under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board. Historically, professionals were referred to as speech therapists, and, although the profession has long since adopted the title of speech and language therapist, practitioners are often referred to by the outdated title. Legal advice has been obtained by Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, to the effect that a prosecution initiated against an unregistered person using the historic variation speech therapist would be unlikely to succeed unless the title is prescribed pursuant to section 95 (3) of the Act. The purpose of the second draft regulation is to protect the public by restricting the use of the variant title speech therapist to qualified professionals registered with the Speech and Language Therapist Registration Board.  The Speech and Language Therapist Registration Board has written to the Department requesting that regulations be made to prescribe the title of speech therapist as a variant of the specified title of speech and language therapist. The registration board has also furnished the opinion of legal counsel, who recommends the variant title be prescribed to remove ambiguity concerning its use.  The legal position is that
section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 Act provides that the Minister for Health, after consulting the registration board of a designated profession and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, may, by regulation prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title designated in the Act for the profession. Section 95(7) provides that:A regulation may be made under subsection (3) only if— (a) draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and (b) a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.
The regulations have been laid before both Houses. The Minister made a motion to move both regulations in the Dáil on 24 April 2018, and as the Chairman noted, in the Seanad on 25 April. Subject to the approval of the Houses, it is proposed these regulations will come into effect in the coming weeks. I am happy to take questions.

#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	236	To date, the word "professional" is restricted to practitioners such as nurses, doctors and midwives. Why is this the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	237	The titles are restricted for the protection of members of the public because when one registers, one must meet certain criteria, namely that one must have an approved qualification, be a fit and proper person, which is essentially a form of vetting, one must subject oneself to continuing professional development, CPD, and adhere to the professional code of conduct and ethics. One must have that package in order to be registered and by being found to meet that standard, one has an entitlement to use the title. If the title were not protected, someone like myself could come along and set myself up as a dietitian or a speech and language therapist, never having met any of those requirements. The idea is to protect the title. The way the 2005 Act is constructed, each register has protected title at the end of the two year transition period following the opening of the register. However, there is a fine line between protecting a title and over-protecting titles, therefore there is an option of protecting a variant, as we are doing here, when evidence has emerged that there are people who are seeking to practise who are not registered. Rather than protect a series of titles from the outset, one protects the main title, and, subject to evidence emerging of abuse of the system, one protects a variant but one is careful not to over-protect or to protect ten titles.

Obviously the removal of any ambiguity is important but how is it that the spelling variant of dietician is only coming to light now?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	239	It is an American variation, for the most part, and on some computer packages the title comes up spelled with a "c". The Act was written in 2005, so the title at the time would have been dietitian, as we are used to, and it is only with the passing of time that the use of the word spelled with a "c" has come on board in Ireland. If one were starting to write an Act now, one would probably use both titles, but back in 2005 the use of the word spelled with a "c" was not relevant.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	240	Is there a requirement for speech therapists and dietitians to be a member of a professional organisation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	241	No, prior to the introduction of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act, when there was not a State regulator for health and social care professionals, the standard was to be a member of a professional body. Sometimes, one would see the HSE, and the health boards prior to that, when stating their qualifications in requirement for recruitment, they would state that an applicant had to be a member of the professional body. That has been replaced by the State regulator. One is not obliged to be a member of a professional body, however, generally one would find that virtually all practitioners are for reasons of professionalism as distinct from a statutory regulation.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	242	Therefore, to engage in continuing professional development, this is run through the professional body.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	243	It is. The regulator will set a requirement for it and will set out a scheme as CORU does, then providers compete to provide that. Generally, it is the professional bodies which provide them but not exclusively, although they are the best placed.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	244	To be clear, the title for dietitian includes "dietician", spelled with a "c"?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	245	Yes, with a "c".

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	247	It is now "speech therapist". These titles are in addition to the already protected full titles.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	248	Are all the professionals encompassed within the regulations satisfied with the changes before us here?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	249	Yes. Each profession has a registration board and, as I outlined in my opening statement, those boards have been consulted. They represent the practitioners and the professions. In the case of dietitians, its professional body also wrote to the Minister seeking to have it protected. It is something that they have sought. If it is not protected, the ambiguity means that people other than their profession operate which is an issue for the public.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	250	Are there any disappointed people who might have wished to be associated and encompassed within the new regulations who are not covered?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	251	As CORU has brought to our attention, there are people who operate as dieticians, spelled with a "c", who would not meet CORU's standard. Once these titles are protected, they will no longer be able to call themselves a dietician, whether spelled with a "t" or a "c". They may continue to provide a service under a different title, so that one could call oneself a nutritionist or food adviser, for instance, but one cannot hold oneself out to be a "dietitian" or "dietician". If a member of the public seeks the services of a dietitian, one can look at CORU's website and check the register. If the person is not there, then they have not met the standard.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	257	Yes, they are probably both, but they simply do not meet the State's standard.

It is just a case that they do not meet the standard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	259	They do not meet the qualifications.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	261	Yes they do. Many people also practise as nutritionists who do not want to be called dietitians but it happened that a number of people were exploiting that loophole.

Obviously, there was correspondence with all the respondents in this case and we will not find that they have come back to us in a few weeks to say that they had been excluded or that they should have been included. That is not likely to happen.

We are meeting officials from the Department of Health and representatives from the HSE, the national cancer control programme and CervicalCheck in order to discuss the controversial issues surrounding the CervicalCheck programme. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, director of the National Patient Safety Office at the Department, and Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary of the Department's acute care division. From the HSE, I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme and screening service; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director of quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team. I thank everyone for attending. I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	269	I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it. I will start by acknowledging the important role that Vicky Phelan has played in highlighting a number of major weaknesses in how people have experienced our national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck. The Minister has publicly commented on his swift action so far to address these issues. He has also expressed his gratitude in public to Vicky Phelan, which I will do here again, for her courage in bringing forward these issues. Without her, we would not have the opportunity to learn the lessons that I am confident we will learn from this circumstance. Without attempting to set out a comprehensive roll call, she adds her name to a range of other patients to whom we are grateful who had to come forward in similar circumstances to raise issues of public concern, leading to improvements in the system. Not least of these are Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, Róisín and Mark Molly and Shauna Keyes, but there are many others. Our challenge will be to derive what value and learning we can from Vicky Phelan's experience, which she courageously brought forward, and use them to improve the system. Vicky Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014 and, sadly, was informed in 2017 that her cancer was incurable. In 2014, CervicalCheck's clinical audit of Ms Phelan's 2011 smear test result, which was reported at the time as normal, identified a query squamous cell carcinoma. However, Ms Phelan was not made aware of this finding until September 2017. This delay has raised serious concerns about the processes for providing information to patients and clinicians. Subsequent to the controversy that arose surrounding her case, the HSE initially advised that, between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases were notified to CervicalCheck. The majority were women who had already been referred for further investigation or for treatment by CervicalCheck. As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and a number were flagged for further cytology review. In 208 of these cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original results. Last Friday, 27 April, the HSE established a serious incident management team, SIMT, to oversee and direct the management of this incident. The SIMT has reported that approximately 162 of the 208 women involved have now been informed of the outcome of the audit process. Communication with these women is ongoing. We have further details, which we would be happy to share with members. I regret to say that 17 of the 208 patients are deceased. Like the Minister, we express our sympathies to the families of those patients. Arising from the work of the SIMT, and as outlined by the Minister last night on the floor of the Dáil, the number of cases of cervical cancer notified to CervicalCheck - 1,482 - does not represent all of the cases of cervical cancer occurring in Ireland since the establishment of the programme in September 2008. I regret to say that I do not at this point have the necessary information to confirm how many additional cases this might represent, but work has started on ascertaining what that number is. We will detail that work. The Minister has directed that immediate steps be taken so that information from the national cancer registry on any additional case of cervical cancer that occurred during that period is provided to the CervicalCheck programme. Any screening history that those additional cases may have - not all will necessarily have been screened - will be established. If any of these women was screened through the CervicalCheck programme, her case will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary. A helpline has been in operation at the national cancer screening service since Friday and clinical staff are following up with women on their specific clinical questions. Since 2008, some 3 million smears have been carried out by CervicalCheck. It is important to note that the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test, only a screening test, that is, a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, thereby identifying women who need to be referred for further investigation or follow-up. Smear tests can produce false positive and false negative results.Therefore, cervical cancer may well develop in the time interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme. The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which is known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results. Naturally, many women are now concerned about their own health following the publicity surrounding CervicalCheck. It is certainly our intention, if we may, to use the committee and its indulgence to reassure people about the performance of the programme in relation to those people. In order to provide assurance, CervicalCheck will make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test to have a consultation with her GP, in order to help her determine whether she wishes to have a further test without charge. These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week. We will hear further detail of this over the course of the afternoon. In addition, in February 2018, the Minister approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples, and I can confirm that this will be introduced later this year. A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment has found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process much more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests, and greatly elongating the interval between tests for individuals. I would now like to turn to the steps that are being taken to ensure the integrity of the CervicalCheck screening programme. Non-disclosure of information to affected patients has raised concerns for users within the health service. Patients have an absolute right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm. This is underpinned in the medical practitioner's code of conduct and the HSE open disclosure policy. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which includes provisions that support open disclosure, became law last year. These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for professionals to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate. By doing this, we have taken away any fears that doctors may have in being open and apologising to patients, specifically, fears of creating legal liabilities for themselves. There is no longer room for excuses. The patient has a right to know and should be told. The next step is to further strengthen and protect open and honest communications between patients and the health service by bringing forward proposals for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events. A stand-alone patient safety Bill goes to Government next week to expedite this. The Minister’s intention is to have an independent statutory investigation to examine the CervicalCheck screening programme. This investigation will have all the necessary powers to investigate the issues highlighted by Ms Phelan and will place particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients within the cervical screening programme. As part of this, a comprehensive examination of the cervical screening programme in Ireland against international best practice and standards will be undertaken. The investigation will also identify, within its terms of reference, any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes. In addition to this statutory investigation, we are now working on putting in place, as a matter of urgency, an international clinical expert process to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review. This panel will also produce an overall report to inform the statutory investigation and the work of the international peer review group. We are mindful of the need to provide support to these women and a liaison nurse specialist will co-ordinate the work of the expert group. We intend to include patient advocates as part of that process also.  Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 and 39 years. Every year in Ireland approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and just under 100 deaths occur from it. Cervical cells change slowly and take time to develop into cancer cells, making cervical cancer a preventable disease. Even with the inherent challenges in screening, having regular smear tests can pick up early cell changes or pre-cancerous growths and reduce the risk of cervical cancer. This is the scientific basis of screening. I must emphasise how important it is that women continue to have their smears and take this test, which can and will continue to save lives. It is our intention to take these necessary steps in order to ensure the integrity of the cervical screening programme while at the same time disseminating any learning to all cancer screening programmes. These programmes are an important component of the progress that we have made over the past ten years in cancer survivorship for people in this country. The Department is fully committed to the further development of our cancer services and to delivering the ambitious roadmap set out for these services as outlined in the national cancer strategy which was launched last year. We will be happy to take any questions from the committee members.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	270	I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the current issues surrounding the CervicalCheck Programme. I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, recently appointed as the HSE chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director for quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team, SIMT. I would like to begin by reiterating on behalf of the HSE my sincere apologies to all those women who have been affected and families involved in the CervicalCheck controversy, and others who although not directly involved have experienced any distress by what they have heard and read in recent days. I also wish to state that I did contact Ms Vicky Phelan to apologise to her for the delay in telling her that her test results had been a false negative and I want to sincerely make that apology to her and her family again here today. At the centre of this issue was our failure to communicate to the women that were the subject of the audit. Those women should have been informed and that is something that will happen from now on. It is essential that we re-establish confidence in our cervical screening programme, which is a critical public health initiative. CervicalCheck, the HSE’s national cervical screening programme, has provided a population-based cervical screening programme to the women of Ireland since 2008. It is important to be clear and to understand that cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but a means of preventing it. Cervical screening works by looking for changes in the cells of the cervix, the neck of the womb, using a smear test and cervical cytology. The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat and the treatment of these changes in the cells of the cervix means that the risk of developing cervical cancer is reduced. Screening is internationally accepted as a preventative health measure. While it is recognised that no screening test is 100% accurate, cervical screening is the most effective method of reducing a woman’s risk of developing cervical cancer. By achieving and maintaining the targeted coverage rate of 80% as it currently does, CervicalCheck has the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer significantly. Since 2008, women in Ireland have been attending in increasing numbers. CervicalCheck has achieved an 80% coverage rate among eligible women, a figure that is among the highest in EU countries. Latest figures from National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, show that the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has reduced by around 7% per annum since the period from 2010 to 2015. This means that fewer women will develop cervical cancer and there will be fewer deaths. To date, CervicalCheck has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1.1 million women. It has detected more than 50,000 high grade pre-cancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%. These were women without any symptoms who, without screening, would not have known they had pre-cancerous changes. Furthermore the programme has detected more than 35,000 cases of low-grade cell changes and more than 1,200 cancers. There are 15 clinics across the country which provide colposcopy services as part of the CervicalCheck programme. Continued successful collaboration between the programme and colposcopy clinics nationwide has led to sustained improvements to colposcopy services and eliminated waiting lists. The high standard of colposcopy has ensured that women who require a colposcopy are guaranteed timely access to a standardised level of quality-assured care. In 2009 CervicalCheck participated in an external international peer review of the CervicalCheck quality assurance, QA, standards. The international peer review panel consisted of those named on the printed version of the statement and I will not read the list out, subject to the agreement of the committee. They are, however, a credible international set of experts. It has been asserted that, in some way, the screening programme in this country is substandard to the US as it is asserted that the US screens every year. However, the HIQA report of October 2009 on the evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services presented the recommended screening interval internationally. In the case of the USA, recommended intervals are initially two smears, one year apart, then every three years. It is also important to note that much of the US system involves a self-select process, an opt-in which, in effect, is a voluntary presentation and not a calling or invitation system as in Ireland. It is not an organised programme in that sense. HIQA goes on to say in that 2009 report:A systematic review of the existing evidence base for the optimal age-range and screening interval for cervical screening was undertaken in order to determine if the current age-range (25-60 years) could be narrowed or the screening intervals increased. Based on the literature review, the current age range and screening interval adopted in the CervicalCheck programme in Ireland would appear to be consistent with the international evidence base.The HIQA report also noted that CervicalCheck administration has achieved the ISO 9001-2000 quality certification and maintains this standard through regular internal and external audit. A comprehensive smear taker training prospectus has also been developed and underpins a smear taking training programme developed and delivered in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP. There has been much commentary on the outsourced CervicalCheck laboratory services. In that regard, I would like to make the following comments. A procurement process for the provision of cytology laboratory services was undertaken in December 2007 with the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union  in line with public procurement regulations. The requirement of the NCSS was that each potential contractor would need to meet certain criteria, including that they must hold third party accreditation from a recognised accreditation body to international standard ISO 15189; have capacity to screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per year; have capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test; and hold independent quality accreditation of the service. On completion of the procurement process, a private sector provider of laboratory services, Quest Diagnostics Inc., was appointed for the provision of cytology laboratory services. In addition to the criteria above, each slide analysed by the laboratory is examined twice by two separate cytologists. CervicalCheck, in line with public procurement guidelines, re-tendered for laboratory services in 2009 and again in 2012. Following the 2009 procurement process, Medlab Pathology Limited was appointed along with the previous incumbent Quest Diagnostics Inc. In 2012, a further tendering process took place and the two laboratories mentioned above were appointed under a HSE framework agreement. This framework agreement is still active today and both Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology are still providing cytology and HPV laboratory services, under contract, on behalf of CervicalCheck. I now want to address the findings of the serious incident management team, SIMT, report. I have submitted the full report, which is also available at hse.ie, to the committee with the opening statement so I will highlight some of the key issues here. Over the past week there has been considerable public focus on, and concern about, the cervical screening service. Much of this concern stems from an audit of 1,482 cases of cervical cancer reported to the programme in the period between 2008 and 2018. The CervicalCheck clinical audit process examines the screening history of all notified cases of cervical cancer, with a date of diagnosis since the programme commenced in September 2008. The cases covered by the audit were those cases of cervical cancer notified to the programme and not the larger number of cases notified to the National Cancer Registry for the same period. The programme advised Department of Health officials on Friday evening that the figures were based on the cancer registry figures and it was on this basis that the Minister was briefed. It was subsequently determined by the SIMT that this was incorrect. The audit process is an opportunity to see if any aspect of a programme could be improved. The process can also provide more detailed information to women on the reasons their cancer was not prevented, as well as information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening. Of the 1,482 cases notified and logged to date, 442 cases, 29%, were flagged for review of one or more elements of the cervical screening pathway, which includes programme operation, screening, cytopathology and HPV testing, colposcopy or histopathology. Cases are reviewed by an internal review group, with the support of an independent pathologist. The most common review type, as expected in a cervical screening programme, is of cytology, that is, the smear test, due to its inherent limitations as a screening test. Cytology reviews are performed internally by the original reporting laboratory, and by independent laboratories if a further opinion is required. In February 2016, the programme commenced formally communicating review outcomes of historical notified cervical cancer cases where prior cytology had been reviewed to the consultant doctor looking after an individual woman diagnosed with cervical cancer. All historical reviews were communicated to treating doctors by October 2016 and the programme has been communicating current cases since that date. While the audit process established by CervicalCheck is seen as good practice and has the potential to make an important contribution to improving the quality of the programme, there was some evidence that the women whose cytology smear test had been reviewed as part of the audit process had not been informed either of the review or the outcome as it pertained to them. The women whose cases were reviewed already had a diagnosis of cancer so the outcome of the review of their cytology smear test would not have changed their diagnosis or treatment. They were entitled, however, to know that their case was reviewed and the outcome of that review. This was particularly important where the review team drew conclusions that were different from the original interpretation of the smear result. The SIMT established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with in relation to the review process. These were women where the CervicalCheck review team interpretation of their smear result was different from the original smear interpretation. Of these, 175 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result and, based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation, namely, a referral for biopsy or colposcopy. Of the total, 33 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result but, based on the opinion of the review team, they would not have recommended different clinical management other than an earlier repeat smear. On 30 April 2018, following the review of patient charts over the weekend, it was established that of the 208 women concerned, 46 women have already been communicated with and 162 women had not been told. Each hospital group was then required to ensure that each of the 162 women who had not been told of the review outcome would be phoned on Monday, 30 April and Tuesday, 1 May 2018. They would be offered an appointment to meet the appropriate senior clinician during the week ending Saturday, 5 May 2018. There were 17 women in this cohort who have died. It has been established that two of these women had the results of their review communicated to them before their death. It is acknowledged that, in addition to a diagnosis of cancer, finding out at this stage that they were the subject of a review will be distressing. The SIMT is confident that the clinicians meeting with these women or their next of kin will be very sensitive to the context of this information. While the women who were the primary focus and concern of the work of the SIMT had all received a diagnosis of cancer at the time of their review and the review would not have changed the outcome, they were all entitled to know the review had been conducted and its outcome as it related to them. This openness and transparency should lie at the heart of a caring and compassionate health care system. Many women may be worried because of the recent coverage, and there is useful information available on www.cervicalcheck.ie.
During the course of its work, it became evident to the SIMT that the number of cases audited by the screening programme varied from the number of cases of cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Registry over the same period. The SIMT immediately took action, escalating this matter to me. This, as the chief medical officer has already referenced, will result in the National Cancer Registry being mandated to share its data with the programme, the lists being reconciled, and an immediate audit of these remaining cases being undertaken. I would like to conclude by saying that I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is establishing a statutory investigation, which will be carried out by HIQA. I also welcome the appointment of an international clinical expert panel to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review. The HSE will fully co-operate with both processes to ensure we establish all of the facts surrounding what has occurred and, above all, so we can learn from what has happened and ensure it does not occur again. Given that I started my career in the public service in BreastCheck, the recent events are indeed a personal blow to me. I do not have many more weeks in my role. Indeed, I have only a few months because, as members know, I announced some time ago I would not be remaining beyond the term of my current contract, and consequently I intend to devote the greater part of those weeks to addressing these issues. In that regard, as I believe the Taoiseach confirmed earlier, I have appointed Mr. Damien McCallion, one of our senior national directors, currently responsible for emergency management, among other duties, to take charge of the national cancer screening service from tomorrow so all the issues that need to be worked through as we deal with this can be managed by him. He will report directly to me. I will be taking a very close personal interest in every aspect of this process. The SIMT will continue its work also. That concludes my opening statement. Together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.

As this may be a prolonged meeting, witnesses and members may take a break after two hours, if they wish. It is very important for the members and witnesses to note that the women at the centre of this controversy should remain our main focus. The setting up of an inquiry that will seek the truth on this issue should concern us. We should concentrate on that and not take political issues into account. The issues that arise this evening relate to trust. There has been a breakdown of trust. There has been a loss of trust in the CervicalCheck programme. There have been a breakdown in and failure of open disclosure. There has been a destruction of confidence in the CervicalCheck programme. That needs to be restored as quickly as possible. Full disclosure might not have affected treatment but it certainly would have altered women's ability to respond to the information. It might have afforded an opportunity to seek redress elsewhere, as Ms Vicky Phelan did. Therefore, non-disclosure had a significant effect. It raises issues regarding governance, accountability and the cultural change required in the HSE and the Department. I have three questions to start the meeting. The first is for Mr. John Gleeson. How could open disclosure not be part of the CervicalCheck programme? It seems quite difficult to understand. The cervical cancer registry and the CervicalCheck database did not match. How could that possibly be and how could there have been such a breakdown in communication? My third question is for Mr. O'Brien. Is it now possible to say we know all the information in regard to this issue? Have we identified each person who requires a smear case audit but who has not had one thus far? Has the total number of patients been identified? Perhaps these questions could be addressed first. Members will have ten minutes each for questions and answers. Witnesses are advised to keep their answers as concise as possible, just as I hope members will keep their questions as concise as possible, to allow every member to engage. Perhaps Mr. Gleeson might address the two questions addressed to him.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	272	On the Chairman's first question, on open disclosure, we started the process of cancer audit in 2010 with a view to ensuring quality assurance and continual improvement and through 2014 decided to review it and then commence, in line with the published HSE open disclosure policy of 2013, an evaluation of what that meant in screening terms, mostly in terms of defining serious incidents. It did not make specific reference to screening, which is different. One is dealing with people who do not have symptoms. It is not like people in hospitals; it is a different cohort of the population. Without trying to not do open disclosure, we went about trying to figure out how best to do it in respect of women we were concerned about because, after all, they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. We were looking at something before that point in time and how to communicate it but we did develop the process. It took a considerable amount of time, for which I apologise, but the intent was always to let the women know. We looked to practices in England and elsewhere to determine how that might best be done. It was always felt that the treating clinician of the woman at that time was the best channel through which to communicate with her. We would not know the context surrounding her current care and treatment at whatever stage she was at in her plan to address the diagnosis. We did develop and implement the open disclosure and communication policy in respect of treating clinicians. Admittedly there were certainly gaps, for which we apologise, in terms of making sure the information actually got to the women but our intention was always that information we had that related to a woman should be made accessible to her. Could the Chairman repeat the second question?
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	273	The second question was on the incompatibility of the National Cancer Registry and CervicalCheck.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	274	The National Cancer Registry is a different statutory body. It is not part of the HSE so there are data protection issues in terms of the exchange of data. When we ask women whether they would like to participate in the screening programme, they give consent to share their information with the National Cancer Registry. It does not operate the other way, however. If the National Cancer Registry is registering a cancer — in our case, cervical cancer — it does not go the other way. The National Cancer Registry was given access to the cervical screening register in order to be able to report, in an aggregate way, on the programme. It is a question of whether, over time, we can reduce the incidence and whether the detection of cancer will start to move to an earlier stage to give a better prognosis. The national screening service measure was under way to implement a data-sharing agreement in line with the forthcoming GDPR to make that communication two-way. We also felt in the early years, however, that most of the women would not have engaged in cervical screening. There are roughly 1.2 million women between 25 and 60, and about-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	275	Do not speculate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	276	I am sorry. The number is large, and we screen a large number of women per year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	277	To come to the wider question, on whether we know everything yet, the SIMT process has not reached its conclusion. This is a very important issue that the Chairman raises because there is concern or a feeling – I acknowledge where that feeling is coming from – about a drip-drip flow of information. Therefore, what we wanted to do as the SIMT progressed was bring as much information and clarity into the public domain as we could. That has had the effect that we had been sharing information before we had complete information.We gave a media briefing and provided the written briefing the members have on Monday based on the best information the serious incident management team had at that point. It was only after that that what we have told the committee today about the National Cancer Registry information not being the same cohort of women became clear. We have shared all the information we have. However, the data matching exercise has not been completed, and we do not yet know the total number of women who participated in CervicalCheck. That work is currently under way. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	278	The real priority for the serious incident management team, SIMT, when it was established at about half five on Friday evening was, having discovered there were a large number of women who had not been communicated with, to ensure that contact was made with them over the weekend. That involved finding out who had been told and who had not been told. We did not know, when were started on Friday evening, whether the majority had been told or not. We discovered that in the cohort of 208 women only 48 had been communicated with. The other 162 women had not. Regardless of the other issues that had to be dealt with, the priority for myself and senior colleagues who stayed in all over the weekend was to inform these women. Clinicians went into hospitals to pull files and identify the women. Our objective was that from Monday everybody on that list had to be contacted and offered an appointment so that they could be told that a review had taken place which they should have been told about, and to make sure they had information on the outcome of that review as it pertained to each individual. The first focus was on the women concerned, and as the process has progressed other issues have been identified which the SIMT will focus on. We did not want to be deflected from the core purpose in the first few days. We could have got caught up in the data issues and not done what we were set up to do in the first place.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	279	As the chief medical officer outlined, in relation to the additional cases which came to light yesterday and which the Minister reported to the Dáil, the screening history will be established, and if any of these women was screened through CervicalCheck their cases will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary. We cannot give a number for those cases; the work is ongoing.

I want to start with the number of women who are affected. Of the 208 women identified, how many have been told at this stage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	281	Someone was instructed to check with each of the hospitals, and as of just prior to this meeting we know that 172 women have now been contacted. In some cases - and I do not have the exact number - the woman has died, but their next of kin has been contacted. All of them have been offered an appointment this week. Some of the women have chosen not to take appointments this week because they have scheduled appointments and do not want to come in for a second time. The objective was that all of those women would be contacted and offered an appointment this week. Of the 36 who remain, at our press conference on Monday we were aware of 14 who were outside of the public hospital system. There has been difficulty in determining where they are and how contact can be made with them. Attempts have been made to try to contact everybody, but there have been some difficulties in reaching people. Some people are out of the country and some have just been difficult to contact. We have moved from a situation at the beginning of the week where only 46 women were contacted to the current position, with 172 women contacted.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	282	Mr. O'Brien has said that we do not know exactly how many people are involved in this new group. To give the public some sense of the scale we are talking about, a back of the envelope calculation would suggest 250 to 300 new cases a year for ten to ten and a half years would represent approximately 3,000 women. Just under 1,500 have already been identified to CervicalCheck. Are we talking about an additional 1,500 women? Are the witnesses in a position to broadly confirm that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	283	That is broadly the number that is being checked.

Is it a randomised group? Should we assume that approximately 200 women from this group may also have an existing diagnosis of cervical cancer but have not been told about a previous error or false negative?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	285	I am loath to speculate. We know that 100% of the women in the first group had interacted in one way or another with CervicalCheck. With the balance, we do not yet know what proportion of those women had participated in the screening programme.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	286	Many women in Ireland will be worried until we have answers to these questions. When is the HSE likely to be able to identify exactly how many women in this additional group are in the same situation as the 208 who are being contacted at the moment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	287	The first stage is reconciliation of the list from CervicalCheck with the list from the national registry. The next stage, in addition to identifying names, addresses and phone numbers, is identifying those patients who had cervical smears. We will then ensure that those patients are audited in a similar way to the original audit.

Are we talking about a matter of days or weeks? Will it take two or three months?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	289	I am not in a position to say. We will work as fast as we can, along with the National Cancer Registry, to identify who these women are. The first stage is to reconcile the two lists, and then we will move quickly to identify which of those patients partook in the CervicalCheck programme. We will then subject those patients to an audit.

We will have to make a decision, which we will do in consultation with the Department, as to whether we should inform women that the reviews are about to take place or carry out the reviews and then inform the women they have taken place.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	297	It is my opinion that the two groups - the 1,482 and the speculative 1,500 - are not similar. I believe there will be less than 208 in the second 1,500. I base that on the fact that the women in the second cohort are more likely to be older and not have gone through the screening programme and will have presented directly to their general practitioners or gynaecological services with bleeding.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	298	Dr. McKenna has provided a useful segue into the next question, which many people have been asking since the Minister made his statement last night. If there are approximately 3,000 women known to have been diagnosed with cervical cancer, why has the national screening service only been engaging in audits on less than 1,500 of those? Why were the other 1,500 not under the remit of CervicalCheck?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	299	The issue here is really the data source and how we ascertain the case number.The audit was performed and continues on the cases notified to the screening programme, generally from the colposcopy service directly, GPs or individuals registering their case of cancer diagnosis with the programme. This is with regard to the 25 to 60 year old age group. There may be people who presented from the 20% of the population who never engage with the screening programme. That is a big part of the gap between the number we are speaking about and the potential for other cases above and beyond the 1,482.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	301	It is worth saying the programme has a responsibility and duty of care to the patients on the programme, and it fulfils those obligations notwithstanding the comments made about disclosing information and review. To my mind, the best long-term outcome from what we are learning here is that we have an integrated data programme and, with respect to legislation and regulation, we have full access to all data on all cancer patients.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	302	With regard to the helpline, I want to read out a post that went up today on social media, but there are many throughout the country. The writer states that as a young woman she is second guessing the accuracy of her results as, she assumes, are most women at this point. Regarding the HSE number, which is the 1,800 number, she states the line is impossible to get through to and those lucky enough to make contact with somebody have had their details taken and been dismissed quickly only to be told they will get a callback. There is an awful lot of anger, but she states it is fair to say there is real fear, and it would appear the steps that have been put in place do not adequately service the demand and fear that is out there. I ask, as a matter of urgency, what is being done to make sure there is an adequate patient and public support response to this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	303	There has been a large volume of calls over the weekend and the serious incident management team became aware of it very quickly. In addition to the 15 trained nurses in place this morning, we have provided an additional 40 to 50 public health nurse staff, between doctors and nurses, who are being made available today to answer messages that have been left and those who have requested callbacks. They are being provided with brief training and information to provide to patients or concerned members of the public the most accurate information, and encourage them to continue to partake in the screening programme. These calls may take some time, perhaps 25 minutes apiece, so at the same time we need to get the message out there, and today on the websites of CervicalCheck and the HSE we have provided information for the public, including a video message by Dr. McKenna of the national women and infants health programme, who is with us today. In addition, today we have engaged with primary care and we have sent information on frequently asked questions and frequent scenarios to all general practitioners, circulated through the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners. In addition, we have printed and sent this to all smear takers in our service. This information explains the background to the service and provides a framework of advice to GPs to provide to any concerned patients.

They need to talk to somebody. Dr. Coffey has listed the various steps. The question I am asking is when can women in Ireland expect to pick up the phone, dial that number and talk to someone with whom they can have an initial conversation about the circumstances.,
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	305	We have provided additional staff today, not just to answer calls but to provide additional information. Might I suggest also it is equally if not more important that we get information out there for general practitioners in primary care and those engaged in the smear taking programme to allay any fears or anxieties people may have, rather than taking recourse to phoning the number.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	306	As a follow on from the last question, it might be advisable to get that information out to GPs as soon as possible because the women who cannot get through to the helpline are trying to get through to their GPs and they are being advised that the GPs have absolutely no knowledge of what they should be doing. That is just by way of comment. My first question is for Mr. O'Brien. He stated at the press conference that he found out about what he describes as a failure to communicate - and perhaps he might want to revisit that description of what we are discussing today - in the media. I am interested in trying to get to the bottom of this. A circular issued in 2016 is at the heart of the failure to communicate, as Mr. O'Brien describes it. It advised clinicians simply to add a copy of the audit to the file and use their clinical judgment on whether to tell a woman something about her own health and, in a case where the poor unfortunate patient had died, to stick a note on the file. When that circular was being drafted, and I understand it was signed by someone who was a member of the senior management team, senior clinicians and senior people in the HSE presumably were involved in drafting a circular of this nature. It stretches credibility a bit for me that these people, members of Mr. O'Brien's senior team, would not have communicated to him on an issue as serious as this. If we want to talk about open disclosure and being full and frank, I hope we can get away from what we have had in recent days, which is an endless round of people - mostly men as it goes and no disrespect intended to men - describing to women what it is like to have a smear test and how important it is. I do not need any of that advice. I have been having smear tests for 22 years, since I had my daughter. I understand how important it is. I also know it is not a diagnostic test and I understand it is a screening test. It would probably be helpful if we could dispense with having to repeat that. Will Mr. O'Brien give me some information as to who would have been involved in compiling that circular, because to me it seems that it came from a very senior level? It strikes me as odd that it did not come across Mr. O'Brien's desk, but he is telling us the first he knew about it was in the media. Perhaps he can talk to us about who was involved in compiling that circular.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	307	I will ask Mr. John Gleeson to tell us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	308	I was involved with the then clinical director of the screening programme in compiling it. On the particular point the Deputy mentioned, and the reference to whether a woman was deceased, we conducted this review long after the diagnosis of cancer and when we were notified the woman may have been deceased. Our understanding of data protection legislation is that it was her information and it was not to be told to anyone else. In other words, putting it on the file would make it legally accessible to anyone granted legal access to the file. This may have been a wrong interpretation. We did allow for clinical judgment as we did not feel we were in that position. We did not know what the particular circumstances of a woman were when a letter was written. We did, by phone, text and email, consult among various members of the team to try to get it right.

We would have shown it to the colposcopists and typically consultant gynaecologists received it and were asked what they thought of it in a draft and then we stated it was just to assist in the process. That is how it came about.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	314	They were not meetings. They were probably over the phone, working on the draft together, exchanging drafts over a month or two.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	316	I imagine so. It was by myself and the colleague.

Maybe they did not think it was serious. Surely they must have known that it was serious.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	318	I told the head of the screening service we were developing this to accompany the communications to doctors about review results related to women. It was reported directly up the line.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	319	But nobody thought it was important to bring it to the director general's attention. With regard to the cases that have been identified, the 208 and rising, how many of them are beyond the statistical rate? My understanding of Vicky Phelan's case, and I am not a doctor, is it was not within the normal range of statistical error and, in fact, when they went to look back it was not that she had had a missed diagnosis and that test had missed the early stages of cancer but, in fact, by the time she had her first test her cancer was far advanced.I ask Mr. Gleeson to correct me if I am wrong in that regard. Will he also advise me on the margin of error? Are the figures within the margin of error or outside it? If the latter is the case, are the figures at the higher end of normal?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	320	I do not have the clinical answer to that in terms of the interpretation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	321	I am not aware of the details of the unfortunate person at the centre of this case. However, if one had a clinical cancer, the chances of finding abnormal cells on the smear are less than if for a pre-cancer, the reason being that a clinical cancer may be ulcerated and one will have lots of blood cells, white cells. The smear programme is not designed to pick up cancers but to pick up pre-cancers. I am not in a position to draw any statistical significance from the lessons from one person.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	323	Part of the problem is we are looking at 208 case out of either 3 million or 3 million minus whatever we add to the 208 figure from the other 1,500 cases. Even if the figures are approximately the same, I think, although I am not absolutely accurate, that is probably within the acceptable range.

Members will be aware that previous clinical governance arrangements are no longer in place and that, therefore, the level of detail Dr. McKenna can give in respect of clinical questions is limited by the length of time he has been involved in the programme.

I return to how this matter came about and how it came into the public domain. The memorandum sent to the Minister states: "The Department is in consultation with the HSE in regard to their preparation of a press statement on the matter." Presumably, this was before the bombshell hit Mr. O'Brien. The HSE was clearly involved and I would like to know which personnel were involved. I watched what appeared to be old footage on an RTÉ news programme the other night - it appeared to be snowing - showing Mr. O'Brien and the HSE's head of communications, Dr. Paul Connors, leaving an RTÉ building. Mr. O'Brien rarely appears before a committee without his director of communications. Was Dr. Connors involved in drafting this press statement? If so, I am curious to find out why he did not inform Mr. O'Brien. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	334	The footage was from yesterday and showed cherry blossom, although I agree it looked like snow.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	336	From discussion with colleagues in the Department, the term "HSE" is used to refer to any part of the entire organisation. In this instance, the dialogue was with CervicalCheck and the national screening service. The screening service has two communications persons attached to it, as in people who do the advertising and so on, and my understanding is that is the level at which the dialogue took place.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	340	That is my understanding.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	341	It is worth noting that my role dates back a full eight weeks in terms of responsibility and direct involvement with the screening programme. I think the point the Deputy is getting at is that, as this case at hand came before the courts under the management of the State Claims Agency, we became aware of it without knowledge of what was going to happen next. We communicate internally to prepare for any potential outcome.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	342	I can confirm that the staff based in the national screening service are not part of the national press office. They do not report to Dr. Connors.

Dr. Coffey, in his memorandum to the Minister, stated he did not consider this to be a patient safety incident. I am sure he will understand the reason any woman reading the document would consider it to be very much a patient safety incident. At that stage, was Dr. Coffey aware that there was one case and possibly other legal cases in train? How many cases would there have to be to constitute a patient safety incident? Is it a matter of numbers or severity? The woman at the centre of this case is gravely and seriously ill. It struck me as odd that the case was not considered a patient safety incident. I wonder what would qualify as a patient safety incident.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	346	What those words were trying to express was the fact that this particular patient had a diagnosis and had previously had a screening history that we were aware of. The screening look-back, the retrospective nature, is what I was referring to. It does not mean this was not a broader issue or that the ongoing cancer audit was not important and it was not referring to any disclosure issues. Specifically on that point, the patient at that time and what we knew to be the case, I would have to say that much additional knowledge about the broader programme and the disclosure issues became evident subsequent to that communication.

There is nothing personal in this. We are trying to get accountability and find out what happened. The political sideshow needs to move on because the women in question and public confidence are the most important issues here. With all due respect to Dr. Coffey, from what I have heard at this meeting, his comments on the letter do not stand up because given what has happened, this clearly is a patient safety issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	351	The word used is "incident", not "issue".

If, during my years as a Minister, I had received that note and the events we are discussing had transpired subsequently, I would have felt misled. That is my honest opinion, not that of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, although I am not sure if his opinion differs much from mine. Regardless of whether we like it, in the opinion of the public this is either a massive cover-up - the witnesses can shake their heads - or one of the largest examples of collective incompetence in the history of Irish health care management. It is one or the other because the issues here are so significant and they are frightening many people across the country, as all of us accept. My first question is to the Department of Health. As of today, 2 May 2018, how many cases similar to Ms Vicky Phelan's have been taken against a diagnostic company and-or the HSE?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	353	We have been in contact with the State Claims Agency which has advised that the Vicky Phelan case is the first case that has been settled in relation to CervicalCheck.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	360	Legal proceedings have commenced in relation to six cases.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	361	I direct the same question to the HSE.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	362	Based on an inquiry we have made, we have received data from the State Claims Agency today on the clinical indemnity scheme which is operated by that agency. This does not break down in quite the same way as the Department asked the questions. We asked slightly different questions. Our question was on the number of active claims. Active claims could be ones in which proceedings have issued, inquiries have been received from solicitors or a level of inquiry exists which leads the agency to believe a matter should be treated as an active claim. It is a different question. The answer is "ten". We are also aware of media reports today on another case which is not included here and in which the State Claims Agency was not involved. Media reports relate to a prior case which it is reported was settled by one of the laboratories with a plaintiff.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	363	That was in 2013.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	364	I thought the report was 2014.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	365	I stand corrected.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	366	That is a newspaper report. We do not have active data.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	367	I want to clarify this for the public because this is all new information. I am aware of that case. The Department of Health says there are six cases in train, for want of a better phrase, of which it is aware from the State Claims Agency. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	368	That is right.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	369	The HSE says there are ten active claims.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	370	That aligns with what I said. Legal proceedings have commenced in six cases and solicitors' correspondence has been received in relation to a further four.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	371	Potentially, there will be ten active cases.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	372	These classifications are State Claims Agency classifications and do not necessarily align with the questions.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	373	I am trying to get at whether the witnesses are aligned as to the fact that there are six active and four potential cases.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	374	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	375	Yes. We are aligned on the figure of ten, which our data, or the State Claims Agency's information to us, describes as "active claims". However, they have a further one which they say is a potential claim.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	376	There are ten cases, six of which are active and four of which are potential, and there is one historic case on which we do not have the full details.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	377	No. There is one that is historic that is reported in the media, that did not involve the State Claims Agency and we do not have details. There are ten on this list that I can see in front of me, but I cannot share it with the committee because it is a State Claims Agency list. Ten cases are listed as active which means, in essence, that they are either in legal proceedings or they are in pre-legal proceedings and there is a further one which is described as "potential".
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	378	We have one historic, ten which are divided, six and four, respectively, as active and potentially active, and one other. That is the executive summary. On the historic case, is either the HSE or the Department of Health aware of the case? If so, are they aware that a non-disclosure agreement was signed in the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	379	Is the Deputy referring to the one reported in the media today?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	380	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	381	In the report in the media, there is that reference but we had no awareness of that case.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	382	At all. What about the Department of Health?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	383	No.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	384	We now have new information that there are ten to 11 other cases which are similar in some way to Vicky Phelan's. That is new information today. When did the Department become aware of these cases? Is it only in the past 24 hours?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	385	Yes.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	386	Why did the Department not ask before?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	387	There is no mechanism for reporting from the State Claims Agency.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	388	I am asking a question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	389	The agency has a delegated responsibility and it is not something we do as a matter of course.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	390	I presume that the question was asked following our meeting yesterday.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	391	Yes. The committee raised it with us and we spoke to the State Claims Agency.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	392	When did Mr. O'Brien become aware of these cases? Has he been continually aware of these issues?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	393	I became aware when this report was provided to me earlier today. I had requested that I would have access to this information prior to coming to the committee because I anticipated it was a likely question.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	394	Mr. O'Brien was not aware before today.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	395	I was not aware of these cases, no.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	396	Before today.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	397	No.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	398	It is extraordinary. While it is a subjective question, I found it amazing, albeit I believe him completely, that Mr. O'Brien found out about Vicky Phelan's case and the issues around it from the RTÉ website. The Minister for Health was aware of it before Mr. O'Brien. How did that make Mr. O'Brien feel?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	399	It made me feel significantly unhappy that I was unaware.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	400	Did Mr. O'Brien feel undermined?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	401	I do not feel undermined by the fact that the Department was made aware and the Minister was aware. I feel let down by the fact that I was not aware. There is very significant contact and communication at many different levels between the HSE and the Department. Different divisions and different parts of the HSE are in constant dialogue. I have no concern that the Department was aware. The concern is that I was not aware.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	402	In the last 24 hours, the Taoiseach has said that since this commenced in 2008, there have been double eyes on every smear. That gives a sense of comfort. Obviously, two sets of people are looking at it. Are we completely sure that has been the case since 2008?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	403	Yes, we are. For the first three years, there were two full separate reads. In other words, there was a full double reading.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	404	I cannot hear.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	405	I do not know what is wrong with the system today. The question relates to the reading in a laboratory of the slide on which the material from the cervical smear test has been applied. In other words, it is the examination of that through a microscope. In the first three years of the programme, there were two full and complete reads by two separate people. On the basis of an international evaluation panel recommendation, there are still two reviews, but the second is what is known as a "rapid review".
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	406	The reason I ask is that the 2009 quality assurance document from CervicalCheck sets out at paragraph 5.2.2.2 the conditions under which there is a second check. It is long and I will not read it out in full. However, I ask Mr. O'Brien to refer to it. It does not say they are all checked. I presume that changed subsequently. It lists the conditions and sampling under which they should be checked. We do not have time here, but I ask Mr. O'Brien to look at that and come back.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	407	I am familiar with the document because I have read it.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	408	I know.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	409	However, I am also aware that the contractual relationship with the laboratories goes beyond the minimum requirement of that set of recommendations.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	410	Will Mr. O'Brien cross reference and make sure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	411	I have done that before coming here today.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	413	I know that. This is my last question. The last question relates to the bombshell, as I described it in the Dáil yesterday, when the Minister came in. He was obviously not aware of the new information regarding the approximately 1,500 women who have not been audited.For me and the public, it is incomprehensible that we had a national cancer control programme with its layers of management - whom I presume are all very good people - we have a process to compile and maintain a registry of national cancer statistics, and we have CervicalCheck. Even though we had layers of people, management, processes and pathways not one person over the years noticed that only half of the tests were being audited. Collectively, for our health system, how does that make the witnesses feel? It is absolutely mind-boggling that only half of tests have been audited since 2008. Frankly, that is just not good enough and it is wrong. There was panic in the Dáil Chamber last night as a result. I do not think it is credible to claim that nobody in the whole place knew about this. Somebody must have known. I am shocked by the fact that the matter was found out and then told inside in Dáil Éireann.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	415	I would like somebody to answer my question.

I call Deputy O'Connell.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	417	Can I have an answer to my question? I asked a question and all I want is a quick answer.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	418	The ten minutes allocated to the Deputy have expired and I call Deputy O'Connell.

Mr. O'Brien, initially there was a two-year contract for the outsourcing of cervical smears, which took place under his watch in 2008. Was the two-year contract renewed or was it audited in order for the State to continue the contract? Mr. O'Brien was in charge at the time. In 2008, the decision was made by the then Minister to send the smears to America. Mr. O'Brien outlined the procurement procedure involved and stated that serious concerns were raised in various quarters. It would seem obvious to me that if domestic concerns had been expressed about the process then two years into it Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge, should have reviewed the outcomes. Perhaps I missed something in the opening statement. Under the heading, the procurement of cytology laboratory services, in his opening statement he referred to capacity of a laboratory and the turnaround time. I am reading his statement and can see mention of "international standards". His statement seemed to dwell on speed of turnaround rather than on quality. There is not much reference to quality. Perhaps he did not elaborate on quality in his opening statement.

Mr. O'Brien said at the end of his statement that this matter was a personal blow to him. I would like to make it very clear to you, Mr. O'Brien, that this is not about you. You are the last person that this is about. It is about the women of Ireland who have, yet again, been let down by the health service and by you because you are at the top and you are in charge. Can anyone tell me who owns the slides, the slides that have bits of my cervix on them in America? Who owns them? If we end the contract can we retrieve the slides for audit purposes? When a company pays €2.5 million without contesting it then it is obvious that the company has calculated the sum in advance and multiplied 2.5 million people by 208. Does Mr. O'Brien think that handing over €2.5 million to 208 people could indicate, without an inquiry, that the laboratory knew that it was not up to scratch?  Can Dr. Coffey explain his job to us now, if he does not mind?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	427	I am a radiation oncologist in St. Luke's oncology network. Since the end of 2014 I have been the director of the national cancer control programme. A couple of months ago I assumed responsibility, up to now, for the national screening service.

Is it to reduce cancers and improve outcomes?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	429	Absolutely, reduce incidence and improve outcomes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	431	If one looks at the cancer registry data for survival outcomes in this country one will see that outcomes have improved significantly over the past decade and beyond. Every time a five-year survival date is looked at one will see that we have done better than the previous five-year period in this country and the data support that claim.

Clearly, in this case, outcomes could have been better for women.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	433	The responsibility, which I take very seriously, is to improve services and their quality, improve the experience of patients and their families and to improve outcomes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	437	I believe that I have done it as best as possible within the realms of the science that was available to us. As Dr. Coffey has said, the indicators from an independent body - the cancer registry - show that the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen progressively.
#KateOConnell	unknown-#KateOConnell-party	unknown-#KateOConnell-dob	unknown-#KateOConnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	438	I know. I ask Mr. O'Brien to answer my questions, if he does not mind.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	439	Certainly, Deputy. In referring to international standards, I was referring to international quality standards, of course. I will come back to the bigger question. The only reason there was a reference to a ten-day turnaround, and why that was important, was because prior to that it had not been possible to indicate to women who availed of the pilot programme in the mid-west when, against a very long timeframe, they might expect to get their results. A big priority, in order to encourage uptake of a screening programme, is that at the point that a smear test is taken there is some certainty about when the result will be provided. That was the rationale behind that issue. Before the tendering process took place, guidelines for quality assurance on cervical screening with reference to the EU guidelines were developed in 2007 to 2008, and they were part and parcel of tendering process. There was also an external international peer review of those guidelines, which was referenced earlier.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	445	I never said that this matter was about me. I think it would be odd if I did not have a personal sense of how important this matter is, particularly given my past role in screening programmes. Of course, it is not about me. When one comes in here and makes an opening statement it is pretty much expected that one expresses one's own views on these matters.

I have to hand a couple of studies from recent years that suggest cervical screening is an effective method to reduce the incidence of such cancer but Mr. O'Brien has claimed that cervical screening is the most effective method. Is that a true statement?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	449	I did not say that in my statement. Clearly, it is also the case that the planned move to HPV testing will be an additional enhancement and will replace cytology, which has this known false negative-false positive rate. That is already planned. That is a matter of policy.

Is he confident that in his role then and now that the laboratory was up to scratch for the job that it was paid to do?

I believe that Ms Phelan's solicitor outlined on the media last night that it was not a case that a second set of eyes missed the abnormalities. My understanding from the media reports, and I am sure a solicitor would not say the incorrect thing on national media, was that the difference between the smear where her diagnosis was and the re-audited smear where it had been missed was very obvious.

I thank the witnesses for coming before us. First, I wish to praise Ms Vicky Phelan, the lady at the centre of this who brought this debacle to life. She is very courageous and brave and I send her the best wishes of all the members here today. As the only female Member of the Oireachtas from Cork, I have been inundated with calls from women all over Cork in the past few days. There has been a significant loss of confidence in the health system and in smear testing. There have been major blunders, one after the other. What steps will be taken to restore confidence in the system so that the women of Ireland can have confidence in it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	461	We have not been very good at getting the story out that the screening programme at the centre of this crisis is saving lives and if people stick to it, it will continue to save lives on an annual basis. We are behind the curve in getting that message out. To return to a point that Deputy O'Reilly raised about how good the programme is, let us say that we add another 100 to the 200 cases of false negatives we are taking, that would be 300 false negatives out of 3 million tests, that is one in 10,000. That is a very acceptable rate of false negative screening. The programme is effective. It would be terrible if people were scared from using it and scared of using other methods of having their cervix checked because only by enrolling in the programme can one continue to have the umbrella of being sent for a check and having the screening quality checked. I fully accept that we have not done well in defusing the confusion and getting our good story out.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	463	Would the chief medical officer comment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	464	It is important to say that we still have substantial confidence in the performance of the programme for the reasons that Dr. McKenna has outlined - sufficient to enable us to give full reassurance that the programme operates to the highest quality assurance standard still. I know that much has been said on the issue of public confidence. I am not suggesting in any sense that the Deputy is taking us back in comparison, but it is worth pointing out that before the programme was established in 2008 - and this is a ballpark figure - we were doing somewhere in the region of 300,000 smears a year. We were sending the smear tests to small laboratories, where we were getting poor quality assurance, QA and we had no QA to tell us what the performance was. Some of the women being screened were being screened far too frequently and others were not being screened at all. We were having no impact on mortality. I can remember testimony by clinicians, particularly from those who came back to work in this country around that time about the late stage of presentation of young women with young children with cervical cancer. That situation has not changed completely, but it is changing substantially. We have had since 2010 a substantial reduction in the mortality associated with the programme and a range of other factors that allow us to say that people are being identified.  We heard earlier about the 50,000 or so women who have been identified with early stage changes that could be dealt with definitively. If we continue with the performance parameters that we are seeing with our programme, we can be confident that we will continue to drive down that mortality. When we supplement that with what we are doing in terms of HPV screening, which will start later year, we can be confident in the screening performance of that. We have substantial reason to continue to express high confidence as leaders in the health care system. All of our health care practitioners should be in a position to continue on the basis of the data that we have available to us. I can make available to the committee an article that was published in the European Journal of Cancer Care about three years ago, based on a side by side comparison, questionnaire based. This analysis of cervical cancer screening programmes around Europe confirmed that we have one of the most organised, highest performing and most quality assured programmes anywhere in Europe. Many of the features we are talking about here today are exhibited by very few organised programmes. Many well-known countries, First World countries as it were, do not have that type of organised programmes. The basis for us to continue to reassure people that they can have confidence in the programme, confidence in the results of their tests on the basis of its performance remains. That has not been changed by any of the unfortunate experiences that some of the people of whom we have talked about have had.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	466	That is exactly what I am trying to address; the public can have that confidence in the performance of the programme and in the test results that they are getting.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	468	I wish to make one brief comment in response to the question on public confidence. It came through very clearly in conversations I had directly yesterday and today with the Irish Cancer Society, the Marie Keating Foundation and this morning with the Irish Patients' Association. What needs to happen in cancer services in general and in screening in today's context is bringing patients and patient groups into the programme to be part of the redesign and service development so that they know and understand the process from the inside, have all the information and contribute to it. I made that commitment yesterday and today.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	469	I thank Dr. Coffey.

We all know that the volume of calls to the helpline are significant. We are now being advised that calls are being prioritised. How can that be done? If the three lady members present were ringing the helpline at the same time, who decides which of us would be a priority and who decides on the criteria for priority? The advice from the HSE is that women who are worried about their screening results should go to their GP. I am aware that the GPs in west Cork are inundated already with large numbers in the waiting room. One must wait a few days, unless it is an emergency, to get an appointment to see the GP before this crisis happened at all. How can a GP, take on this workload on top of everything else?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	471	First, Dr. McKenna will respond and Mr. Patrick Lynch will follow.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	472	The message we are trying to get out is that for the majority of women who have negative smears there is no need for them to do anything other than to attend for their next scheduled programme appointment. If there are exceptional circumstances in one's personal case, then attend one's GP and in discussion with one's general practitioner, decide whether another smear test would be necessary or indeed advantageous. For the majority of people who have had negative reports, the message we would like to get out is to stick with the programme and attend for the next scheduled smear.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	473	In regard to the helpline, when the serious incident management team met over the weekend, the programme had set up the helpline. We were concerned by the volume of calls that were coming in. The helpline is the initial contact point, but the most important element of the service is the callback.It is experienced qualified people who are in a position to call back and talk to women about the questions that they have. There were very serious challenges. We understand that as of this afternoon, from the programme, there will now be 72 qualified people taking those calls. Most of them are clinical staff, doctors, nurses and people who have been trained. We have had very good support from others as well. There will also be people from the Irish Cancer Society and from the Marie Keating Foundation, who have agreed to support this.  There is a distinction to be made in respect of the issue of prioritisation. It is not prioritisation, it is that different types of questions have been raised. Some can be answered by a particular type of clinician, some may have to be answered by a doctor. In terms of streaming the calls and the questions, they will be streamed to particular members of the overall team.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	474	Would I get an answer if I rang and I had three or four questions that had to be streamed in different directions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	475	No, it will be a single person who will call people back. The HSE issued an apology on Saturday and on Monday morning, where there were technical difficulties with the volume of calls and there were definitely long waiting times for people, and people had to call multiple times. My understanding from assurances that have been given to the serious incident management team, SIMT, today is that has improved. We were then concerned by the length of time it was taking to return calls to women; one does not want to phone on a given day and feel that one has to wait a week for a call back. We have been given assurances this morning, as I have already mentioned, that all of those elements have been put in place. I would be surprised and disappointed if we find tomorrow, when we look at the statistics, that things have not improved significantly today. That is in addition to the wider communication through the clinical community, through GPs and the Irish Nurses and Widwives Organisation, who have also been very supportive and want to ensure that the confidence in this programme is not lost. There has been a general goodwill by everybody to get this fixed and make sure that we respond appropriately.

Can I also ask what resources will be put in place to ensure that all women who request another check will receive it without delay?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	477	There are two layers to that question. Some women may seek to have a repeat smear test, and the Minister has offered that opportunity. That will obviously depend on the availability of an appointment with a smear taker. Women will already know who their smear taker is and how to access a different one, from the CervicalCheck website. It may be that for those women who may wish to do that, that they might alternatively think of requesting that the original slide, which will still exist could be re-checked, rather than having to have a fresh smear test. In general, as Dr. McKenna has said, that is not what is being actively advised.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	479	We would advise that she discusses this with her GP, and although there was a delay, which led to expressions of concern from GPs - partly because of the complexity of what is being dealt with in the last two days - this morning, through the relevant bodies, appropriate guidance and information has now been distributed to every general practitioner.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	485	At this point in time the focus, as we have discussed, is on the first actions the SIMT has been taking forward. There is a discussion that will happen with the Department and clear guidance will be issued in relation to a process for this. The helpline is in operation. There have been a lot of calls and we have drafted in very significant additional resources, which Mr. Lynch has described. It is anticipated, however, that each callback is likely to generate a conversation that is likely to continue for up to half an hour. Even with that number of staff, with the number of calls, it is going to take a number of days for everyone to have that full detailed conversation. I am sorry that that is the case, but it is important that those conversations take place with the right, appropriately qualified personnel, as I know the committee will appreciate.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	487	As per the contract, the slides are effectively the property of the programme, not of the laboratory. The laboratory is required to keep them for a statutory period.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	493	Thank you very much to all of the witnesses for coming in here today. Can I go straight into the issue of open disclosure and the failure to provide that open disclosure? When the information became available that there were inconsistencies in the results, at what stage was there a decision taken not to share that information? Was legal advice sought by either the HSE or CervicalCheck, on that? The second question I have relates to when the first legal letter came in on this matter and who it came to. There would have been an exchange of legal correspondence before proceedings started. Who did it come in to and why did that not set off alarm bells at that stage about notifying the other people who were involved? Why has it been the case that we have had to wait for it to go all of the way to court before we have now decided to notify all of the other people involved? Can these matters be clarified? When did the letter come in? Why were alarm bells not set off immediately that this is an issue that was going to come to the fore at some stage, if not in this case, then in other cases? The other issue I want to move on to - and I am aware that Mr. O'Brien has spoken about reassuring people - is that the problem out there now is that people do not feel reassured. There is going to be huge increase in the number of people looking for repeat smears. What system has been set up to deal with the increased volume of repeat smears that are going to be taken and analysed? Has any process been looked at at this stage in relation to that area as regards ensuring that, if there is an increase in volume, that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner? Finally, my understanding is that there are 15 clinics. Some of those clinics had raised concerns with the people directly at the top of the organisation over the last number of years. Can it be clarified whether there were regular meetings with the principal people involved in these 15 clinics, or was it all by email and by telephone? I have received information to the effect that some people in the clinics based around the country had expressed concerns about issues as they arose but found that their concerns were not being taken on board. Was there a mechanism where regular meetings occurred on an overall basis between the 15 clinics and the people who were in charge of the entire programme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	494	First, I will deal with the questions in sequence, I will then hand over to Mr. Gleeson for certain points. The first point about disclosure which is critical and central here, a decision not to share is the reverse of my reading of the process in this situation. There was a clinical audit ongoing. There was a very protracted discussion both nationally and internationally about models of disclosure, concerning how and when to disclose. That is where the debate was; it was not designed not to disclose. What has evolved, apart from the reference earlier to the information being sent to the clinicians, was a patient information leaflet for patients telling them, where appropriate, that a review had taken place, and a very simple mechanism to trigger an appointment with a clinician to discuss all elements of the review.  The second point I will leave to Mr. Gleeson, regarding the current case and when correspondence started. The third point is that we anticipate an increased volume of smears, but it is very hard to quantify. Our actions this morning were to make sure there was the capacity, where clinically appropriate, to enable women to have smears without delay. That is open-ended. We do not know how long the interest and anxiety will last for, but we are prepared to keep the enhanced resourcing until everybody has had their questions answered to their satisfaction and, where appropriate, additional smears will be taken. That process will continue for as long as it takes. The final point was about correspondence and colposcopy clinics. I am afraid I will have to leave it to my colleague.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	495	First, I will corroborate what Dr. Coffey said that there was never a decision or a consideration not to disclose, it was a question of how to disclose. We will disclose, but it is a question of how best to do it. We communicated with the 15 colposcopy clinics which tend to be the centre for most of the diagnoses and invited their views. We have an annual colposcopy forum where we gather and to which we invite all of the doctors and nurses who work in colposcopy clinics to discuss issues. We brought in a consultant doctor from England who was involved in having to engage in open disclosure on cases to provide for some learning and a stimulated discussion on how best to do it. Individual consultant doctors did engage, more or less, with us in saying no, this way or that way. It is an evolving process and getting better. We met them a couple of times last year. We have communicated suggested changes to them, some by email and some by face-to-face meetings. It has been a process for over two and a half years and it is still evolving.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	496	In fairness, is two and a half years not a long period of time in which essential information was not being provided for patients?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	497	I am sorry, I should correct what I said. The process has been evolving for two and a half years. The decision to disclose was taken. It was to go back to every diagnosis made since 1 September 2008 when the CervicalCheck programme started. They commenced in February 2016. There was a backlog because we were going back to 2008, but we got all of them out by around September 2016 and as cases have been reviewed since. We have modified this approach slightly to make it better to make sure it gets to whom it is intended. The process is still evolving and obviously we are trying to get better at it.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	498	In the particular case there was a detailed exchange of correspondence between Mr. Hickey in Limerick and the head of CervicalCheck which, as I understand it, went on for over a period of 18 months. Surely to God, someone can come to a decision one way or the other, rather than having dragged on correspondence.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	499	Let me express a corporate view based on what we now know, particularly what we now know from the exercise in which the SIMT has engaged to establish how many patients actually were told. Clearly, it was a flawed process. Clearly, too much time was spent in trying to resolve disagreements. Had the matter been escalated, as it ought to have been much sooner, at a corporate level we would clearly have intervened to make sure the objective which was communication to patients would have happened. A key lesson is that there was probably too much time spent in trying to come up with a "perfect methodology". As time passed, that pursuit should have ended and the process of communication should have started.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	500	When the legal letter came in, surely it must have set off alarm bells at that stage. The question is to whom did the legal letter come? Was it to CervicalCheck or the HSE? Everyone is hiding behind the State Claims Agency, but am I correct in stating it initially came to the HSE or CervicalCheck?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	501	I cannot speak to this - maybe Mr. Gleeson can - but what typically happens is the individual service will receive correspondence, either from a patient or legal representation, seeking access to file-based information. In some cases, that provision is made and the thing does not proceed further. In some cases, it proceeds further. Then either the service or the official headquarters of the HSE receives correspondence. There is much such correspondence which, by statute, is passed to the State Claims Agency. In this particular case Mr. Gleeson may be able to tell us the sequence of events.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	502	I want to find out when the letter came in and who received it. Surely it must have set alarm bells ringing about the need for disclosure to everyone else also?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	503	Can Mr. Gleeson say when the letter was received?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	504	To my knowledge, the letter was received in late January or early February. The judge in the case has acknowledged that it was an incredibly short timeframe. A letter from a legal representative was received on my desk related to the service in which I was involved asking for the disclosure of all records related to a named woman, to which we responded.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	505	In January of what year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	506	January or at the end of February this year; I do not have the date here.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	507	Did it not set off alarm bells because we are now going through a legal process on the need to look at the process in place for disclosure. The person obviously had concerns that a disclosure had not been made. Surely when a letter like that comes in - it is like any organisation getting a legal letter - the immediate response is if that is what is happening in the particular case, maybe we should now look at the other cases also.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	508	To clarify, the allegation was that the disclosure had been delayed, not that it had not been made. In the records we provided in response to the request for all records was a copy of the disclosure from 2016 because it had not gone out. It was then when the woman was informed, but this did not trigger, "Oh, we have got to disclose" or in other cases which had already been done with. It was an access to records request.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	509	Surely where errors had been identified and there was a need to disclose information the letter received in January should have set off a process to make sure something was put in place at that stage, rather than having to deal with it now in the public domain.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	510	In addition to everything else at which we are looking, there is to be a case management review. It is clearly the case, given that this was never escalated to me prior to my hearing about it on the RTE app, that the significance of all of this was recognised and identified to a sufficient extent. The Senator is right to identify that there was an event which should have triggered an analysis, an assessment and possibly a series of actions. We do need, as part of the totality of what we are doing - this will not be for the SIMT - to look at how such initiations of proceedings are used to inform our understanding of risk and issues and the success or otherwise of the processes that have gone before. I am actually agreeing with the Senator's point.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	511	Thank you very much, Mr. O'Brien.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	512	To continue the theme of my colleague, what alert system is in place within the health service in the event that something occurs within the system which should set off alarm bells? Is there such a trigger mechanism and, if not, why not? What happened in the particular case we have discussed in the past couple of weeks? Was the emphasis on defending the case in court, or was it on reaching out to the victim, the patient, and alerting other patients to what might be happening? To what extent do the delegates believe public confidence in the system has been damaged? By the system I mean the health service.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	513	I will take two of the questions and ask Mr. Lynch to respond to the third. This case was not defended by the State. There was no defence. To use the technical term, the case was struck out and a settlement was reached with the laboratory, not the State. As I understand it, the efforts of the State Claims Agency were very much aimed at facilitating a settlement.Since the question has been asked, not by the Deputy but in the wider public debate, I can confirm that at no point did the State Claims Agency seek a confidentiality agreement on this matter. On its behalf, I want to put that into the public space because it is important.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	514	Could Mr. O'Brien repeat that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	515	At no point in time did the State Claims Agency seek a confidentiality agreement on this matter. It has been very clear that this was not something it was involved in. It is important as a matter of public confidence. Has public confidence been shaken? Yes, of course it has. That is the most tragic thing in this circumstance because, unless the CervicalCheck programme continues to receive the active participation and support of the 80% of those eligible who have supported it up to now, we will be in danger of seeing a reversal in the trend for cervical cancer. I have explained — some people have taken issue with my explanation — that what is at the heart of why we are here now is that a decision to carry out reviews or audits and then to communicate the results to the individuals concerned fell apart at the implementation stage. That is kind of what brings us to where we are now. As Dr. McKenna has outlined, even in extremis based on the estimates we have heard and even if all of the cases were missed opportunities for diagnosis, they fall, in total, within the parameters of a successful screening programme because screening programmes are not 100% effective. The benefit of this screening programme is that 50,000 women have had a diagnosis of high-grade cell changes resulting in early treatment, resulting in their being able to avoid developing cancer. Consequently, the numbers of cancers have fallen and the number of deaths has fallen. These are really important health benefits in respect of which we must collectively try to do our best not to lose because it would be to the detriment of everyone if the trend went backwards. In addition to putting matters to right for the women who were not given the information they should have been given, one of our greatest focuses and one that has been our immediate priority is restoring public confidence. Without it, we will pay a huge public health price. That is why I am focusing on this now to the extent that I am and why I have taken the steps with the movement of Mr. Damien McCallion to take personal charge of the national cancer screening service. I ask Mr. Patrick Lynch to speak about how alarm bells should be treated.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	516	A range of things happen anywhere in the health service on any given day. Therefore, when one asks about alerts, one should note there is a whole range of alerts and different levels of severity. Certainly, where patient safety is any way concerned, we have incident-reporting systems and risk-management systems, all of which should ensure the people who need to know do know. That is not just for information purposes because very often some action has to be taken. In the context of the serious incident management team, our objective, as I said at the beginning, related to the women concerned. We did not know last Friday about the 208 women and how many had been told and how many had not. At the end of the weekend exercise, we were surprised by the number who had not been told. That, for us, was very concerning in terms of openness to the women. We have not got to the why, who and what at this stage but I believe there was an important lesson to be learned. It might not have appeared on an incident system but there are opportunities for any part of our service now to know that there are certain things that have got to be escalated, not just to notify people but very often with a view to taking action, and something has got to change as a result. The work we have done in the past week will help in addressing this.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	518	When we examined this, we noted the primary issue was that these women, who already had a smear and went through the review process, were entitled to any new information we had about their original smear. They were entitled to know that information. These were women already diagnosed with cancer but they were entitled to know. In 175 cases, when the review team reviewed the smears its clinical interpretation was different and it would have recommended a different escalation of clinical management. Yes, they should have known. The process was in place to achieve this. It fell down somewhere.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	519	Why did it fall down? In the interim, has the HSE had an opportunity to test the system to find out where the weakness was given the potential threat to the health and, eventually, the lives of a quite substantial number of women throughout the country?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	520	The review itself was not a threat; it was the information contained in the review on what had happened previously that was important for the women to know. The focus for us this week has primarily been on making sure the women who had a review were made aware of the fact that a review was undertaken and the outcome in their cases. That is just a basic requirement in respect of the openness of the health system and the responsibility to the women of those of us working in it. The second priority was to a very large cohort of women and their families right across Ireland who were concerned about cervical screening and their own health. There will be time. All of these things will be looked at because we want to improve the system and ensure we learn from what happened so it will not happen again.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	521	Did anybody warn that this might happen given that tests are carried out every three years here and every year in the United States? Did anyone anticipate what could happen in a situation like that given the scientific knowledge available to the health services?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	522	It is absolutely inevitable that there will be women who will get a "no abnormality detected" smear test result and subsequently develop cervical cancer and in respect of whom, on the basis of a review of their slides, once it is known that they have had cervical cancer, a reviewer will suggest a different result ought to have been given. That is because this form of testing is internationally understood to be 70% accurate. It is a screening test and not a diagnostic test. It was always inevitable that the screening programme, as with all population screening programmes, would not provide a pathway to diagnosis for every woman who might have been able to benefit from it. At the outset, based on all the public health information available, and in any country that has decided to have a screening programme for any population-based cancer, the decision is made to have the screening programme based on the benefit it can deliver as opposed to the benefits it will not deliver. That benefit, as I characterised earlier, is a 7% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. The detection of high-grade cervical cell abnormalities among 50,000 patients, enabling them to have treatment, means they will not go on to develop cervical cancer. There have been 1,200 women diagnosed with cervical cancer through the programme, the result being that they could start their treatment pathway earlier than otherwise. The issue to which the Deputy is referring is the relationship or suggestion that the decision to provide the cervical cytology testing through laboratories outside Ireland is in some way connected with this. There was always going to be a certain number of cases like this, unfortunately. There was always going to be a need to review, and there was always going to be a need to communicate, but the performance of the laboratories is in line with international expectations and has not contributed to a situation where there are more such events than would be likely to occur in any event.

Are all the laboratories - those in the United States and those here - equally efficient in their ability to determine and alert to the existence of the disease? How does the HSE propose to set in place a procedure that will quickly alert both the system and patients as to what to be aware of? Who alerts whom from there on? How are the relevant sections of the HSE and the Department of Health alerted? Are they alerted at the same time? Is all the information collated and referred in such a way as to ensure that the necessary information is available to everyone within the system?
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	526	A brief answer, if possible.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	527	I will do my very best. All the individual laboratories are performing within acceptable norms. There is an upper and lower level in each case that is being achieved. As a marker of efficiency, which is what I think the Deputy means, they are all equally-----
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	528	Accuracy as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	529	Yes, in accuracy as well, particularly as the test is not 100% accurate. The laboratories are all operating within the norms one would expect, and this is monitored closely. Regarding the alert system, the first thing to note is that the CervicalCheck programme will be fully data-linked with the National Cancer Registry. The triggering of a review will be based either on a notification from the registry or, where that notification becomes known to the programme more quickly, as a result of presentation at one of the colposcopy clinics. Each individual review will be undertaken expeditiously and the information communicated at speed to the treating clinician. The treating clinician will be the one to convey that information to each individual patient. We will go through a specific learning exercise and a review of what happened in this particular case to ensure that we cover and block off the gaps. There will, of course, be continuous sharing of information at appropriate times with the Department of Health, just as there was in this instance but perhaps in a different way, more efficiently and more transparently. Of course, what we will not allow to happen again is the kind of confusion and communication that arose in respect of this cohort, the numbers of women who had assessments carried out versus the National Cancer Registry data, which I discussed in my opening statement.

I will now bring in some Deputies who are not members of the committee. The arrangement we had come to prior to the meeting was that non-members would have five minutes to ask questions. Deputy Coppinger is first, followed by Deputy Bríd Smith.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	533	The HSE opening statement reads, "The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results." Why would we use a system with low sensitivity in a country that has the highest cervical cancer rate of all EU member states? I wish to ask about the claim Mr. O'Brien has just made to the effect that 70% is the average accuracy of the test. That is not the figure that was cited on the Dáil record in 2008. What is a not insignificant number? I will group my questions, if the Chairman does not mind, because I have only half the time of the committee members. Why is the accuracy so low when, in 2008, Irish labs had a 95% accuracy rate, according to Senator James Reilly, who went on to become Minister for Health and who is a doctor. I assume he was not telling a lie. Why would we move to a system that, according to other experts at the time, had an 85% accuracy rate? I refer to the US system. I am not just blaming the witnesses. These were political decisions that were taken. The witnesses are managers. I put it to them that this was testing on the cheap. At the time, Mr. O'Brien, in an article in The Irish Times published on 9 May 2008, said he was satisfied Quest Diagnostics could provide the required quality of testing. However, the emphasis in his opening statement today seemed to be on getting 25,000 smear samples done a year with a high turnaround to get the results back in people's hands by a certain amount of time. This seems to sacrifice quality for quantity and a fast turnaround regardless of the results. I wish to take the following issue up with Mr. O'Brien. He has said, or has given the impression to another Deputy, that two people were looking at every slide in the American labs. Is he satisfied that this was the case? He will be well aware that Dr. Gibbons, who was high up in the HSE and the cervical programme, took issue at the time with this and said this would not be the case. Also, with the difference in the way they test - once every three years there with two pairs of eyes, whereas we tested once a year with one pair-----

Why has Ireland never reached the 1.8% average high-grade detection rate that other countries reached, particularly as this incidence of cancer here is higher than anywhere else in Europe? Will the witnesses explain the other screening programmes? MedLab Pathology claims, in its own propaganda and publicity material, that it has the contract for the bowel screening programme. Will Mr. O'Brien or anyone else from the HSE clarify if this is the case? Will the witnesses also clarify how outsourcing to a foreign company could be considered best practice when it is not then possible to have multidisciplinary team meetings? Finally, regarding the calls to the helpline, it was stated that 4,876 women are awaiting callbacks. Obviously, this could take a huge amount of time because they will require significant conversations. Is Mr. O'Brien saying that these women could also have had inaccurate results and that if they require callbacks, the scale of this could be much higher? Given what we have learned, will the HSE give a commitment not to outsource this testing ever again and to bring it back under public, nationalised control here in Ireland? In other words, to be carried out close by to the hospital where a woman would be receiving treatment?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	538	The quotation was from the chief medical officer's opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	539	It is not that we have a choice available to us of using a better test; that is the extent of the benefit, the limitations of that technology internationally. Nowhere else was able to get a better performance or a better or alternative type of test until a new technology called human papillomavirus, HPV, testing recently became available. Ireland will be one of the first countries in the world to introduce HPV testing as part of its cervical screening programme later this year.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	540	I was referring to the fact that over the ten years we never reached the 1.8% average rate that other countries did yet we have a higher instance of cervical cancer. If we are getting lower detection rates back but getting a higher number of actual diagnoses, did Dr. Holohan not flag a problem over the ten years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	541	I heard, I think, Dr. Gibbons inviting people to conclude that this was evidence of an inferior performance of our screening programme relative to other screening programmes. That is not a correct conclusion.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	543	We have hit all the quality assurance parameters for each of the stages of the programme. The quality assurance, QA, guidelines we have and the publication of QA audits in this regard demonstrate that. A side-by-side comparison makes that clear. We have had a substantial impact on mortality as a consequence in this country and we know we have had a significant impact on indicators such as the stage of presentation of cervical cancer. We are confident, therefore, that the QA data and the actual outcome experience of our population demonstrate that we have had significant public health value. The, in my view, erroneous assumption that was being made that in some way this was falling short by the order of a third in terms of the standard in comparison to other countries is simply not correct.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	544	That was only in one year. That was the first year. However, while it did go up in subsequent years and hovered around a rate of 1.4%, it never went up to a rate of 1.8%. That is a significant difference in average from other countries that do the test differently. I refer to our nearest neighbour, the National Health Service, NHS, for example.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	545	In relation to high grade, the 2015-16 CervicalCheck annual report listed all the different categories of high-grade detection. Added together, they come to 1.66%. That is perfectly within what one would expect. I wish to correct any belief the Deputy might have that the decision to outsource was cost driven. It was not. While every competitive tendering process must take account of cost in order not to be a hostage to overpricing, 80% of the criteria in the tendering process were quality orientated. The volume requirement of 25,000 was because, as in many things, there can be a correlation between volume and quality. We did not want to have very small providers doing things such as were happening in Ireland at the time. The Deputy used the interesting phrase "reading the slides close to the hospital". In some cases, that meant on the kitchen table at home. Ten years ago, Deputy Coppinger's constituents might have waited up to a year for their results. The ten-day turnaround is because that is what is required to be able to offer a credible cervical screening programme - or any screening programme. We can not say come have a test and wait forever for the result.

We are going to stay as long as we have to. I call Deputy Bríd Smith, who has five minutes for questions and answers.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	553	Mr. O'Brien was asked on the "Today with Sean O'Rourke" programme about the concerns raised in 2008 by Dr. David Gibbons and Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith. Dr. Gibbons and other scientists subsequently resigned because their concerns were ignored and dismissed. When that was put to Mr. O'Brien, he said that he had addressed those concerns in the final contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics. Will the witness describe how he addressed those concerns? What was written into the contract? If Mr. O'Brien was prepared to address those concerns, why was that not indicated to the scientists at the time, instead of forcing their resignation? He subsequently said he was happy with the standards applied by Quest Diagnostics. Mr. O'Brien must have been happy with the standards applied by CPL in Austin, Texas, as well, because he awarded it the contract. However, CPL is the company that was successfully sued by Ms Vicky Phelan. It settled with her for €2.5 million. Why would the company have settled with her if there was not a difficulty? I would like a brief answer.  I have read the press release from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening. It has called on the Minister for Health to publish the results of the 2014 audit. When I asked the Minister in the Dáil last night to do that, he said there were no results of the audit - there were just individual reports for individual women. I spoke to a friend of mine who is a scientist about this today. She said that would be extraordinary because every audit has to have at least an introduction, the basis on which the audit was carried out, why it was carried out, what triggered it and what the terms of reference were. That is the very least. An audit will not just have Margaret's results, Ruth's results and Bríd's results and a description of how they have been looked at. There has to be a description and a report back. We are looking for that to be published. I echo the call by the academy for the 2014 audit to be published. I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment.  When the State Claims Agency, and I think it was Mr. Gleeson, was alerted that there was a claim made by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. O'Brien said he did not know anything about it until last Friday. I do not believe him. I do not believe that the Minister did not know. Other people might believe Mr. O'Brien but I doubt it. I think there are thousands of people out there who do not believe Mr. O'Brien. There may not be a paper trail or a smoking gun, an email or anything else but there could have been a conversation. Did Mr. Gleeson keep this to himself as a secret or did he discuss it verbally with anybody else? Would Mr. Gleeson get information like that, in a position of responsibility, and keep it all to himself? If Mr. O'Brien, as the head of the HSE, did not know until last Friday, he must be hopping mad. He must be looking for heads to roll over this. If he is not, I wonder why. I think anybody else would. I have one more quick question.

Is the screening carried out in Sandyford or do they just dispatch and export the screens off to America? It has been said that the tests are dealt with in Sandyford but are they are carried out there? I am wondering because I am trying to track what is happening. I was talking to my doctor three weeks ago and I am wondering how the decision is made to send a smear to America, to Sandyford or the Coombe?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	557	I will answer the second question first.

I became aware of this in the run-in to the case. At that point, there was an opportunity for mediation. Unfortunately, that was unsuccessful and it went to court.

As said earlier, it was an accelerated process facilitated by everyone in view of the clinical condition that the patient is unfortunately in.

It is my responsibility now to address this issue. I do not know whether the Senator was here for my opening statement.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	595	No, I was at the domestic violence Bill debate but I have the opening statement here. I want to clarify, in terms of accountability and the setup of this in 2008, in spite of all the advice that was given to the witness and the experts that resigned and all that, he made the decision to outsource this screening to America. Is that the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	596	I think the Senator ascribes a bit too much total power to me. In fact, there were other experts who supported that process. There was a national cancer screening service board. There was a debate in the Oireachtas and there was ministerial approval but I certainly supported the decision. Contrary to what was said earlier, nobody was forced to resign and there were a number of steps taken. The issues that were raised at that time did not relate to this process, they related to an earlier process. A total of 1,000 slides had been outsourced as part of a catch-up programme in 2006 to 2007 by the HSE which I did not work for at that time. I worked for another organisation. Certain conclusions were being drawn based on that. Those were addressed in a number of ways.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	597	I am just trying to get to who did the final sign off on this to make the decision, in spite of all the information and the expertise that was being given in terms of the negative externalities which we have talked about in many other cases around the HSE. Who made the final decision on this? Normally somebody signs off on it. Was it made by the HSE in the screening process or was it made by Government?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	598	The actual signing of the contract was authorised by the National Cancer Screening Service Board, which was a State agency, it was not part of the HSE. In fact the original Irish cervical screening programmes set up in the Mid-Western Health Board was part of the HSE and the Government decision was made, I presume it was a Government decision, to transfer it out of the HSE and into a new board which subsumed it and the-----

There is layer after layer but there is nobody who will stand up and say this was his or her decision or there is no group of people that will say they made this decision.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	600	At that time the governance process was quite straightforward. There was a specific, specialised agency for the cancer screening service. I was its chief executive. I was part of that decision; I did not have sole decision making and I believe the decision was correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	602	Yes and I will tell the Senator why. At the time, there was no potential to provide a national cervical screening programme based on the laboratory system that was in place in Ireland at that time. The labs were not accredited. Women were waiting for up to a year for their results. Some of those slides were being read on kitchen tables. That is not a place-----

Was it investment that it required? What did it require?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	604	A report was done on this around 2001 or 2002, I stand to be corrected, which set out the requirements.

It was run to an extent that there would be no alternative, which happens so many times, so it would be outsourced to America. I know I am very limited in time. When I had my smear, why did somebody not tell me there is a 30% chance that this is not going to work or I will not get the correct information? There is a 30% chance so this is what I need to do, that was not communicated to me or to other women.

It is not 100% effective. In the public discourse we have heard a lot of talk about people being given the "all clear". I understand that is a shorthand approach but it conveys a certain meaning. The result is "no abnormality detected". It is not an "all clear".

We sent information to all GPs to equip them to give women the best information.

Is there any kind of standardised process at all?Dr. McKenna said what he would say to women, but clearly he does not see all women. That is what he would say, and something different is said to someone else. I will repeat what I said. If the witnesses came in here to do a damage limitation exercise I strongly suggest they put down the shovel and start answering some questions because this is not acceptable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	659	Yesterday, I was looking at the literature that goes out with the screening programme and I certainly feel some of it should be redrafted to reflect what I consider to be a more realistic appraisal of the validity of screening.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	669	I would say it is in or around 10%.

I want to ask him a direct question. As the former head of the service where did he get his figure from?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	677	From clinical advice at the time but can we let the chief medical officer speak?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	678	What I will point out to the committee is that the statistics here are difficult to understand. There are many different statistics that appear to be in conflict with each other but they are not. When we talk about sensitivity and specificity of a test, it means a different thing when we talk about false positive and false negative. They are technically different things. It is a different thing again in terms of a yield and how likely it is, and how positive one can be that the result that is negative is in fact negative. They are different measures and they are being used interchangeably. It is important we are given time to be able to set this out for the committee in a way it can understand. I am not suggesting Deputy O'Reilly is doing this, but the way in which various statistics are being used is creating an impression that there is a conflict that is not in fact there. If I can give an example, and I am not going to quote in terms of the screening programme and its figures because we can calculate those figures off the performance of our own programme, but if we are talking about something that is 80% sensitive this means there is an 80% chance that if a disease is there a test will find it, and there is a 20% chance that if the disease is there it will not find it. This is what the 80% means. Whether or not we can rely on the test being negative when we get a negative result depends not only on the sensitivity but also on the incidence of the disease in the background population. I appreciate this is a technical epidemiological point I am making. If a disease has a frequency of 1% and a test is applied that has a sensitivity of 80%, there is a different likelihood of it being positive or negative than if the disease had a frequency of one in 10,000. All of these factors bear. The statements that are being made about the performance of the test, and its sensitivity and specificity being low, at in and around 70% in relation to sensitivity, is correct. It is broadly in line with the performance of the test in international hands. Statements have been made about negative predictive value, in other words, if I get a negative test how likely is it that the disease is not present. This is a very small figure. It is a percentage figure that probably for the performance or test might even be much lower than the figure that has been given, and I am not in any sense disputing the figure my clinical colleague has given. He may be referring to a different patient population where a higher incidence of the disease might exist. It is important that we do not get confused and create a sense in which figures that are really important in terms of people's ability to be able to rely on the test and rely on the information they are getting in terms of predictive value, in some way appear on the part of the programme to be confused. I take the point that in general terms the programme should, on a continuing basis like any source of information, continue to improve its communication. This is not in any sense to say that erroneous information is being transmitted to patients. It is really important that we get this point across.

I want to ask Dr. Holohan, Dr. McKenna and Dr. Coffey what they would put on the leaflet to indicate the likelihood of there being a false negative result. It states it may not be 100% accurate. Would they put it at 99%, at 70% as Mr. O'Brien has done, or at 85%? What would they put it at?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	680	I will make a general point, and I do not have the expertise to give a specific number or tight range. I will not put anything forward on that. What I will say is that a point I made earlier is it is probably appropriate to state that in any redesign or review of any of the patient information material, it is important that we get the patient's voice and the patient representative's voice in the room when it is being drafted. I cannot say what-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	683	The level of information and the type of information need to be reviewed. Every couple of years more clinical science data is available. We need to be continuously updated. I cannot remember the data on the current version, but for future versions there will probably be a changed approach.

Perhaps Mr. O'Brien can advise us how many times it was updated when he was in charge of it. Dr. McKenna might also advise on what he would like to see on it instead of it stating that it may not be 100%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	685	I suspect when I was in charge it was the very first version.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	687	I would have to check, but I suspect not.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	689	I said I would prefer to see it reflect what I would consider a more realistic appraisal of its ability to detect what it sets out to detect, and I would put the figure in and around a false negative of 10%.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	694	All of the laboratories we have ever engaged have positive predictive values. If a test states the person has high grade abnormal cells and she then goes on to colposcopy and a biopsy, which is a diagnostic test, a disease that is pre-cancer or cancer is confirmed in the range of 70% to 90% of the time, which is the international rate if we look at screening programmes in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. We monitor this, and it is true for all programme laboratories that have worked with us or are working with us.

I was going to ask a question with regard to the audits, and perhaps Mr. Gleeson would give us a link to the website where we can review all of this audit information because it is extremely important information. The witnesses came in here to talk to us about transparency and accountability, and they might just point us in the direction of where we can get this important information because people want to know.

I want to home in if I can on who knew what, at what stage. I am reading from a letter that was copied to Dr. Henry and Mr. McKenna from a consultant gynaecologist and it is dated 22 August 2017. It states: "What has happened is totally inappropriate." That is referring to withholding of information from women. What I want to know is, given that Dr. Henry, who is here, and Dr. McKenna who is also here, were aware that there were serious concerns, was any of this kicked up the line, and at what point? Mr. Gleeson has already indicated that stuff got kicked up the line. I am not quite sure what that means. We might get a chance to go back to that. Was any of this kicked up the line? I find it absolutely extraordinary that Mr. O'Brien would not have been informed of a senior clinician who had serious issues with regard to the conduct of sharing information with women about themselves, which is material. The consultant said: "It is because I feel that the women deserve to know the results of the audit process." My God, if only other people shared that desire to share the information with women about their own health and well-being. Was Mr. O’Brien, as the head of the HSE, unaware of this? Those are very senior people.

Could I have Mr. O'Brien’s and Mr. McKenna's view on that?

Does Mr. O'Brien consider that important information, which we are now all here talking about, was withheld from him, or would it be routine and he simply did not ask? I am curious to know because, as previously discussed, the buck stops with him, but he does not seem to be taking any responsibility for it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	720	Well, if I can answer the question as opposed to the comment. Was I aware of the correspondence Deputy O'Reilly referenced? The answer is "No". Would I have asked if such correspondence existed? I would not have had any reason to. I have to rely on the layers of senior experts and those who report to me to bring things to me that I should know about.

When Mr. O'Brien found out on the television, as he has told us - I said that stretches credibility - did he then start asking questions? Is he aware of this correspondence now? Where did he go when he started to look for this information?

I would have thought this would have formed part of it.

I thank Mr. O'Brien. I would like to read out what the HSE defines as open disclosure, which is at the heart of all of this.An open, consistent approach to communicating with service users when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the service user informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.So, the question at hand is whether Vicky Phelan was afforded open disclosure, and whether many other women, and possibly men, within the national screening service have been afforded open disclosure, and indeed there is a wider question now across the HSE, due to this. From what I have seen in the past week, there is a conspiracy of silence within the healthcare system when it came to Vicky Phelan's case and when it came to several hundred other women who were not informed of false negatives. Senior people within the national screening service knew the details of Vicky Phelan's case and they knew that hundreds of other women had not been communicated with. Senior management within the HSE knew those things as well, and the doctors knew those things - maybe not in the hundreds but they knew that their own patients had not been communicated with. People at the very highest levels within the HSE, at the level of direct reporting to Mr. O'Brien, at a senior level within the national screening service and senior consultants, all knew for years that the false negatives had occurred and as of today all of the women still have not been told. I will start with Dr. Henry. We know that he was made aware of this issue, not just Vicky Phelan's case, but the wider issue of women not being afforded open disclosure, why did he not inform Mr. O'Brien as the head of the HSE, and why did he not act to begin to put in place the measures which are now being put in place, in an emergency response - because this has gone public? Why, when he was told about this, did he not act to ensure that all of these women were afforded open disclosure, as is clearly required under HSE policy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	738	In my then role as clinical adviser I was informed by the clinical director of a hospital group of his concerns over who was responsible for disclosure of this information, so I immediately consulted with the women and infants health programme and contacted the medical director of cervical screening asking her opinion and her response to the concerns raised by the clinical director in the hospital group. The reply I received from the cervical screening programme was that it was the responsibility of the caring clinicians to provide this information. There was an exchange of correspondence and meetings on advice I received from other relevant clinical leads which culminated in a meeting between the lead colposcopists, that is the clinicians, and the medical director of the screening programme on 1 September, three months later - the first correspondence I received was on 11 July. I received correspondence the following week from the medical director of the screening programme saying that they had changed the policy regarding communication and that further meetings were planned with the colposcopists so there would be consensus as to how they were going to communicate with patients, who was going to take responsibility and when this would happen.

My question is that Dr. Henry was made aware of a very serious breach of open disclosure, it would appear that when he was made aware, actions were not taken to ensure that the women were informed. Why?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	740	At that time I was working as a clinical adviser and what I did was I engaged with the people, including the medical director of cervical screening, and the hospital group clinical directors and relevant clinical leads to facilitate a discussion that would lead towards that. That was the role I played there. I received assurances subsequently that that meeting had taken place, that the communication policy had changed, and that there was agreement as to how communication would take place.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	742	Rather than escalating a problem I usually try to engage directly with the problem myself, which is exactly what I did. I consulted with the relevant clinical leads, the clinical director of the hospital group, the clinician concerned and the medical director of CervicalCheck on a number of occasions. After those meetings those people dealt directly with the clinicians, after which I was told that a consensus had been achieved.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	743	We now know that no action occurred. We know that three in four women were not told. We know that there were open disputes, which Dr. Henry was brought into, between a clinician and the service. Dr. Henry has just stated to the committee that as far as he is concerned he initiated the process, took the appropriate action, and was led to believe that things were happening. Does he, bearing in mind what we now know, believe he was misinformed by other parts of the HSE? It seems he was led to believe things were happening that clearly were not happening.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	744	Knowing what I know now, it was clear that the most important part of all the engagement and communication was of course that women would be told. Yes, of course.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	750	The question I was asked was about the CervicalCheck programme.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	751	I want to challenge that statement for several reasons. We have a circular from CervicalCheck, saying to doctors that in instances where the woman is still alive they should use their judgement, and that in instances where the woman is deceased it should be noted on the file. We also have a letter from Dr. Hickey, Vicky Phelan's consultant, to CervicalCheck, addressed to Dr. Gráinne Flannelly. It stated that on further reviewing the letter CervicalCheck sent down to Dr. Hickey with respect to an audit of the cervical smears on cancer patients, CervicalCheck highlighted just three it felt should be considered for recall on discussion. Dr. Hickey wrote there were a number of others that looked as though there were significant discrepancies, and he was somewhat uncomfortable about just recalling the three that CervicalCheck had highlighted. Dr. Hickey had ten patients. This was active correspondence from a consultant saying this matter was affecting ten of his patients. Doctors have been told to use their discretion, but clearly Dr. Hickey was being told by CervicalCheck that only three of the ten needed to be told. Given that information, and given what was in the circular, does Mr. Gleeson stand over the statement that there was never a decision not to disclose? If so, how does he stand over it? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	752	The Deputy is referring to ten cases. The process was under discussion between two senior clinical people - consultant doctors - about how to disclose. We had already sent the information to the receiving clinician. There is an assumption that the other nine cases were identical to the one that has appeared in court. I doubt if any two cases are the same, so I believe caution should be exercised. I am certainly not going to reveal the details of those cases. We had disclosed. We had sent it on and asked that it be taken further. The commentary around that - and I will not speak for Dr. Flannelly, who is still here - was that this consultant sought assistance in reviewing patient notes. That was done collaboratively, and it was decided who should immediately be told. One does not know whether one of those reviews had changed anything or not.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	754	We do not know whether the situation was the same, but it was clearly identified in that case that it should be reviewed, and it did happen.

Turning to Mr. O'Brien, in 2013 the open disclosure policy came into effect. In 2014 there was an audit. In 2015 a decision was taken to share the results with the women; two years after open disclosure came in. In 2016 the information was shared with the doctors. In 2017 Vicky Phelan got the information on her smears. Given that timeline, does Mr. O'Brien believe the HSE has failed in its duty of open disclosure and in its duty to these 208 women?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	756	Yes, I do.

How did so many people in the HSE, including clinicians and managers, stay quiet in what clearly was an egregious breach of open disclosure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	758	I do not know that they stayed quiet, because there does seem to have been quite a lot of discussion and debate, which appears to have been intended to bring a resolution to the matter. I said in response to a question earlier - I believe the Deputy was out of the room - that at an earlier stage it would have been appropriate for someone to put their hand up to say that the process was taking too long and that the fact that there was an ongoing discussion about how to do it rather than doing it needed more significant intervention. It should have been escalated, if necessary, all the way to myself, although I would have hoped it would not have had to get that far. The fact that that escalation did not occur is a source of concern.

The principles of open disclosure in the HSE are: acknowledgement; truthfulness, timeliness and clarity of communication; apology-expression of regret, recognising the expectations of service users, that they may reasonably expect to be fully informed of the facts and consequences in relation to an adverse event; and clinical governance. Does Mr. O'Brien believe that the case of Vicky Phelan and the subsequent cases constitutes a failure of clinical and managerial governance within the HSE?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	764	I will check my opening statement; I believe it is dealt with there.

Under a framework agreement, as the Deputy probably knows, the arrangement is that the service is not fully tendered, in the way it would be in the absence of a framework agreement. Mr. Gleeson can update us on how that framework agreement has proceeded.

Many members have asked questions, so I just want to be clear.Is Mr. O'Brien telling us that he is happy with the standards of the three or four labs being used - it does not matter to me how many - both American and Irish? As head of the HSE, does he think, not in his personal opinion but from evidence, that they are up to scratch for the provision of this service to the women of Ireland?  I have a second question. Before the 2014 audit that led to the recent findings, I am led to believe that there were two years of audit that were used for education and training purposes. Might Mr O'Brien explain why that happened? When the real audit of real people's data happened in 2014 and this rate of false negatives was identified, did the HSE compare the rates of false negatives and false positives of the four individual labs? That is the first batch of questions. I am sure Mr. Gleeson and Mr. O'Brien can answer those. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	780	I think I need to clarify. People are talking, I do not know why, about a 2014 audit. In the court case that has been subject of much discussion, the diagnosis was made in 2014 and that triggered the review. The audit process is that if there is a diagnosis of cancer, a review starts. We look at the previous screening history prior to-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	782	That is continuous. There is no individual 2014 audit. It went on during 2010, 2011 and 2012.

There is lab A, lab B, lab C and lab D. Did the HSE look at each lab's smears and the resultant false negatives? I think it is a "yes" or "no" answer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	784	We looked at the count, which is too small to measure.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	786	Laboratories examine 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 or 100,000 samples per annum. Three false negatives might emerge three years later when we go back and look at them. Meanwhile, we are monitoring the period in question, and the positive predictive value is correct for their quarterly measure. It is complex. We are monitoring all the time. The false negative rate can only be determined against what, all the other positives? There could be 70,000 negatives, and three that might be false negatives when one looks back three years later under review conditions. It is minuscule.

There is no comprehension issue here. Mr. Gleeson is referring to the Irish cohort of women. However, the lab is obviously doing American smears too. Obviously, they would not be minuscule figures. Has the HSE looked at all of the work being done by a lab?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	792	I am not saying statistically, but it is very hard to compare 0.001% and 0.0011%. It does not jump out.

I have a question for Mr. O'Brien. How can Irish clinicians conduct multi-disciplinary teamwork with people in different time zones, who use different nomenclature and perhaps different terminology regarding cervical cytology? That is the first question. Second, from the time the cervical screening programme was introduced, and we did not have the capacity in Ireland because there was a backlog, was any attempt made by the HSE to increase the capacity in the Irish system? When the backlog was dealt with abroad, was the HSE working to ramp up capacity in the Irish system, based on the concerns of clinicians in Ireland in 2008? Doing the job in the United States was a third of the price of what it was here. Did that ring any alarm bells when it came to quality analysis? I have come upon the McGoogan report from 2004, which laid out what we should be doing before we had the screening programme. Here is recommendation 1.7 on how it should be conducted:"A management structure with clear governance arrangements is required to ensure that the legal obligations to eligible women, health care professionals and staff participating in the Programme including Phase One are met." Another recommendation: "The establishment of effective governance arrangements with immediate effect is necessary in order to provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy development", and so on. Recommendation 1.12: "A quality assurance (QA) programme should continue to be given priority in the ICSP." The report further recommends that:"Structures must be put in place to allow review or revision of quality standards by a National ICSP Quality Assurance Committee which should include representation from the Professional bodies, other key stakeholders such as the Cancer Registry, the Cancer Society and other cancer screening programmes". It seems that much of what was recommended did not actually happen. Then I found the women's charter. This is addressed to the women: "All members of CervicalCheck staff will respect your privacy, dignity, religion, race and cultural beliefs." It makes a commitment that women would always have the opportunity to make their views known and to have them taken into account. Women are assured that their smear tests will be screened in an accredited quality-assured lab. CervicalCheck also committed that a woman's result and any treatment recommendations would be provided to her and her nominated smear taker by the programme within four weeks. In regard to that last point of the women's charter, I do not think Vicky Phelan got what it said on the tin. Would Mr. O'Brien agree? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	794	Clearly in relation to being communicated with around the outcome of the review, no. On the point in the charter about four weeks, this is intended to refer to the initial smear test. The fact that this is what the charter is referring to does not take way from the fact that Vicky Phelan should have had open disclosure in relation to the outcome of the review into her particular case that was carried out.

At the initiation of this process, was there any standard operating procedure for crisis management in case of something like this? It does not look like one was followed. The response seems to have been ad hoc. People were trying to get messages up the line to wherever. I think this is a yes or no question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	796	There are comprehensive standard operating procedures for the cervical screening programme, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	802	Individually performing. There is a QA programme of the type described by Dr. McGoogan in the report that Deputy O'Connell referenced. Mr. Gleeson is in charge of that overall. I am aware that there is now a debate in which some people are saying that it would be better if we created cervical cytology capability in Ireland.

What I would say is that wherever the screening takes place, there is no point in recreating cervical cytology experience, because by the end of this year that test will be obsolete. The screening programme will move to human papillomavirus, HPV, testing, which will deal with many of the vagaries that we have discussed today.

There seem to be a lot of people involved and a lot of people moving around the organisational structure, being in one place and going to another place. It is very hard to track who was in what job when, and who was responsible.Does Mr. O'Brien accept at this point that the organisational structure of the HSE is not fit for purpose because it does not actually have anything to do with organisation? To my mind, it is to do with diminishing pathways to accountability or somehow making it more confusing for people like me. Mr. O'Brien is head of the HSE. Given that we are dealing with a subset of population the size of a major city in the UK and have made such a hames of the situation, I do not know how he thinks his position is tenable at this stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	808	Does the Deputy want me to answer that question?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	810	I was appointed to this role. Rather, I was invited to take up the role on the basis of a set of Government policies which were about the abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance. So I did the job in a particular way, in the context of that, for close to three years, expecting to be winding down the organisation and moving it into a collection of different types of service providers, hospital groups on a statutory basis and community health organisations. As the Deputy knows, that did not happen. I had discussions with the relevant Ministers. What we have actually been doing is seeking to prepare the HSE for the type of future envisaged in the Sláintecare report as a result of which Government sanctioned: the appointment of a chief operations officer so that there is very clear accountability for the operating system; the appointment of a strategy and planning head in order that we have much more focus on planning to population need, as they do in other countries; and, just recently, for the first time ever in the Irish healthcare system, the appointment of a chief clinical officer. So what I have been attempting to do in the second three years, and it has been extraordinarily slow because of the approvals processes one must go through, is come to a much more streamlined system of governance. That is the only reason people have moved around in this context. In an organisation the size of the HSE, people move around. They have opportunities to apply for different jobs, posts become vacant and other people come in. Yes, it is complicated. An organisation the scale of the HSE is inherently complex. I have long maintained that the structures of the HSE are in fact not fit for purpose. I have been saying that throughout my time. I have now got to a point where I think, subject to the implementation plan for Sláintecare, that there is a much coherent organisation of functions at the top level which is useful and valid. It is extraordinary that, for the very first time, the Irish health system has a chief clinical officer - appointed within the past four or five weeks. I am very glad to have been the one who brought that about.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	811	I will follow up on the point Deputy Donnelly raised with Dr. Henry regarding the decision-making process and how it seemed to go around in circles. I am sorry for coming back on this. Did it not occur to Dr. Henry that, in the context of the delay in making the decision about getting the information out, someone should have sought legal advice about whether we could run into difficulties about not disclosing this information and the delay in making the disclosure? Did it concern Dr. Henry that there might be a legal problem caused by not making the disclosure in a timely manner? The next issue is the time it takes to make a decision. We are going over a period where no decision was made. Did that not concern Dr. Henry? He was the clinical officer. Will this be the process in the future regarding any decisions that are to be made? Will it go around the house and back again to the same place where it was two years previously? Did that occur to Dr. Henry at the time? I know he was not clinical director but surely it must have occurred to him that this delay was not acceptable. My second question concerns the role of clinical director. The clinical director was in situ for quite a period. I know we are going back to 2008 when this process was set up. The masters of the Coombe, Holles Street and the Rotunda have seven-year contracts. In fairness, any of these roles are extremely demanding. The person is dealing with a huge number of people and a number of different units throughout the country. Likewise, a master of one of the maternity hospitals faces a huge number of demands. Does Dr. McKenna not think the way forward might be to stipulate a defined period for the director's job? The director can reapply when the job comes up for review but that process would be there. I am just looking at the way forward. What kind of timescale would be involved if we decided tomorrow morning that we wanted all smear tests to be dealt with here? I know the Coombe is carrying out some analysis in this area in the sense that it is providing a service. My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland had a laboratory but that this service has now gone out to private enterprise. I stand open to correction on that. The process is being provided in Ireland. How long would it take to put in place the requisite number of people with the skills necessary to deal with all of the smear tests that are done here? Would it take two, three or four years? What kind of period would it take us to build up those skills? It is important to look at that. Given that we have been sending tests out and using US companies for over ten years, surely we should be looking at trying to keep all of this work within the Irish jurisdiction.

It was presented to me by our clinical director in seeking advice in my then role as a clinical adviser.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	818	I did. I wrote to CervicalCheck on two occasions and engaged directly with it. I wrote to the clinical director who first raised issues with me and held a number of meetings with relevant clinical leads to address this issue. As I said, this led to a direct meeting and engagement between the clinicians involved with the service and CervicalCheck, after which I came to believe that they had come to a resolution between them.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	824	I was told at the time that a policy of communication from the cervical screening programme had changed, that it was engaging directly with the clinicians and that consensus would arise out of that engagement.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	832	In retrospect I was wrong, but my hope was that once these clinicians and directors in the cervical screening programme came together and arrived at a consensus, it would lead to patients being informed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	833	The Senator asked a question about the length of time it is suitable for a director to be in place and cited the seven years which masters of the Dublin maternity hospitals spend in their positions. That is probably at the upper end of what is acceptable for a clinical director. After that period one could be replaced or reconsidered but a term exceeding seven years is probably too long. Was that the Senator's question?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	835	Most certainly, yes. The thing about the seven years for the Dublin maternity hospitals is that the term cannot be repeated. It is a one-off appointment.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	836	Yes, that is right.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	837	Once a person has done seven years and given his or her best, that is it. A shorter period of time might allow for the possibility of a person being reappointed for another three, four or five years if that person was doing the job well and if everyone agreed. Seven years does not allow for a reappointment. It is too long. I certainly agree that appointing a person for a set period of time is far more appropriate than appointing someone until retirement.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	839	I will answer that. Later this year there will be a change away from cytology to the HPV test for primary screening. This will have the effect that the cytology capacity required by the programme will fall from approximately 280,000 cases per annum to 50,000 to 70,000 per annum. This is because if the HPV test is negative, the patient or client will simply return to routine HPV testing. If it is positive, that is, if HPV is detected, it will be followed up by cytology. The expectation is that will be in the range of 50,000 to 70,000 cases, which is less than the number of cytology tests currently being conducted onshore.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	840	Could what Mr. O'Brien is talking about rolling out in October now be rolled out at an earlier date?

Our next contributor is Deputy Durkan. We are getting tired, so can we really concentrate on the issue at hand, which is the women involved in this, for want of a better word, scandal?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	848	I will do my best not to falter in the course of my contribution. I want to mention two or three things which have come to my mind. The statement provided to the committee by Dr. Holohan states:Patients have a right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm. This is underpinned in the Medical Practitioners Code of Conduct and the HSE Open Disclosure Policy. The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act ... These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for staff to be open and transparent with patients.How does that sit with current events? It is very laudable but it does not seem to have been part and parcel of the daily exercise of the HSE in all its workings. That is one question. The other thing I notice is that in 2009 HIQA conducted a survey which concluded that the system warranted an ISO 9001 accreditation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	849	HIQA noted that it had that accreditation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	851	Yes. It had been in place since before the establishment of CervicalCheck under the Irish cervical screening programme pilot in the mid-west and it was noted in HIQA's report.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	855	In terms of the things which that accreditation covers, yes. It would not cover the process we are talking about. Against the original quote, which came from the chief medical officer's opening statement, had the experience of the patients involved lived up to that standard, we would not be here today, so clearly it did not.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	856	A new system is anticipated with greater sensitivity and greater accuracy in the determination of the positive existence of the disease. I presume that is a very new system.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	857	It is already being used as a reflex in the programme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	858	Dr. Holohan might know more about this, but the HPV test being recommended for use is considered to have a higher sensitivity to the disease, meaning that if one gets a negative result, the negative predictive value is better than that achieved through cytology. There is less risk of a false negative or that a person will develop cervical cancer within the next appreciable interval to the next test.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	860	It would be considered more sensitive but less specific. There is a risk of more false positives and we must put a pathway in to guard against that.

Will they converge? Are we bringing the screening nearer to the diagnosis? Will the witnesses tell me more?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	862	The diagnosis is not made until a sample is looked at under a microscope histologically. That requires a biopsy to be taken. Only then can what is until then a well-informed impression which is likely to be correct be confirmed. The ultimate arbiter is a pathologist looking at a sample under a microscope. Only then can a definitive diagnosis be given.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	863	It is said that any system is only as good as its weakest point. Would any of the witnesses like to comment on what might be the weakest point in the issue which has led us to where we are?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	864	That is a very perceptive question. There are many places in which a screening service can fall down. In the first place, one has to get the patient to the doctor or practice nurse. One has to get the practice nurse to take the sample correctly. One then has to get the sample to the laboratory where it must be processed correctly and then one has to get the information which the laboratory generates back to the referring doctor and to the patient. Clearly, in this process, where the system has broken down is beyond the steps which I have laid out. It broke down where a quality assurance programme was instituted, which was found to have failed. In its failure, that information was not passed on.The steps I have pointed out have worked pretty well, but it is the step beyond that, which is the conveying of wrong information to the patient, is the reason we are here.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	865	Has the witness identified precisely the weakest point or points, in the event of there being more than one which obviously there are?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	866	One must start off with the first point, which is that one must get the right people to enter into the service. Traditionally with cervical screening, certainly up until instituting national screening, it was the well informed and well off woman who had availed of the benefits of screening. When one introduces a population-based screening such as this, one eliminates that as much as one can and one includes the entire population. However, it remains a challenge to get everybody in the target population to avail of the service. That is one weakness any screening service will have. The concern will be that the debacle surrounding this, as it was referred to, will make it more difficult to make inroads into the number of women who will not be availing of the service. Getting the right woman to avail of the service is the first step. Ideally, the service should be trying to get to nearly 100% but no service achieves that for a variety of reasons, some of which are very valid.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	868	I am happy that most of the steps I pointed out are being dealt with very well. What we are talking about today is how to make what is a satisfactory service better and more comprehensive, in that it will make sure the patient will be informed not only if the result is positive at the time, which is usually considered to be the challenge, but also that if it subsequently turns out to be positive and one looks back and it was negative that will also be included as part of the process. That is where the system has fallen down on this occasion.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	869	Mr. O'Brien will recall that I have been a critic of the structure of the HSE for a long time. I never agreed with it and I never will. I believe it is the wrong structure to deliver services here, although I am not asking anybody to comment on that at this stage. However, I am raising whether a different structure might have been more alert and responsive, whereby the alarm bells about what might have happened might have gone off at an earlier stage and generated a reaction to it. If the witness was to make recommendations, apart from the ones he just mentioned, relating to the structures of delivering the services to the population of this country, what would they be?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	870	My involvement with the cervical screening programme has been fairly limited. We are talking about days. I believe it would benefit from being part of a bigger structure. It appears to have been working in a relative silo so the values may have gone relatively unchallenged, whereas if one broadens out the base of participation these values will be challenged and, hopefully, be more comprehensive and fit in with the values we are hearing reflected today.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	871	I wish to offer a slightly alternative perspective, having been chief executive of the national cancer screening service when it was a stand-alone agency. This does not fundamentally disagree with what Dr. McKenna is saying because he is talking about the present day context. I spent a number of years doing my best to try to prevent the national cancer screening service board ending up as part of the HSE - it is ironic that I am now the director general of the HSE, although not for too much longer - and I believe that had governance with a non-executive board remained closer to the screening programmes red flags would have been raised more quickly, more locally and more effectively in that structure.

We all know the mistakes were made with disclosure. I believe a very paternalistic attitude towards women pervades the Irish health service, and it is probably reflected in what happened. However, I wish to focus on the testing because my concern is that once one turns the health service to a profit motive one gets these mistakes. The witnesses are at pains to assure us that is not the case, but they have not been able to provide the results from the different laboratories which might go some way to reassuring us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	874	We have agreed to provide them.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	875	Yes, but I cannot judge and this is the only chance I have to ask questions. To be honest, that information should be at the top as the witnesses knew this issue had emerged in the press. The witness made some disparaging remarks about tests being done on the kitchen table. That is at odds with what Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said. He is not an insignificant person as a former master of the Rotunda Hospital and he called the service it ran accredited and world class. One cannot dismiss the fact that this was predicted by people ten years ago. In addition, they said it would be ten years before these problems would emerge. Some €20 per test multiplied by 3 million, which is €60 million, was paid to a private company which makes massive profits and has connections with Goldman Sachs. These people are in it for a reason, and it is not for patients. That was not purely the HSE's decision. The witness is correct that the Dáil voted for that, despite counter arguments at the time. The majority of parties, even if they ranted about it at the time, did not challenge it when they came into power. It is the issue of public services being starved of resources and then being privatised. I have a question about the rate of testing. My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that the NHS guidelines are that 50 tests per day is the recommended best practice level. Quest Diagnostics was doing 90 to 100. I tried to calculate the figures by dividing 25,000 by 365, but presumably laboratories do not operate for 365 days a year. They might take weekends off, but I do not know. However, the rate in Quest Diagnostics must have been nearly twice what the NHS recommends. A screener is only supposed to carry out a maximum of 5,000 per year. If there is pressure to make profit by getting as many tests carried out as possible these things are absolutely inevitable. Corners were cut in women's health at a time when the economy was going into recession. Again, political parties took that decision. Why did CervicalCheck downgrade, as I have read, from two deep checks to one deep check and one rapid check in 2011?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	876	The chief medical officer wishes to comment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	877	I wish to make a general point and not to take issue with many of the specifics Deputy Coppinger has raised or, indeed, the legitimacy of questions about laboratories and contracts being raised. I have been doing some calculations and I can give some general figures for the purpose of illustration. What I am trying to address here is a sense that we have evidence of a substantial failure of the cytology service that people here depend on for the reliability of the tests. We have to try to reassure people about that because they are genuinely worried and concerned. We carry out approximately 250,000 smears per year. The abnormal rate that is reported, between high grades and low grades, is approximately 8,000. I will call that 10,000 for the purpose of simplicity. That is 240,000 negative test results per year. We know we have approximately 300 incident cases of cervical cancer in this country per year.We believe the test performs at the rate of about 70% sensitivity. That means it misses about 30% of cancers that are present at the time of testing. For simplicity, we will say that works out to be somewhere in the region of 100 false negatives. That gives a false negative rate of substantially less than 1%, therefore, when the accuracy figure of 99% set out in the figures is quoted, it is based on statistics like that. That is a back of the envelope calculation. What I am trying to illustrate is that the general assertion - I do not suggest Deputy Coppinger is making this particular assertion - is that there is some evidence here of a substantial failure in the cytology service being used to give people reassurance. We simply do not have evidence of that. There have been substantial failures. There has been clear admission in regard to them, particularly in terms of unacceptable failures of communication to patients, but that cannot be equated with a statement or review. I have to make that point about the cytology service and the evidence we have in terms of performance. The point has been made by the director general that the differential performance, about which again there is a legitimate question, can be provided by way of response to the committee. That may well help to satisfy some of the questions that have been asked.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	878	I am going to extend Dr. Holohan's time. I have a question on that. In a case of a false negative, and the frequency of testing is every three years, the rate of growth of cervical cancer is slow. If someone has a false negative and she comes back in three years' time, is there an estimation of how advanced that cancer would have progressed in those three years? The benefit of screening is that women are screened every three years in order that a profile of the patient is being built up. If there is a false negative on one smear, how much of a change would be expected in a three-year period?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	879	I could hazard offering an answer on that. Once a woman has a visible, invasive cervical cancer, she will probably live without treatment for about 18 to 24 months. However, we know, and this is one of the best studied areas of screening in any part of the body, that to get to that stage there is a pre-invasive stage that may take as long as 12 or 15 years, which starts off as a mild abnormality and usually progresses at a reasonable rate to a severe abnormality and then to cancer. At any of those stages it can revert back to being normal, but the nearer one gets to having an invasive cervical cancer, the more likely it is to progress into being an invasive cancer. The premise of the Chairman's question is whether one has several opportunities to catch it before it becomes invasive. The answer is one has many opportunities. This test, which has a high false negative rate, works because one has several attempts at it over the ten or 12-year period before it turns into an invasive cancer. If it progressed more rapidly and the test was as good as it is now, it would not work but because it progresses so slowly, this test, which has error built into it, works.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	880	To go back to the Deputy's question about the prediction Dr. David Gibbons made, I heard him saying that what is happening now is what he predicted. What is happening now is not what he predicted. What he predicted was that there would be a very high incidence of missed cancers. The chief medical officer has just taken us through an explanation of why that is not what we are experiencing. Dr. Gibbons did not predict that there would be a review process that would go so terribly wrong in terms of its communication to patients. That review process going terribly wrong has got nothing to do with where the slides were read. Such a review process would have had to occur wherever those slides were processed, including here, and there were such misses when the programme was based in Ireland in terms of its cytology process. If the same flawed process of communication had occurred, we would still be here having this discussion because it is fundamentally not about an excessive level of miss, taking into account the limitations of this test. Clearly, any miss is highly regrettable. While we have this programme, the whole purpose is to prevent cervical cancer. We do not take some satisfaction from the fact that the miss rate here is simply that which would normally be expected. We would wish we had a better test, and we will move to a better test, but what Dr. Gibbons predicted is not what we are experiencing. What we are experiencing does not vindicate the arguments he made ten years ago, however valid. This does not prove that he was right.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	891	Different laboratories.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	892	From different laboratories.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	893	All laboratories.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	894	Can Mr. Gleeson not say how many of them came from the United States, Sandyford and the Coombe? I would imagine that figure is in his head somewhere and that he knows it. If he does not, he is not doing a proper job. That is a fundamental question in terms of what was said in 2008. Mr. O'Brien misrepresented Dr. Gibbons and the obstetrician when he said that that is not what they predicted. They predicted that in about ten years' time we would see the results of poor-quality testing that had been outsourced to America. That is what Dr. Gibbons argued at the time. We are seeing that now but what we are also seeing is an attempt to cover it up. That is why we want to know what was reported to whom on which I have a few questions to ask.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	895	Can I respond to these questions and then take the Deputy's questions? Would that be reasonable?
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	896	Yes, but I do have questions. Can I ask them after Mr. O'Brien responds?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	898	We agree about what Dr. Gibbons predicted. We are clear that that is not what has happened.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	899	I am not clear on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	900	The chief medical officer has been quite clear in terms of the incidence of false negatives resulting in later diagnosis of cancer. We are not seeing something that is out of line with what might reasonably be expected in a screening programme based on this technology. However, with the Chairman's agreement, we will provide full written information on the questions that have just been asked because it is far better done by giving it to the Deputy in writing than seeking to give her that kind of information verbally.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	903	We can identify it by laboratory. I am not sure we will name the laboratories but we will identify-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	904	We will certainly be able to see-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	905	-----the laboratories as A, B or C.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	906	Why would Mr. Gleeson not name them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	907	Hold on a second. I am answering the question. The answer is "Yes".
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	908	Mr. O'Brien will name them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	909	Yes.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	910	He will not refer to them as laboratory A, B or C.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	911	No.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	912	He will name them and we will be able to clearly see whether what Dr. Gibbons said in 2008 was correct, namely, that outsourcing would lead to an increased number of false negative results in ten years' time. If that is not the case, why did CPL settle the case with Vicky Phelan for €2.5 million? Why would it do that? Why would it say, "here is €2.5 million but there is no issue here with us having poor quality testing"? Our contention is that the outsourcing has delivered poor-quality services in cervical screening for women.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	913	I understand the Deputy's contention but it is also the case that before cytology screening was outsourced to America or anywhere else, there were situations where payments ordered by the court arose regarding false negatives.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	914	I do not want to get into that yet as I will lose my time and I want to ask the chief medical officer a question. At any stage did the chief medical officer have a discussion with the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, be it a conversation over a cup of coffee or in a corridor, about the Vicky Phelan case in advance of the Minister being formally told through the note he read out in the Dáil last night? Mr. Gleeson kicked it up the line. Who did Mr. Gleeson kick it up the line to? There are two heads of screening; one is the head of the national cervical screening programme, Dr. Gráinne Flannelly, and the other is the national head of screening overall, Charles O' Hanlon. To whom was this kicked up the line and what did they do with the information? Did they at any stage kick it further up the line to the chief medical officer and did he tell the Minister? If he did not, why did he not?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	915	Did I have a conversation about Vicky Phelan's case with the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the corridor or over cup of coffee? The answer is "No".
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	916	Dr. Holohan knew about it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	917	I knew about the case, yes.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	918	But Dr. Holohan did not tell him at any stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	919	No I did not tell him. The Minister had a briefing note, which included contributions from my division but I did not speak to him directly about it, no.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	920	Before the briefing note, was there any indication about it in private conversation? Anything at all?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	921	Never.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	922	Never. I know there were no emails and no smoking gun but was it never mentioned to him?

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	925	I put this question to Mr. Gleeson. Who did he kick it up the line to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	926	When I was involved with the State Claims Agency, if there was a case it was the head of screening services.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	927	Was that Charles O'Hanlon or Dr. Gráinne Flannelly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	928	They have two different titles, from what has been read out. I gave the title to the Deputy.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	929	Who was it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	930	I was asked to not name people who are not in the room. I am sorry but-----
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	931	I just named them both.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	932	-----I am just trying to follow protocol.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	934	The head of the national screening service.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	935	So it was Charles O'Hanlon to whom Mr. Gleeson kicked the issue. Does the chief medical officer know if he kicked it up any further?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	936	Sorry?
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	937	Did Charles O'Hanlon kick it up further?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	938	The Department was notified.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	939	By Charles O'Hanlon.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	940	By the screening service, yes, that there was a case. The members have seen the facts of the case because it is covered in detail in the briefing note.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	944	We got his title.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	945	The Chairman names people all the time.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	946	As my mother used to say, "All you have to do is ask Dougal." We just have to Google it and we will find out who it is.

I want to home in on the relationship between the HSE, the State Claims Agency and the processes involved there. Mr. O'Brien has said he had no knowledge of it but perhaps he can explain what contact the HSE has with the State Claims Agency.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	948	Mr. Lynch will cover that aspect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	949	There are multiple contacts between the HSE and the State Claims Agency. On one side of the house they are the indemnifier for the health service-----
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	950	Maybe we will narrow it down a small bit. What would the process be around the State Claims Agency with regard to Vicky Phelan's case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	951	I cannot describe it in the context of Vicky Phelan's case but the State Claims Agency has the statutory responsibility for managing the legal end. I cannot comment because I was not involved in that case. I could not give the specific detail of that.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	952	Does the State Claims Agency seek advice? Would the agency come to the cervical screening board to seek advice on whether or not the agency should go ahead with the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	953	I stand to be corrected by my colleague here but I understand the agency managed this case. As it was approaching, mediation efforts were made by the cervical screening programme to discuss the particulars with the State Claims Agency - the direction of the request was from CervicalCheck to the State Claims Agency. I cannot remember how successful that effort was.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	954	Yes. Proceedings were made against naming the HSE and another entity, which happened to be a laboratory. We were informed of that and the State Claims Agency asked if the contract indemnified the HSE in respect of the reading of a test with regard to a co-defendant. We went to work on that and found that it does. The plaintiff's legal team was asked if it would drop the case and make it just against the co-defendant, and they said "No". The legal team said it had an issue around the delay in informing the affected woman. That element of the case was struck out; it was not that we did not tell the patient, it was noted that the information was late and took a long time. That was the basis. After that, any engagement largely centred on legal teams and we were asked if a settlement was proposed during mediation prior to a court appearance. The State Claims Agency advised that we should be supportive of any such moves. We took the agency's advice and said "Yes".
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	955	In discussions I had with the State Claims Agency it wanted to make very clear that the public reporting about a confidentiality agreement did not originate with the State Claims Agency and the HSE put on the record at the time its objection to it. That was a specific requirement of the other defendant, which was the laboratory. It would never be a case - that I am aware of - that we would seek to enter into something like that, or that the State Claims Agency would. The agency was very clear that it would like that message to be known more broadly.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	956	So the HSE would never seek a person to sign a confidentiality agreement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	957	I have no evidence that has ever been the case. Certainly, in my discussions with the State Claims Agency it has said it would not be a view it would take. I cannot answer for all the cases they have held, but in talking to the head of the State Claims Agency it is very clear that this is not something it would-----
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	958	Generally the HSE does not require or seek confidentiality clauses or agreements?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	959	I am not aware-----
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	960	Perhaps Mr. O' Brien could answer that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	961	The HSE certainly does not. The legal strategy is directed by the State Claims Agency and I understand it does not do that. The HSE would never be in a position of leading or directing the legal strategy in any case. Under the relevant legislation it is the State Claims Agency that takes the lead on all such cases.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	962	I completely understand that but I am trying to establish if the State Claims Agency seeks advice from the HSE about if a case is winnable or should it go ahead with a case. I find it absolutely disgusting the way that Vicky Phelan and many others are dragged through the courts. Who is the State Claims Agency accountable to? Who does it seek advice from on whether or not a claim is winnable and whether or not it should go ahead with a case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	963	The State Claims Agency makes its own judgments around the balance of probabilities in a case. The agency would obtain the relevant information and files from the relevant part of the service. The agency makes its own determinations.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	965	There is a question in from the committee on that-----

As well as the additional 1,500 women who had cancer diagnoses - and the pretty frightening implications given that 208 women's false negative results missed their cancer - of the original 1,482 only some 400 of those women were included in the audit. Is this correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	971	Yes. If I may talk the Deputy through that-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	975	Flags with regard to any element on the pathway, from being invited for a smear, attending for a smear, results, revisits, every single issue. Only one component of that was examined in the pathway, namely, cytology, where a smear would be flagged with a view to a look-back being required.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	977	With the diagnosis of cervical cancer, one would get the record, match it with the screening register, and look at the history. The woman was invited for a screening test, had the test, had an abnormal result, was referred for a colposcopy, had a biopsy and a diagnosis of cancer. The screening detected that and there would be nothing to review because the system would have worked. There would be no further review in those cases and it would not be flagged. If one wants one of the 29% mentioned by Dr. Coffey which was flagged for further review, the easiest example -----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	979	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	980	My understanding is that the vast majority of the 1,482 cases were found appropriately by cytology and referred for colposcopy and the diagnosis was made in that way. The number was narrowed down to the 400 figure which the Deputy mentioned, and out of those the other concerns were removed, as we have heard. In the remaining 208 cases, cytology was the remaining issue. It was those 208 cases where there a possibility of false negative cytology.

I now return to the testing and warnings. When Dr. David Gibbons, Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith and others made their warnings and indicated their fears on the consequences of outsourcing, it was not mere speculation. They had evidence, namely, that the positive rate coming from US laboratories, because of a different methodology or system, was 1.2 rather than 1.8 in Ireland. Were they correct at that time? Was that true then? Is that evidence correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	982	That requires more than a "Yes" or "No" answer, but I will be very brief. They were basing that on a sample of 1,000 slides which had been outsourced from the St. Luke's laboratory and which were not subject to the same requirements as the contract in place from 2008 under CervicalCheck. While they were correct in what they said, what they referred to was not what CervicalCheck does.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	983	Mr. O'Brien is saying that the detection rate improved with the new contract. Can he say that definitively?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	984	They referenced about a 1.8 return rate of high grade, which they normally experienced, versus a 1.2 return rate from the 1,000 slides. That is their data and I have no reason to question it. Currently, the return rate of high grade is at 1.66. A number of things were different. We have discussed the double reading and the fact that the laboratories in question know they are dealing with a population in Ireland that is screened on a three-year cycle. They have dedicated cohorts of readers who are screening Irish-originated slides. None of that was the case with those 1,000 slides.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	985	One factor suggested for the inferior detection rate and the quality of the screening was that readers in the United States were reading 80 to 90 tests daily, whereas the NHS had a maximum of 50 that readers were allowed to examine. Here in Ireland the figure was more like 30 to 35 slides. I would have thought that if a reader is looking at 90 slides each day, the possibility of making mistakes is considerably higher than if he or she is doing 30 to 35 or a maximum of 50. That was one of their concerns. Will the witnesses tell us if that continued to be the case after the contract for the screening programme was established? Is the 1.66 rate that the witnesses mentioned, which is still lower than 1.8, across the results from both the Irish and American tests? We were told that 50% are still being done in Ireland and 50% are being done in the US. When the witnesses give the figure of 1.66, is that the aggregate of both the Irish and American tests? If it is, that does not tell us specifically what detection rate is coming from the American laboratories.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	988	Will Mr. Gleeson speak on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	989	I cannot remember for the original contract that was awarded in 2008, but by 2010, and here in our quality assurance guidelines and at the quality assurance committee, the number of screens that a screener can do in one day and the number of hours in which he or she can spend in front of the microscope is the same for all laboratories. They are very consistent with what is in England and Europe.

#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	991	I thank the witnesses. The meeting is in its fifth hour and their presence is appreciated. I will start with the Department. I seek two pieces of information for the committee. One is referred to in the memorandum to the Minister, namely, the national screening services advice that Vicky Phelan's case did not concern patient safety. I understand this was an email sent on 11 April 2018. Will the committee get that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	992	It is. We will provide that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	993	For clarification, I understand that the phrase used was that it did not constitute a patient safety incident, not that it did not concern patient safety. Am I correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	994	That is correct.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	995	I do not know if Dr. Holohan was the chief medical officer at the time, but the Taoiseach referred to chief medical officer advice on disclosure. Will the committee get that written advice? The advice, as I understand it having been relayed from the Taoiseach, was that, counter-intuitively, mandatory disclosure would lead to less disclosure. I am not asking for the witnesses to relay that information now, but will the witnesses provide that to the committee?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	996	Yes, we will provide the memorandums and other material.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	997	I thank Dr. Holohan. I now return to the case of Vicky Phelan and the Department's response. Is it reasonable to say that no action was taken to prepare for the publicity and its effects as it began to unfold from late Wednesday?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	998	It is not reasonable to say that no action was taken. Swift action was taken once this became a matter of public concern and we in the Department had any sense of the nature of the issue.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	999	To clarify the question, I appreciate that action was taken when it became an issue of public concern. The Minister had been told about it ten days before it became a matter for public concern, and the Department knew about it ten days before that. It is fair to say that the system was caught completely off guard. Did the Department do anything to prepare for the potential publicity and public reaction which has ensued before it became public?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1000	We had no way of foreseeing it because we did not have information that this was related to anything other than the case. I do not want to take up the Deputy's time in giving a long-winded answer but the information we received gave us no reason to believe that there were concerns that went beyond the individual case. That has manifestly proved not to be the case and the public information that came out on the Thursday of that week made that very clear for everyone.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1001	In the conversations between the Department and the national screening service was the Department given any indication that there could be other cases like this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1002	No. There was no indication. We had no reason to believe that this was anything other than an isolated case. Again, I do not wish to be long-winded. We receive notifications, formal and otherwise, from lots of sources about individual cases. They come to the Minister; they come through the media; they come from the HSE and many other sources. Our initial focus is to try to determine first and foremost if there is a reason to believe that this leads to a concern about a service and a potential risk to people who are not yet using that service, in other words that the service is not safe. That is our primary line of questioning. That is the basis on which we would interact. Our next issue to try to satisfy is whether we have any evidence that there is a group of people who have been harmed as a result of contact with the service who now have to be identified and a lookback or something of that nature required. If we can satisfy both of those questions in the negative on the basis of the information, we would take the view that that is an issue that does not have wider patient-safety concerns. That is not in any way to take away from a view that the individual case and the case for an individual might be something of great significance.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1003	Given that that is the Department's remit, should officials not have asked if there are other cases and wider implications?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1004	Other cases-----
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1005	I am referring to cases like Vicky Phelan's or false negatives.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1006	It has come to light that there was a large number of cases where clear information that was made available by the screening service had not been relayed back to those individual patients and open disclosure had not taken place.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1007	We all know that. However, if the Department's role is to determine potential adverse future use of screening services, which is exactly what has happened, should officials not have asked the national screening service when it said: "This is Vicky Phelan's case. This is what is coming. There is an issue of a false negative. Actually it is more serious than that. It is a missed screening of cancer. The State Claims Agency say in their view there is going to be publicity around that."? I know hindsight is a wonderful thing. Should officials not have asked the national screening service if this was an isolated case or if there were other issues? Officials gave the Minister a note and therefore knew about it. The court case from the State's perspective centred on non-disclosure. Where there is potential liability to the State and it goes to the confidence of the screening service, would officials not regularly ask if it is an isolated case or if there are more? Should that question not be asked?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1008	In retrospect I would like if I was able to say that we had asked that question. That question was not asked as part of the interrogation. As the Deputy said, we are speaking with the benefit of hindsight. I gave him a sense of the primary purpose of the assurances we would give to a Minister in that situation and the role of that. I can go through that in more detail. On our index of suspicion, so to speak, regarding what has now come to pass that there was a widespread - I will not say systemic - practice whereby discordant smear test results were not being fully fed back to patients, there was nothing in that note that could reasonably be said on the basis of what it said at the time to give any reasonable index of suspicion that that was the case - that that would be a reasonable line of questioning.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1009	Does Dr. Holohan believe that the national screening service should have informed the Department because it knew this was a wider issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1010	The Deputy can ask the national screening service this. I do not know if the national screening service, itself, had a significant suspicion that this issue of open disclosure and the thing that the Deputy referenced in the note were likely to a substantial concern - that it had a substantial concern about that practice - because it did not know about it either. Events of recent days have shown that. The extent of that has only come to light through our investigations once we became aware.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1011	I know Dr. Holohan is speaking in good faith, but we have letters from the clinical director of CervicalCheck saying:"Sure, you only need to tell three of your ten patients about this." CervicalCheck not only knew this it was a wider issue, but it was actively involved in the wider issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1012	If that was the case and it had a high index of suspicion, that was not relayed to us.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1013	I thank Dr. Holohan. I turn to Dr. Henry. This is a very worrying illustration of a culture of silence. I presume he is doing a lot of thinking about this issue. Why are clinicians not disclosing information to patients, which is clearly in contravention of the HSE's open disclosure policy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1014	I have no doubt in my mind that clinicians should be aware of their duty for open disclosure and their duty to tell patients in the timeliest manner possible. It should be ingrained in their clinical practice when they are relaying good and indeed bad news every day of their lives. It should be ingrained in their training.  In this case, my reading of this looking back is that there was an audit designed for quality assurance and learning, and that the linkage between that learning and quality assurance audit to the clinicians who are treating the cervical cancer patients was never closed.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1015	When CervicalCheck finally acted, it informed the clinicians in 2016. We know that in 13 hospitals and in three out of every four patient cases, the doctors did not relay on the information. That is nothing to do with training and what one understands the purpose of an audit to be. The doctors were told of these serious incidents. They were presumably aware of the HSE's open disclosure policy. Furthermore, even if they are only acting in enlightened self-interest, the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday and again today, and the Medical Council representatives before this committee this morning, stated that the level of non-disclosure involved in these cases - I am not talking about any individual clinicians - could lead to a clinician being struck off. Given it being so contrary to a culture or at least a stated policy of open disclosure and given that it could lead to them being struck off - these are people who have dedicated their lives to saving men and women - why do they choose to put themselves at such risk and act contrary to open disclosure? What is going on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1016	I offer this by way of explanation rather than by way of excuse. In these particular circumstances, there was a dispute as to who had the responsibility to disclose this information to the patients. Did the duty lie with the programme that had collected the information about the audit or did it lie with the clinicians? That degree of disagreement can be seen coming through the correspondence the Deputy has. It was not that there was a decision not to tell. Unfortunately the discussion centred on who should tell and this was the subject of the disagreement.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1017	While I understand that, it still does not answer the question. Clearly if there was no issue; there would not have been that. The clinicians would have got the results and if they felt safe and ethically bound to tell their patient, they would have just told their patient. However, they did not do that. Clearly something is stopping the clinicians from sharing the information. It is really important that we try to understand what that is. Until we understand what that is and name it and do something about it, one of the adverse outcomes of this saga is that patients will no longer believe as a matter of default that their doctor is being fully open with them. I know I am asking the witnesses to hypothesise and speculate, but what is causing the doctors to put their patients and indeed themselves in this situation?
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1018	I might get Dr. Holohan to answer the question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1019	I will give an answer to this. There will be an investigation into those facts and how they might have played out in these cases that might help to elucidate the specifics. That goes to the heart of the question he asked earlier about the advice I gave the previous Minister for Health and now Taoiseach and gave to the current Minister which seems to be counterintuitive. The reality is that it is complex. In the minds of many medical practitioners, what plays into their decisions are fears over creating medical legal risk for themselves. This may not be the reality in terms of genuine risk, but there is a perception there. All too often when harm occurs, instead of embracing the opportunity to sit with patients and explain, sometimes the temptation on the part of practitioners is to circle the wagons, close ranks and not share information. I could give a long list of cases where that has been at the very heart of those practices. Without going into detail, the purpose ultimately of what is in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is to essentially offer protections to doctors and standards on open disclosure, effectively saying that if they do it in the right way, these protections will be offered to them. That allows us to give them reassurance and say that it is a safe and worthwhile thing to do and to encourage it. There is a judgment at the heart of my advice around which is likely to be more effective, because we want to see disclosure happening in every case.We want to encourage people to do the right thing rather than require them to do something they are unwilling to do. We want doctors to do the right thing. That is a very shortened version of complex advice.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1021	May I make one small point?

I appreciate that the chief medical officer has provided the perspective of the Department, which is very welcome, but it would be useful to get the viewpoint of the HSE on that matter Dr. Holohan has expressed his view on why this culture of non-disclosure developed and is clearly extant in the HSE. What is the view of the HSE witnesses in this regard? Mr. O'Brien may have another point to make.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1023	I was going to make an end point. Perhaps Dr. Henry will reply to Deputy Donnelly's question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1024	The duty of open disclosure should supersede all other concerns. Medical practitioners have historically feared the consequences of full open disclosure, as has been outlined. The more protection that is afforded, the easier it will be to create an environment where doctors can discuss all outcomes, including adverse outcomes, directly and confidentially with patients, which is what we want to have in every clinical scenario in this country.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1025	Legal liability is a concern for doctors.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1026	As outlined by Dr. Holohan, it is one of the fears that has fed into people's psyche. As I unequivocally stated, the duty of open disclosure should supersede all other concerns.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1027	To be fair to the clinicians involved and for the avoidance of any doubt, fault for the failure or bad news that was communicated could not have been attributed to the clinicians who were asked to communicate it because it did not relate to anything they or their practice had done, but rather to a cytology issue.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1028	That makes it even more surprising that they did not pass on the information.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1029	It does.

It feels like we have been here for 20 hours. I thank all the witnesses for remaining with us this evening. The committee members are aware that the meeting has been prolonged but we have questions which must be answered. Two people in this room - Dr. McKenna and Dr. Henry - received the letter from Vicky Phelan's consultant. I do not understand what happened after they received the letter, nor why it was not brought to the attention of senior management. What did they do when they read it? Its content, with which I am sure they are familiar, is astonishing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1034	I spoke to some of the clinicians and understood that a resolution as to who would inform the patient had been found at a meeting with the cytology service . I regret that I did not follow up to check on who that would be or, more importantly, that it was being done. I was led to believe that the matter had been resolved.

How high up did this go? He is a very senior person in the HSE structure and was such when he received the letter. Did he feel the need to give it to a more senior person? Did he speak to people on the same level as himself? Did he inform the Department? Were any other letters of that nature in circulation? This type of letter would cause me alarm and prompt me to take action. I do not think I would be happy to walk away and assume everything would be okay, given that the purpose of the letter was to advise that everybody in the equation was assuming that somebody else was taking action. Nobody was doing so. In the intervening time, information was being withheld from women, as per the circular that was issued. Notwithstanding that, did Dr. McKenna or Dr. Henry feel obliged to take action? With whom did Dr. Henry discuss the letter and what action did he take?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1038	My approach was not to escalate the matter automatically, but rather to ensure that those concerned resolved it such that patients would be informed. I regret that that outcome was not achieved. At the time, I believed no further actions were required by me as a clinical adviser once the clinicians had met the lead of the cervical screening programme and I had been assured that that caused a change in the communication policy and there would be further engagement on a consensus approach which would lead to patients being informed. If I had known the patients were not going to be informed, I would not have been happy.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1040	Given the roles of Dr. McKenna and Dr. Henry at the time and in light of my discussions with Dr. Henry since, my understanding is that he was asked to intervene and facilitate a resolution to what he understood to be the core problem of a disagreement on who should tell patients. I am not critical of Dr. Henry for thinking that he had done what was asked of him, which was to facilitate a resolution, as he was advised that had been resolved, although that proved not to be the case. He is not accountable for that resolution not being followed through to delivery. Those who said they had resolved it but did not deliver must be accountable for that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1042	Those who did not deliver the communication are accountable.

Is Mr. O'Brien going to say it is the fault of those who did not do their job but fail to identify those people? I am on the record as stating that the buck stops with Mr. O'Brien.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1044	Either the agreement was reached or it was not. If it was not, the person who told Dr. Henry that it had been reached is at fault. If it was reached, the problem lies with the treating clinicians who were supposed to communicate the information but did not do so.

I suspect that might have been its intention. Has Dr. McKenna or Dr. Henry been promoted since then?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1046	Dr. Henry is no longer is an adviser. He is now the first chief clinical officer of the HSE, albeit on an interim basis. That means he has considerably more authority than he did at that time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1048	I did not say that. Their evidence to the committee is that they took action based on the concerns that were raised with them.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1054	They told the committee what they did and the assurances they received which led them to believe that they were not required to take any further action.

The Taoiseach described what happened as a cock-up. Would Mr. O'Brien use that phrase to describe it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1064	It is not a phrase I would spontaneously use but I do not disagree with its use in this context.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1070	As the head of the HSE, I must recognise that those who cocked-up, to use the Taoiseach's phrase, were in the organisation but I did not personally make that cock-up so I cannot take full responsibility for it.

I am sure it is not news to him that there are people inside and outside this establishment who do not think so.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1076	That is the nature of a job like this. Everyone has an opinion on how good or badly you are doing. I respect the fact that people have those opinions.

Mr. O'Brien has advised us, notwithstanding the opinion we may or may not have on how good he is at doing his job, that he intends to devote himself and the time remaining to him to tackling this issue, let us say the latest scandal-----

This meeting was set up at very short notice. I thank the clerk for organising it and arranging for the delegates to come.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-02 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1082	I do not want to cut across the Chairman as he is bringing the meeting to a close, but I believe we have not had an opportunity to set out in broad terms some of the things we think are going to happen in the next few days. I would like to give a little more detail of what the Taoiseach was talking about this morning, although in the circumstances, I do not want to spend a long time in describing it. If we call the total 3,000 people for the purposes of discussion, whether they are part of the original 1,482 or the cohort that has to be identified, each case is to be looked at through an international process we are to establish. We have taken steps to begin to mobilise some of that expertise. It will require us to gain access to some of the slide materials from some of the laboratories. It will require us to do the data matching that was described. Any discordance, in the 208 cases we know about or any other one we might identify, will be subject to a full clinical review which will involve assessment by an international panel of experts capable of making it. It will include a review of charts and a meeting with each of the individual patients. Each individual woman who finds herself in this situation will have the question addressed as to the likelihood it has had an impact on either her treatment at the time of diagnosis or the eventual outcome. In very tragic cases where people are no longer alive, for the next of kin who will such information, it will help to address some of the questions for them. We also see some of the information in the findings of that process which will bring it to one report which will be published being made available to feed into ongoing consideration of the redress process that the Taoiseach this morning indicated that he was open to considering and to which the Government will give consideration. We are also giving further consideration - I know that the Minister has taken steps today to engage with other parties to - to the question as to what will be the most effective investigative vehicle to bring closure to some of the items of information, in particular some of the additional items that came into the public domain last evening. With the Minister amd as the director general said, we will receive receive daily reports from the head of the serious incident management team, SIMT, and Mr. Damien McCallion who will have operational responsibility. We will receive a daily report from the director general on progress in the management of everything that has been described.
