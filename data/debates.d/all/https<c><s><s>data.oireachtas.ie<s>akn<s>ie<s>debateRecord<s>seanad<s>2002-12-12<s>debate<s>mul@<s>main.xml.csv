#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Brennan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make funding available to Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, to address teacher shortages and the infrastructural work required.I have also received notice from Senator Browne on the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement regarding the restricted availability of smear kits to perform cervical smear tests in the South Eastern Health Board area.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion relating to the power of detention and re-arrest, a measure referred by the Seanad to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which is returned following discussion, without debate; No. 2, motion to refer a proposal providing for heavier penalties for specific acts against the environment, for example bad oil spills, to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government; No. 3, National Tourism Development Authority Bill, 2002 – Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage, to conclude not later than 12.30 p.m.; No. 4, Appropriation Bill, 2002 – All Stages, from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and all other Senators not to exceed six minutes and on which Members may share time; and No. 5, Appropriation Bill, 2002 – motion for earlier signature, without debate, to be taken immediately upon the conclusion of No. 4.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I cannot agree to the Order of Business this morning unless the Leader can provide time today to allow the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to make an urgent statement concerning the tragedy that occurred in the Cavan-Monaghan area in recent days. Members on both sides of the House are aware of the tragedy concerning a woman who was six months pregnant and lost her baby as a result of what would seem to be bureaucratic bungling between a number of hospitals in the region.While I am aware the Minister has launched an immediate investigation which will be carried out by the North Eastern Health Board, it would be entirely wrong for the House to adjourn today without the Minister coming here to make a statement on this important matter. It is not just important to the region, but it has significance to other hospitals throughout the country. As the Leader is aware, the Monaghan Hospital Action Group has been protesting on our doorstep for some months to highlight the difficulties concerning that hospital. It is only right that there should be a statement from either the Minister for Health and Children or one of the three Ministers of State at the Department. The Leader should allow for a debate between the Minister and a number of colleagues from all sides of the House. Unless provision is made now for such a debate, my group cannot support the Order of Business as proposed.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	My colleagues and I have no rooted objections, other than those to which we might refer individually, to the Order of Business.I wish to ask the Leader a serious question, which follows on from an issue Senator Brian Hayes raised yesterday concerning the banks. Once again the banks are not passing on last week's ECB interest rate cut of 0.5%. This is a very important issue which continues to arise. The House needs to draw attention to the ingenuity and capacity of the major banks in this country to slip some of this money into their pockets along the way. I will not belabour the point, but the ECB cuts rates to give a boost to the European economy if it is sluggish. It does not do so in order that Irish banks can put their hands in the pockets of consumers here, but this is what is happening. They are doing this in all sorts of devious ways.There has been much discussion about tax by stealth. What the banks are doing to consumers is robbery by stealth. We should debate this matter in order to highlight what is happening and put these people under extreme pressure because they will otherwise continue to act in this way for as long as they are allowed to do so. Members of the public do not realise they are being deceived. When presented with a reduction in rates, people are not aware that it is not the full reduction.Even though it is not done with any malice aforethought, we seem to be limiting debate on important issues. I do not know from where the idea to limit speaking times on the Appropriation Bill to ten minutes and six minutes comes – I presume an agreement was reached between some of the parties – but the Bill is, to put it mildly, extremely wide ranging in that it covers all categories of Government expenditure. While most Senators may be able to confine their contribution to ten minutes, it is farcical to ask one to limit one's speech to six minutes.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I support the comments of Senator Brian Hayes. The tragedy in County Monaghan is of a scale and intensity that deserves an immediate explanation. We have a flawed system of waiting for the conclusions of a detailed investigation in order to defuse the issue. We should be made aware immediately of the information the Minister and the relevant health board have to hand. If there are gaps or uncertainties, they should be teased out. The Houses of the Oireachtas should be informed immediately of all available information where circumstances such as these arise. Otherwise, it will be leaked in dribs and drabs via other agencies or family members of the poor woman in question. Without a proper process of issuing statements in the House, the position regarding public information will become much worse.On a related issue, I ask that the Minister for Education and Science come to the House to discuss in detail his apparent decision to reduce the number of special teachers in primary schools. The Department quotes figures on the percentage of primary schoolchildren receiving special education in comparison with the rest of Europe. Given that we have a higher pupil-teacher ratio in comparison with the rest of Europe, it comes as no surprise that more children here need special assistance. To cut back on the number of special teachers without addressing the fundamental problem of the pupil-teacher ratio will, therefore, make a bad situation worse.Will the Leader indicate her plans regarding No. 6, Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, 2002? This is a complex issue which should be dealt with at a reasonable and rational pace in order that Members have sufficient time to hear and reflect on the views of others.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Does the Leader agree that the Minister for Education and Science's intention is to conduct an audit and wide-ranging review of all special needs in the education system? Does she also agree that if Senators had listened to the INTO representative this morning, they would have established that ongoing consultations have taken place with the union representing teachers in the special needs area? Does she commend conducting such a review and comparative analysis with Europe? Does she further agree that we have made commendable and laudable progress in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio, particularly during the past five years?

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Leader may recall that, on the Order of Business on Tuesday, I raised the closure of Miza Ireland in Roscrea, County Tipperary, and asked her to call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to intervene urgently. I regret that she did not respond to my request and that the Tánaiste failed to intervene. I ask her to invite the Tánaiste to the House as a matter of urgency in order to outline the packages and assistance available to the workers of Miza Ireland who lost their jobs yesterday afternoon which, unfortunately, coincides with the lead-up to Christmas and outline the job creation plans, if any, she has for north Tipperary. This area has become a black spot since the closure of at least five major companies in the past 18 months, which is an outrageous record for any Government. The Minister has failed to visit County Tipperary since the first closure was announced. It is poor consolation to the workers of Miza Ireland that she is able to take a helicopter to Ballinamore, County Leitrim, to open an off-licence, yet she will not come to north Tipperary to look after the well-being of the workers.

Usually, we want them to address the House or answer questions on their recommendations. The decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that padded cells are no longer acceptable in our prisons is a huge leap forward for prisoners suffering from mental illness.

It appears there is a shocking shortfall, if not a total absence, of accident and emergency services in the county. Some well-informed medical professionals have stated this type of tragic incident could potentially occur in as many as 5% of cases.The Leader indicated either yesterday or on Tuesday that it would be necessary next week to take all Stages of some Bills on the same day. This is a most unusual practice. Will she indicate which Bills she has in mind?In view of the complex and multifaceted set of decisions due to be taken this weekend in the course of negotiations in Copenhagen on issues such as the Convention on the Future of Europe, not to mention EU membership for Turkey and Cyprus, the Rapid Reaction Force and relations with NATO, will the Leader indicate a definitive timeframe for holding a debate on Europe?

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a discussion on the situation at Monaghan hospital. As he correctly stated, people have been campaigning outside the House for a considerable length of time and, obviously, there are strong feelings in this regard. The situation, where a woman was turned away from the hospital, is quite tragic. She was having a difficult time in labour and the ambulance had to stop. The child was born alive and survived until it reached Cavan hospital, but died shortly afterwards. There was a suggestion on radio this morning that the child might have lived had it been given appropriate medical treatment. That is an appalling prospect and a cruel thing for the mother. I hope she did not hear the report. It is appropriate that we should discuss the situation.I refer to what my colleague, Senator Ryan, said about the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey. I understand the Minister is not restricting the number of special teachers but has instituted an audit. That is perfectly reasonable and more Departments should take action of this kind. We should not be afraid to face facts and the resources of the State, which are now limited, should be targeted and directed in the most appropriate—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Senator is making a speech.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Yes.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I seem to do that so easily. I apologise.I wish to say something in a non-speechifying manner about a subject that is often raised here, that is, the coverage of the House by the media. I compliment RTÉ in one sense because, in its coverage of both Houses, particularly the Seanad, it no longer just relies on sound bites and allows sufficient time for Members to develop an argument. That is a welcome development. As well as criticising the media, we should recognise when it does things for the benefit of the Seanad and the public.Having said that, the Leader and I agreed yesterday evening that we had had an excellent and significant debate on the drinks industry. It was important that coverage should have been given to the debate so that young people, adults, parents and the authorities know what is being said on these subjects in the Oireachtas, but there was not a peep about it. One journalist, who has been praised before, attempted to have material printed in the newspapers but it was excised because it is easier to include the Minister's speech. That is not acceptable. There was not a whisper on RTÉ. I said RTÉ gives good coverage and I know there are time constraints, but yesterday's was a really significant debate on important issues that affect people's lives. The health and welfare of the country were raised but there was not a peep about the debate.I happened to glance at the proceedings of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. I would not usually spend time viewing its proceedings, but they were actually superb. The contribution of Senator Callanan, in particular, was quite outstanding. It is a pity that contribution was not reported.

#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I support Senator Ross's call that the House put whatever pressure it can on the banks. The ECB has awarded a 0.5% reduction in interest rates. However, if there had been an increase, everyone in the House and elsewhere would be paying it by now. It is regrettable that the banks have not passed on the 0.5% reduction and we should put whatever pressure we can on them to ensure they do so.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Will the Leader give serious consideration to moving No. 11, motion 7, on the Order Paper from non-Government business to Government business in light of the recent budget, the cutbacks in rural and western areas and the lone furrow Senator Paddy Burke has been ploughing in regard to the Border, midland and western region? Like Senator White, I am a newcomer to the House and I do not know whether it would be possible to hear the comments of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this matter as well. When I tabled the motion, it related to the Gaeltacht region but, three months later, the situation has changed. There is a feeling of neglect in rural areas and we need a debate as a matter of urgency. Will the Leader consider my request?
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Senator Ross rightly mentioned the 0.5% reduction in ECB interest rates. On previous occasions the Oireachtas has obliged financial institutions by abolishing items such as redemption fees, which were iniquitous, and applications fees, which were unjust. Unless rates are voluntarily reduced on time, we should consider legislating so the banks pass on interest rate reductions immediately.The House should extend its thoughts to the workers of Miza. It is particularly poignant that they have lost their jobs at Christmas time. There is a guaranteed market for the product and I understand it is the overhang of a large amount debt which is causing problems for the company. Our thoughts are with the workers at this time.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Is the Senator calling for a debate?

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I am delighted to see the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, 2002, on the Order Paper and I congratulate the Leader on bringing it before the Seanad because it will receive a good initial examination here. I join Senator Feeney in saying how glad I am that padded cells are being phased out of prisons. I do not know where these prisoners will be put because there are dreadful problems in the Central Mental Hospital, but it is good that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making an effort in this regard. I congratulate the Irish Penal Reform Trust on the work it has done in this area.

I also agree with him in regard to the debate on alcohol abuse because we all know it is a serious problem. There was an informed debate here yesterday in which many Members participated. It should have been possible for the media to give some balanced coverage of that debate.I support the call for a debate on human rights. It is a pity we have to make a few rushed comments on human rights on the Order of Business. I particularly admire Senator White's tenacity in that regard. She went to Colombia, at great inconvenience to herself, and showed great courage while there. Any legislature would be delighted to have a person prepared to undertake such a mission. This is underlined by the fact former US President Carter received the Nobel peace prize, particularly for his work in the area of human rights. He was demonised for visiting Iraq and other places because it was not politically correct to do so, but he was, nonetheless, awarded the Nobel peace prize. I hope the Cathaoirleach will accommodate Senator White in arranging a debate on human rights in the near future. I would like to hear her report on the Colombia—

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Senator Brian Hayes stated he would not agree to the Order of Business unless the Minister for Health and Children came to the House to discuss the incident at Monaghan General Hospital. While I cannot get hold of him, I understand the Senator's position. It was a terrible and extremely tragic incident. The Minister has ordered an inquiry about which we will be informed as quickly as possible. I send my sympathies to the young mother who has lost her baby. It is a sad and poignant case on which all of us would like to have a debate as soon as possible.Senator Ross and others referred to banks not passing on last week's interest rate cut by the ECB. It is robbery. Usually, when banks are mentioned in this context, they are being robbed. However, they are robbing us instead of somebody robbing them. I will write to the Irish Bankers Federation later to find out how much money we, as consumers, have lost as a result of the non-implementation of the 0.5% interest rate reduction as soon as the announcement was made by the ECB. It is a considerable amount. The banks have learned nothing following the DIRT inquiry.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	71	As Senator Ross pointed out, the cut was made to boost sluggish economies in Europe and 0.5% is a considerable reduction. His point is well made and should be taken up immediately.The Senator also referred to the Appropriation Bill. While it must be passed quickly for early signature because of the measures it contains, the House always has an extended debate on it following the Christmas recess.Senator Ryan supported Senator Hayes on the Monaghan matter. He also raised the plans of the Minister for Education and Science. My understanding is the issue is, not whether teachers will be appointed, but where they will be appointed. In other words, teachers will be appointed where they are most needed and the number of appointments will not be affected. I will have the matter clarified.Senators Ryan and Henry asked about the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. Senator Henry first raised the Bill with me a few months ago. She agrees with Senator Feeney's comments on the use of padded cells and her praise for the Minister's directive about their use. I met the Minister approximately six weeks ago and told him we were keen to have the Bill initiated in the Seanad. He has agreed to our request and it is scheduled for the first week of the new session.Senator Fitzgerald correctly pointed out a review of all special needs in schools would be undertaken by the Department of Education and Science to which the Minister is committed. I do not know the reason we are afraid to debate such issues because they relate to disadvantaged young students and the more they are targeted the better. I cannot understand the reason all farmers and pupils want to be classed as disadvantaged. Surely they would like to be advantaged sometimes.I regret that I did not reply to Senator Coonan yesterday because I skipped a line on the page. Homer nods sometimes, but I regret I did not respond to him. We share his sympathy and that of Senator Hanafin regarding the farm he mentioned. He could take up the matter on the Adjournment.Senator Coghlan supported Senator Hayes on the Monaghan issue and wanted to know what Bills would be introduced in the House prior to Christmas. We are still in negotiations, which it is hoped will conclude later. However, next Tuesday all Stages of the domestic violence legislation, which will address amendments to barring orders, will be taken. The Senator's colleague, Senator Terry, has been up-front about her desire to have the legislation in place prior to Christmas. I am in negotiations on other Bills.Senator Coghlan referred to the important decisions that will be taken at the EU summit in Copenhagen and sought a debate on European issues. I hope the Cathaoirleach will call a meeting of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges because special debates on such matters can only be agreed by that committee.Senator White referred to the trial in Colombia. The House is glad she attended the trial and she was very courageous. I do not know many people who would taken off like that. The Cathaoirleach stated the Senator could raise the issue next Thursday via a written request. I am also aware she is returning to Colombia on 3 February next.Senator Norris referred to the reporting of the incident in Monaghan. When I heard the report on radio, I hoped the woman involved had not heard it because it inferred that if she had been taken somewhere other than Monaghan General Hospital, it would have made a difference. Perhaps the journalist did not intend to report the story in that way.The Senator also referred to the audit of special needs teachers. I had a discussion with him last night and agreed that the debate on alcohol abuse among young people was outstanding. There was a great deal of insight, knowledge, compassion and realism in the contributions. It was such a thorough debate that I came into the House and spoke to the Chief Whip and the Acting Chairman. I asked the Acting Chairman to adjourn the debate until after Christmas and that was done.Senator Norris also referred to RTÉ's coverage of the House. RTÉ has limited time available for "Oireachtas Report" and is doing its best. It is dipping into Seanad proceedings more than has been the case, similar to the newspapers, particularly The Irish Times. Jimmy Walsh and RTÉ do their best. However, it has occurred to me that representatives of the various groupings in the House should ask the executives in RTÉ and TV3 for a meeting in order that we can outline our concerns in that regard. That would be worthwhile. They will argue they are doing their best, but it would be no harm to meet the broadcasters formally to express our point of view.Senator Scanlon supported Senator Ross's comments on banking while Senator McHugh called for a debate on rural depopulation and decline, a matter covered by No. 11, motion No. 7, on the Order Paper. It would be a worthwhile debate.Senator Hanafin suggested that if the lending institutions do not voluntarily reduce mortgage interest rates immediately legislation should be considered to compel them to do so. The Senator also expressed regret at what is happening at Miza pharmaceutical plant in Roscrea. Senator Coonan suggested that the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment attend the House to debate the implications. I met the Tánaiste yesterday when she expressed the wish to attend the House. A debate will be arranged. I understand redundancies are under discussion in the social partnership talks.I agree with Senator Ó Murchú that the debate on alcohol consumption by young people was very fine and worthwhile. He was in the Chair for much of it. The Senator also spoke about human rights, praised Senator White's journey to Colombia and asked that the matter be addressed.Senator Feighan referred to the anger in the west about proposals to abolish the Western Development Commission. There are no such proposals. The three advisers to the Minister for Finance suggested it should be abolished but all of these matters are for review. If there is an overlapping of bureaucracies it is better to ensure that funding is maintained and better targeted.Senator Browne referred to access by the disabled to the House. I am informed that former Senator Brian Crowley had complete access to the House.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I made the point the last day that what Senator Henry had to say about golf clubs was correct. Golf clubs are one of the last bastions of chauvinism. While I agree with the Senator's sentiments, whether this is the way to deal with the problem is another question. I await with interest the reply of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue.Significantly, The New York Times had an article in its sports pages around the Saturday before last about this issue in Portmarnock Golf Club. It was the only article about anything outside the United States. I know it is a live issue in the United States itself because of controversy surrounding Augusta National golf club, where the US Masters is played. There has been considerable pressure to have that club opened up to women. Whatever about Portmarnock, Augusta has been an even greater bastion of prejudice. At one point it would not even have contemplated allowing black people through the gates, let alone women. Whether they equate the two is another matter. Tiger Woods changed a lot of that, thankfully.The amendment deals with those who are in breach of the Equal Status Act, 2000. Whether a club is in breach of the Act would have to be tested objectively and I would be interested to hear the Minister's view. It is not good enough simply for us to decide that a club or organisation is in breach. It would be wrong to deal only with one particular incident. I recognise the importance of the Irish Open golf tournament for tourism and as a vehicle for promoting the country. I was at the Breeders' Cup international race meeting in November, and I know the Minister got an opportunity there to talk on national television in the US about the benefits of the Irish racing industry and the excellent horses we had on display on the day. That went down very well in that particular area and, I am sure, nationally. I do not underestimate the capacity of these events to generate goodwill and tourism revenue.Nevertheless the central point still stands that discriminatory practices must be eliminated. If the Irish Open wanted an alternative venue it could come to Rathsallagh on the Kildare-Wicklow border, where I am happy to say my wife is the member and I am the associate.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Senator should not be happy with that either.

There is a very significant financial benefit in being an associate member. You get many of the rights without having to pay the extra cost. I ask the Minister to look very carefully at how the spirit of this amendment could be accommodated.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I remind Senators that they may speak only once to amendments on Report Stage, except the proposer of the amendment who may reply.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I welcome the Minister to the House. I am sorry in many ways that we have to discuss this amendment at all. In the Minister's previous office the Equal Status Bill was landmark legislation for which he will be honourably remembered. Many golf clubs throughout the country have acted in conformity with its provisions. When the Taoiseach opened a new clubhouse in Tipperary, for example, the club was in the process of changing its rules to accommodate the new situation.We are apt to forget the role women played in the development of golf in Ireland. Some golf clubs were founded by women. My attention was drawn to this because a relative of mine was a secretary of the Warrenpoint Golf Club. The Golfing Union of Ireland is an all-Ireland body. In some ways the golfing union was far more liberal in the first part of the 20th century than in the latter part. Golf clubs had women members and club officers and the relative to whom I refer stated in 1922 that he hoped a lady might be captain "for nowadays, young ladies are masters of hounds and why should they not also be Captains of Golf Clubs". Alas, however, in 1947, Warrenpoint, Malahide and Enniscrone were told that under rule XVI: "No Irish Golf Club, the Constitution of which, either expressly or by implication, confers on women the right to attend or vote at any annual or special general meeting of such Club shall be deemed to have a constitution approved by the Union", and were obliged to take immediate steps to exclude women. The ladies present at the club meeting "voiced their protest to this in very strong terms. In the past they had been very energetic Club supporters in all the social and sporting activities, fund-raising, arranging dances and providing teas". There is an air of "back to the future" about this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	When the Senator quotes from a book, he must give the reference.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The book is Warrenpoint Golf Club, A History 1893-1993 by Tom McAteer.Golf is a fine sport and Ireland is an ideal country for it. It has become a major part of our tourism industry. It is most regrettable that the Golfing Union of Ireland has been so backward in terms of gender equality and that there are still one or two clubs, unfortunately the most prestigious clubs, exercising what can only be described as gender apartheid. There was no justification at any stage for this type of rule, but given the social changes that have occurred – after all, there are nearly as many professional women as there are professional men – any purported rationale for the type of thinking that allowed people to become associate members only and to play only during off-peak times is long gone.It is wrong that semi-State bodies, even if Bord Fáilte is about to go out of existence, should condone lack of compliance with the law. State contracts only go to companies that are tax compliant and, as a general principle, State support should only go to clubs that comply with the equal status legislation. Members of the Seanad were the first to raise this matter and the media highlighted it, but no spokesperson on behalf of Portmarnock Golf Club has come forward to provide a justification for the policy. I do not understand how it can be consistent with the self-respect of successful, not to mention wealthy, people that they should operate according to an ethos which is so out of kilter with modern Ireland.I am not saying this amendment is the solution to the problem, but we should thank Senator Henry for tabling it. I hope the Minister will bring any and all influence to bear – it might not be a legislative matter – so the club will take steps to bring itself into line with the rest of the country and the 21st century.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Lest anybody should think I am a rampaging golfer, I do not play golf and never have done. However, I have always been committed to equality, whether in my work life, political life or social life. Women have the same, and sometimes better, mentality, agility, mental prowess, sporting skills and other qualities as men.This matter was raised first in the Seanad and among all Members there was equal disbelief that a golf club with such a glorious title and operation as the Portmarnock Golf Club should see fit to treat women differently from male members. I have received letters containing both praise and blame in respect of this matter. One is also told, from a high level, that some women members do not wish to pay the appropriate fee and are happy to be seen as damsels in distress if they can pay the lesser one. However, that is not the issue. That excuse is always put forward by the male species as a means of cloaking the issue. This is a macro principle, not the micro principle of who wants or does not want to pay the fee. It is a principle of equality.Tiger Woods's arrival on the world stage of golf has transformed the race issue, but if a club was to exclude black people from membership we would be out protesting on platforms with our banners and flags and attaching ourselves to the fashionable cause of objecting to apartheid on the basis of colour. However, there is another type of apartheid whereby women are accorded, particularly under the rules of this golf club, inferior status.I thank Senator Henry for tabling this amendment. I do not know if it is legally or correctly worded, whether it can be altered in the Seanad or how the Minister will respond to it. However, I am well aware that chauvinism is alive and well in many areas of Irish society. It is evident in political circles in general and in business circles. There is a belief that women might somehow have lost the run of themselves. They have brains, ideas and points of view. They are present, in very small numbers, in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the attitude is, "Well, is that not appropriate?"I was a teacher in the 1970s when Paddy Hillery was our EEC Commissioner. I taught in one room and a lovely man from Connemara, Pádraig Joyce, taught in the room beside me in Summerhill. We taught the same pupils. He was paid one third more than I was, even though we taught the same pupils – young women up to 18 years of age – the same curriculum with, hopefully, the same outcome. It is 25 years since that was changed. There are still many areas where equal pay is not the norm and women do not receive the same salaries for the same work. Teaching and public services were among the first sectors to be tackled when the European Union insisted on equal pay – we would probably still be waiting for our own Governments to do something. There were howls that nobody could afford this.There was also a landmark decision last year regarding women taking maternity leave – to which they were entitled – who then suffered a lack of promotional opportunities when they came back. They were deemed uncertain employees when of childbearing age because they were going off to have babies. My points may be making people uncomfortable, but they are facts of life; the facts of life are not just what one tells one's children at 11 or 12 years. They also relate to sections of society which still regard women as inferior or as not having all their faculties, which I rebut strongly and will continue to do in public and private life. There will be ribald and risqué jokes with people saying women are at it again, but I am pleased there are men as well as women here who share the views expressed today.I knew the Minister when we were both in Cabinet and we were and remain friends. However, I urge him to look at the implications of Senator Henry's amendment which she tabled in good faith, believing women should not be excluded from any area of life. Women should be able to say: "I am here and I want to be the same as you" if that "you" is a man.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I welcome the Minister and support the amendment. Much of what I wish to say has been said already. Like the Minister and other speakers, I do not play and have never played golf. I am not a member of any golf club as I do not particularly enjoy the game. However, that is neither here nor there as regardless of whether a golf club, rugby club or any other sort of club is involved, the situation in Portmarnock Golf Club should not be allowed to continue. I praise Senator Henry for this amendment. When the Irish Open Golf Championship was awarded to Portmarnock, the issue dominating headlines here and abroad was the fact that there was discrimination against women in the golf club. This cannot be allowed to continue. I understand the Taoiseach and all previous incumbents are honorary members of Portmarnock Golf Club. It is just as well none of them is a woman.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I support the amendment and reiterate the points made by Senator O'Rourke. The fact that there is a lower fee for associate membership is not the issue. If money was the issue, Senator O'Rourke would not have taught in the school in Summerhill for one third less pay than her male counterpart, which was ridiculous. The marriage bar, which was only abolished in 1975, affected people like my mother. It was a disgrace to any society to allow such a bar, which is now absolutely unthinkable. Even though there was a marriage bar in 1974, there have been recent arguments about a glass ceiling which show there has been a seismic shift in the country. This is due to the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform and successive Ministers in that Department.It is wonderful that the Seanad has given a lead with progressive equality legislation. I ask the Minister to consider the merits of Senator Henry's amendment. We must put down a marker. The Minister was responsible for the Equal Status Act, a wonderful Act, when Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and should accept the amendment, if possible.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I welcome the Minister.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I am praising the Leader. It is clear to me from every session that both sides of the House are delighted to have a Member of the calibre of Senator O'Rourke to lead the House. She does her job vigorously and makes the Seanad dynamic and exciting. I get bored if matters are not moving fast, but she sets the pace and makes them exciting.I compliment Senator Henry on tabling this amendment. The last time I met the Minister I asked him quietly to implement the 60:40 ratio for the new tourism board. That ratio is critical and part of the programme for Government. I feel strongly about this as there are as many good women out there as men for appointment to State boards. While I have been a member of boards, I also had to retire from the Office of Public Works in 1969 when I got married. I agree totally with Senator O'Rourke that only for the European Union we would still be waiting for something to happen.As I said this morning at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I find it frightening that the Dáil and Seanad do not reflect the fact that women make up half of our society. I am not used to male dominated environments and since being born have never found any opposition to me as a woman. Growing up I always believed women were better until I heard other opinions in my late twenties. We need leadership from the top and calls for more women to come forward. There is quite an aggressive and combative environment in the corridors, if not here in the Chamber.

Generally speaking, they do not have the macho style which is the traditional approach to running a business. They bring their own instinctive qualities to bear, qualities which are different from men's. In my business we were acutely conscious of having a feminine and maternal relationship with our employees. We did not get on with everyone all the time, but there was a basic difference between men's and women's approaches.There are 111 Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators but only 11 women. This saddens me. There must be leadership and women must be encouraged to participate. I support Senator Henry. The Minister should do whatever he can do to change this legislation. I ask him again to implement the 60:40 ratio for the new tourism board.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I thank Senators for their contributions. I agree with most of what has been said. It is true that there should not be discrimination against women in any form. It is also true that there should not be discrimination against women in the rules of any club. I fully concur with that.I know a good deal more about this than people might realise. My late mother, having become a member of Kerry County Council after my father's death in 1964, was involved in politics at a time when such involvement was not fashionable. Together with the wonderful former Senator and Deputy for Kerry North, Kit Ahern, she was one of only two women ever to serve as chairperson of Kerry County Council. She was also the first woman president of a chamber of commerce. I understand the position and I fully appreciate what has been said.When we introduced the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act, the linchpin of both was that there would not be discrimination on grounds of gender. That was made perfectly clear and, happily, that is the case today. It has led to a position where only two golf clubs, which is regrettable, exclude women from being members. As Senator O'Rourke so eloquently said, it is not a micro issue but a macro issue. I fully subscribe to that view.The Equal Status Act and the Employment Equality Act were both referred to the Supreme Court for examination. It was the intention that the sanction for a breach of the Equal Status Act would be more severe than it is. A breach of the Equal Status Act results in the licence of the club concerned being forfeited and the loss of its certificate of registration. It was the intention to ensure that the sanction would be more severe than that. However, this would not be constitutionally permissible on the advice which was available. That immediately creates a difficulty.It is true that, under the Equal Status Act, there is provision for an exemption from the terms of the legislation in so far as they apply to discriminating on gender or any other grounds. One of those exemptions relates to a club which is for the use of one gender. It is not a matter for me nor for anybody here to interpret the legislation; that is a matter for the courts. I could not say at this point what way such a case would go. Prima facie, there is no doubt in my mind that to exclude people from a club on the grounds of gender alone seems discriminatory. The question as to whether a court would hold that the exemption applies would be a matter for the court.The spirit of what Senator Henry has put forward must be acknowledged as being sound, sensible and proper. She acknowledged that the terminology she proposed, while well drafted, might not be a panacea. The difficulty is how to proceed from here. I asked the representatives of the members of Portmarnock Golf Club to call to see me and I had a discussion with them. I outlined to them the views expressed in this House and I also explained to them that I anticipated that a number of other high profile politicians would speak out against their practices. They understood this. I also outlined to the representatives my personal views and preferences. I made it plain to them that it would be my preference that they would lift the rule on not allowing women to be members of the club. I happily reiterate that sentiment.If we proceed with Senator Henry's amendment – she has acknowledged the difficulty in this – we would insert into legislation dealing with a national tourism authority a provision dealing with equality. Aside from the appropriateness of doing that, there is a difficulty in terms of the practicalities. If the measure was inserted into the legislation, it would mean that every time the National Tourism Development Authority was going to making a grant available, it would have to conduct inquiries as to whether the body to which or person or persons to whom it was making the grant available was guilty of discrimination. It would be virtually impossible to do so. It would be a different matter if the body, person or persons had been held to be behaving in a discriminatory manner, but everybody will immediately recognise the major problem of the National Tourism Development Authority deciding in advance of any court case whether discrimination was being practised. The National Tourism Development Authority is not a court and could not be empowered to make a decision of that sort.The next issue which arises, in the context of Senator Henry's amendment, is whether, if discrimination had occurred and had not been corrected, it would be possible to provide that the National Tourism Authority could not make a grant available. On the face of it, that seems to be possible, but a further difficulty arises in that the appropriateness of a sanction such as that has not been held to be in accord with the Constitution.During the passage of the Equal Status Act through the Dáil I remember the major difficulties that arose in relation to the sanctions and their subsequent formulation. The reason we proceeded with the sanction of forfeiting the licence was that many clubs would not be financially viable if they were to lose the licence attached to their premises. Unfortunately and even though they are a minority, there are also clubs which could survive without licences.I support the sentiments behind what had been said. The difficulty which remains is that of formulating a methodology whereby the sentiment can be expressed in legal terminology and be effective and practical. I will give further consideration to the matter. I cannot, for the reasons outlined, recommend that Senator Henry's amendment be passed, but I hasten to add that what she and Senators O'Rourke, Mansergh, Dardis, White, John Paul Phelan, McCarthy and others said in relation to this matter is perfectly sound.To be fair, it was never the intention of Bord Fáilte to fund clubs guilty of discrimination. The intention is to fund a major event, the Irish Open, in the sporting calendar. Golf earns €140 million for the economy, 406 golf courses are affiliated to the Golfing Union of Ireland, 220,000 visitors are attracted to the country to play golf and we have a higher proportion of great golf links courses than any other country in the world. The Irish Open is broadcast to 90 countries and has a cumulative television audience of 200 million. Bord Fáilte's intention was to ensure that the Irish Open would continue.It is also fair to say that we have been extremely fortunate in gaining a sponsor of the stature of Nissan Ireland for the Irish Open. I assure Senators that it was never the intention of that company to support anything other than the Irish Open. For that, I express my gratitude.It would be churlish of me were I not to acknowledge the fact that Portmarnock Golf Club opened its gates to the Irish Open and has, oddly enough, hosted the national women's championship on a number of occasions.I support the thrust of Senator Henry's amendment and I hope I have explained the position sufficiently. If I have not, it is because I cannot put it any better than I have.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I remind Senators that this Bill must conclude by 12.30 p.m.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not for one instant believe he approves of anything in the way of discrimination. Why in heaven's name would he have brought the Equal Status Act through the House and dealt with it with such care and consideration if he did not support it?I thank Senators for their support for this amendment. It is sad to think that Senator O'Rourke, Senator White and I have been the objects of discrimination within our lifetimes. I refer here to the fact that women were dismissed when they married – perhaps people would have preferred couples to live as partners – and the fact that we did not receive equal pay for equal work. Matters were quite straightforward in terms of obtaining equal pay for, as in my case, doctors and teachers because they could be compared. However, I recall the difficulties we experienced in obtaining equal pay for hospital cleaners whose conditions had to be compared to those of porters. This type of discriminatory behaviour continues.I do not think Bord Fáilte or Nissan realised what a mess they were getting into and the resultant publicity has not been good for either company. My concern is with the child of Bord Fáilte, the National Tourism Development Authority, rather than Portmarnock Golf Club, which has to fend for itself and do whatever it believes is right and just. It was more in the spirit of what Senator Mansergh said about the fact that Departments and semi-State bodies can only deal with firms that are tax compliant. We should try to insist that semi-State bodies should only deal with organisations and people who operate within the spirit of the law.It should be remembered that women pay a large amount of tax. I welcomed the introduction of tax individualisation by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because I had been paying tax at the top rate for all my married life. Women pay a great deal of tax and will support this new authority financially. I would have liked to have thought that we could have included a clause stating that the authority would be obliged to take into account the Equal Status Act.I accept the points the Minister made and his commitment to re-examine the position. The issue has had a good airing and I thank Senators and the Minister for what they said.

In page 18, line 17, after "Oireachtas", to insert "and shall at the same time cause the report to be published by electronic means".I welcome the Minister back to the House for Report Stage. We have taken up quite an amount of his time. We tabled the amendment on Committee Stage and had a good debate on it then. For that reason, there is probably no need to go over it again.I will repeat one aspect of the debate on which Senator Ryan spoke well when he said that, when the Gutenberg press first appeared in the 15th century, there were probably people at the time who said there was no need to have something printed because it might not last, catch on or be efficient. There is little doubt that the benefits of electronic means of communication are so strong, beneficial, transparent and useful, particularly in terms of speed and cost, that there is no way an organisation should not publish its reports and other details in electronic form. The vast majority of information we receive comes in electronic form and arrives long before we receive letters or phone calls.I criticised Bord Fáilte for not printing its report, but the Minister corrected me. I was looking for it in the wrong place. I hope the board manages to help some of the amateurs seeking its report to find it in future. It is essential that the reports be published by electronic means.I have tabled amendments similar to that before us for some years and they are gradually being accepted. However, there is a difference between compelling and enabling and I do not seek an enabling provision. I know organisations are allowed to publish a report by electronic means. I want to compel them to ensure that a person in another part of the country or the world does not have to buy the report, request its delivery in writing or look for it and that all he or she has to do is press a button and, in the comfort of his or her home in America or Australia, obtain the details. I urge the Minister to consider this again and hope he has had an opportunity to do so since Committee Stage.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I second the amendment. It is important that we do this given that the report should be seen internationally. It is not just for local consumption.

I will request the officials to see if we can find a wording which will encompass the amendment. We will then table the new amendment for consideration in the Dáil. What the Senator says makes sense.

The amendment makes sense and we will try to word it in such a way that it can be incorporated in the Bill.

In page 19, to delete lines 42 to 45.I know the Minister is in a good humour and is accepting all amendments tabled by me. I assume he will respond in the same way to this amendment. We had a good debate on this topic on Committee Stage, as we have had on a number of other occasions. In one such debate, Senator O'Toole in an impassioned plea – far more impassioned than I can be – managed to convince the Minister to accept it.The existing wording is quite frightening. On Committee Stage I said the words reminded me of Stalinist Russia. The Bill states:In the performance of his or her duties under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.I do not believe such words are used in any Bill now coming through the Oireachtas. The provision is so extreme it is tantamount to a dictatorship of the mind.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	116	On Committee Stage the Minister explained why it was introduced in the past, saying it was not right to have a civil servant criticise the policy of the Government. I can understand that. In the 1920s and 1930s when Bord na Móna, the ESB and other State-sponsored companies – this is a more correct term than semi-State companies – were being set up the Government decided to appoint independent boards. There were very strict rules and regulations governing what they could do. This was to give them the flexibility to pick their own management teams, take risks and chances, and go into the commercial world. This is particularly necessary in the case of a tourism authority, which has to compete with every other country in the world to convince people that ours is a more attractive place to visit.We now put a provision in the Bill saying the chief executive, when questioned on certain areas, must not comment or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy. That is so extreme that if we wished to make sure that no Minister or Government policy were ever criticised, we would be much wiser not to have an independent authority and rather leave it in the hands of the civil servants. Civil servants are there to put into operation the views of the Minister. I urge the Minister to reconsider this.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I second the amendment. The section is very politically correct in referring to "the chief executive officer in the performance of his or her duties", which I am very glad to see. However, we will not get value for money from a chief executive officer whose hands are so tied that when speaking before the Committee on Public Accounts, he or she is not even in a position to expound on the merits of the policy the Minister is bringing forward.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I support my colleagues in this important matter, which relates to the freedom of speech and efficiency of the person involved. In case the Minister is worried about creating a precedent, let me assure him that he is not. When this same section appeared in the Competition Bill, I objected to it and the Minister took it out. The Minister will not do any great damage or create a precedent by taking it out of this Bill. I am amazed it has surfaced again after we removed it from the Competition Bill. There is some little gnome in an office somewhere putting these things back in all the time. Could the Minister refer him for re-employment in Santa Claus's cave?
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I support the spirit of this amendment. Some minutes ago we debated the merits of equality. One of the fundamentals of social justice and equality is freedom of expression, particularly in this context. What would happen if a civil servant had an opinion that was more pertinent, effective and constructive than that of the Minister and there was no modus operandi on the part of the civil servant to disagree? Senator Mansergh will probably have a more specialist and professional opinion in this regard, if this House allows him to express it.It is akin to a dictatorship of the mind, when we are in effect muzzling somebody to prevent the expression of an opinion. Having just debated at length the issue of equality, with very worthy contributions from all Members, we should not then reject an amendment which protects somebody's right to express an opinion.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	120	There is a balance to be struck here. I am not sure I really agree with either extreme. A board chairman appointed by a previous Government could start to adopt a very political role in opposing the Government policy, which would be undesirable. However, there should be reasonable freedom as shown, for example, by the chairman of the IDA during the debate on the Nice Treaty. He clearly had something important to contribute and it was right he did so. It is a reasonable requirement that the chairman of a State body should not act in an overtly or even covertly political way.It is legitimate to bring important considerations to Government, even if they are not necessarily fully defined by Government policy. My concern is with the way it is drafted. It is a throwback to a more authoritarian culture, which, I am glad to say, has largely gone from the public service in recent years.The Taoiseach permitted me, as a special adviser, to make considered contributions to public debate. They were not at variance with Government policy, but some of them might have strayed into areas where Government policy had not yet been defined.Without necessarily agreeing with the amendment, the Minister should look at the rather draconian wording. The way the Bill is worded uses a sledgehammer to batter a nut. However, I am not saying it is covering something on which there could never be any possible concerns. Although I do not want to define the particular area, I have experience of an individual in charge of a public authority who uses it systematically in a very political and confrontational way. That is quite wrong and the Minister has a valid point in that regard.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	121	To a large extent this amendment relates to the separation of powers. While the analogy might not be entirely appropriate, I recall a story. On one famous occasion when President Jefferson did not like a judgment of the great chief justice, John Marshall, when explaining the enforcing role of the president as against the judgment of the court, he said memorably: "John Marshall has given his judgment; let him now enforce it if he can."In this instance we are not speaking about the gagging of the chief executive. This provision is to ensure he or she does as he or she is supposed to do, which is to implement the policy that has been laid down. It is not the function of the chief executive to make policy. He or she is an instrument or a means of ensuring the policy is implemented. If we were to empower the chief executive to offer his or her opinion on a policy which had been set down, we would end up in an incongruous position, whereby he or she might implement a policy with which he or she had fundamentally disagreed and everybody would know. This would not be acceptable.Several other laws contain precisely the same provision as the Bill and there is, I understand, no suggestion that these should be changed. For example, legislation enacted as recently as 1997, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, states:15.–(1) A civil servant or a member of the Permanent Defence Force or the Garda Síochána shall not—(a) while giving evidence to a committee, question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy . .There are numerous other examples, including the Employment Equality Act, which we discussed earlier, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act and the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act. For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I listened very carefully to the Minister and while I understand his concerns, he did not address the kernel of the problem. He took as an example the civil servant, garda or member of the Defence Forces. This is precisely my point. Members of these groups should not criticise the Government, nor question the merits of policy, as they are servants of the Government, in contrast to members of an independent body.The Bill establishes an authority and gives it independence in implementing policy. Senator Mansergh pointed out that the chairman of the authority could have been appointed by a previous Administration. However, according to the legislation, the chairman has every right to question the merits of policy; it is the chief executive who may not do so.I do not accept the Minister's point. If an executive of a company of which I was chairman decided to criticise company policy, I would insist he be sacked. If the chief executive of the State company of which I was chairman had questioned the instructions he received from the board or criticised the Government, we would have sacked him and if the Government had not accepted his sacking, the board, like any logical board, would have resigned. Many steps can be taken in such circumstances.The provision sets a dangerous precedent. The Minister quoted several other cases, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act. As the provision appears innocuous and features on page 29 of the Bill, it is possible that similar provisions could have slipped through on other occasions. However, on discovering this clause in the Competition Bill, Senators Norris and O'Toole succeeded in having it withdrawn. Senator O'Toole recorded a similar success during the debate on another Bill.While the provision should and does apply to civil servants, it should not apply to independent boards. We establish these new authorities so that they can act independently and according to what they perceive to be best. However, they do so within the constraints established by the Houses.Judging by the remarks made by Senator Mansergh, it is likely the Minister will consider changing the wording of this provision in future to improve the legislation. I am disappointed he will not accept the amendment and hope he will reconsider his position. On the basis that he has been generous in accepting other amendments, I will withdraw the amendment and not press a vote.

While I was not here for much of the debate, I followed it on the monitor. I understand the Bill will now proceed to the Dáil. I ask the Minister to reconsider one or two points, particularly with regard to the representation of women.

The danger is that the Government will not be aware that a chief executive is implementing policy with which he does not agree. This is a corrosive and corrupting feature of the public service.I hope the spirit of generosity the Minister has shown during the passage of the Bill will prevail and he will accept the amendments tabled by some of my colleagues. It is better to know somebody is disagreeing with one's policy because he or she could implement it in a half-hearted manner or resort to "Yes, Minister" type tactics. I would much prefer to know if my chief executive had problems. One listens if they are reasonable and fires them, as Senator Feargal Quinn said, if they are not.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on the Appropriation Bill, 2002. As Members are aware, the core purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services, both current and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.The Appropriation Bill, 2002 appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule for the year ending 31 December 2002 the net sum of €29,341,108,000. The total amount comprises: the original net Estimates of €28,844,853,000 as approved by the Dáil prior to the summer recess and the net Supplementary Estimates totalling €496,255,000 which have been approved by the Dáil. The Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts amounting to €2,481,119,000 as appropriations-in-aid of the services listed in the Schedule. As I mentioned, the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates included in the Schedule to the Bill have been approved by the Dáil. The Bill seeks to give them formal legal effect.The Supplementary Estimates do not convey the full story in relation to expenditure trends in 2002. It is anticipated that the additional pressures reflected in the Supplementary Estimates will be offset by savings elsewhere across the Votes. The recently published White Paper included a forecast outturn for 2002 which indicates that spending this year will be on or close to the target set. The provisional end-year outturn will be published as part of the end-year Exchequer statement on 2 January next.The Bill also provides an opportunity to review the budgetary and economic position which I am happy to take today. The Government and the previous coalition has had an excellent track record overall in terms of ensuring public spending each year is managed within the approved allocation for the year. Between 1997 and 2001 the average variation between the level of spending planned in the revised Estimates volume and the end-year outturn was less than 1%.The recently published abridged Estimates volume for 2003 and last week's budget have been framed in very different circumstances from those of previous years. Members will be aware that on budget day last year the projections for 2003 and 2004 signalled projected deficits for each of those years. Since this time last year the situation has become more difficult because of the unexpected continued weakness of the international economy. While Ireland may be an island geographically, it is certainly not an island in the economic sense. We live in a small open economy and cannot avoid the effects of the slowdown in world economic growth. The challenge, therefore, for us is to see what steps we can take to place ourselves in the best position to benefit from the international economic upturn when that occurs. The first priority is to get back to a sustainable rate of spending growth in order that it is more in line with available revenues. This does not mean a reduction in absolute levels of spending nor does it mean a low level of public spending given the levels of increase in recent years. However, it requires difficult decisions if we are to protect and maintain the economic gains we have made in recent years.The recent budget measures announced will promote social well-being in society. The budget measures will enable continued economic progress by further developing our infrastructure, promoting equity in society and helping protect the weaker sections within it.I will now briefly outline some of the detail of the Bill. Section 1 gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services, including all Supplementary Estimates approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. The Dáil approved the original 2002 Estimates for departmental expenditure which totalled €28.8 billion prior to the summer recess. Since then it has approved a number of Supplementary Estimates for various Departments totalling €496 million. This extra amount brings the net total grant for supply services expenditure in 2002 to over €29 billion or nearly €32 billion in gross voted spending. Section 1(1) appropriates this total net amount of €29.3 billion to the various supply services for Departments and Offices as listed in the Schedule. In addition, section 1(2) provides for the application of a total amount of €2.48 billion in departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the grants for the supply services of those Departments and Offices.I will now outline the main factors which have given rise to the additional expenditure and the requirement for the Supplementary Estimates this year. The total amount of €496 million can be broken down as follows: health and children –€210 million; transport –€100 million; education and science –€91 million; justice, equality and law reform –€28 million; and other sectors –€67 million. The areas of health, transport and education account for €401 million or 80% of the total amount of the Supplementary Estimates.The following are the main factors giving rise to the extra allocations in these areas. In the area of health and children, the net additional cash requirement is €210 million, including a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid of €41 million. The gross additional spending requirement is €169 million, of which €12 million is for capital and €157 million for current spending.There is inevitably a degree of uncertainty in forecasting the actual costs of demand-led schemes and, therefore, the original Estimates may not provide fully for these costs. This year an additional €183 million is required for these schemes. The cost of the general medical services scheme has risen significantly in the current year. Increased costs are arising as a result of a number of factors, including the decision to grant medical cards to the over 70s and some inaccuracies in the databases in relation to cardholders. The rising cost of drugs within the GMS scheme is also having a significant impact.An additional sum of €10 million is required for compensation payments and legal costs associated with the compensation tribunal to compensate persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of anti-D blood products. In addition, funding of €8 million is required under the heading of community drugs schemes.Allowing for offsetting savings and corrective measures in relation to health spending taken earlier this year, there is a net requirement of €157 million in respect of current expenditure. In relation to capital expenditure, allowing for savings elsewhere, a total of €12 million is required for amalgamation works at Cork University Hospital and refurbishment works at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.The Vote for the new Department of Transport requires a net Supplementary Estimate of €100 million. The gross requirement was €126 million which was offset by savings of €26 million. The main item is significant additional funding on road maintenance and improvement. The Government has devoted considerable resources to the national roads programme with investment of approximately €2.62 billion over the period 2000-02. The unprecedented level of activity has resulted in higher than anticipated levels of expenditure in 2002 which has necessitated a Supplementary Estimate this year of €125 million in respect of grants payable to the National Roads Authority. The bulk of the additional expenditure arises on schemes in progress or now completed and public-private partnership schemes at tender stage.With regard to the Department of Education and Science group of Votes, substantive Supplementary Estimates for the first and second level education Votes and a token Supplementary Estimate for the third level Vote are required in 2002. The net amounts sought for each Vote are as follows: Vote 27, first level education –€47 million and Vote 28, second and further level education –€44 million. The total required is €91 million.These Supplementary Estimates arise mainly for the following reasons. An additional €12 million is required to pay for additional resource teachers and part-time teaching hours for children with special needs. An additional €16 million is required to provide for the salaries of full-time special needs assistants employed in the primary system to support children with disabilities.An additional €19 million is sought for the capital funding of primary schools. This sum is needed to continue the process of addressing substandard accommodation in primary schools. The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has commenced and consolidate the substantial progress made to ensure the needs of schools throughout the State are met over time.With regard to second level and further education, a Supplementary Estimate of €44 million for Vote 28 is required because receipts from the European Social Fund projected to be received by the Department of Education and Science as appropriations-in-aid in 2002 are lower than that provided for in the original 2002 Estimates. Vote 29, third level and further education, requires a token Supplementary Estimate amount of €1,000.An additional €600,000 is required to meet extra expenditure incurred by the Dublin Dental Hospital in respect of pay and superannuation. Government accounting regulations require that a technical Supplementary Estimate be sought for any additional amount, even though there are sufficient savings on other subheads within the Vote to meet the extra expenditure.An additional €28 million was allocated to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as follows: €8 million to the Garda Vote, which is being funded by savings from the departmental Vote, and €20 million to the prisons Vote relating to pressures on overtime. In 2002 the cost of overtime was almost 30% of overall pay costs for the service. Existing agreed staffing arrangements mean that, in particular, it has been necessary to resort to overtime working to cover prisoner escorts, staff leave, staff training, sick absences and staff shortfalls.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made the continuing level of prison overtime a top priority issue for his Department. Officials of the Prison Service have been engaged in a detailed exploration of alternative working arrangements for the operation of prisons and places of detention and are finalising the details of a draft package or framework of proposals for such change on which to consult with the staff side. While it is intended that there will be an impact from the implementation of the package of measures in 2003, much will depend on the pace of the negotiations with staff interests.With regard to the courts Vote, a Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 was introduced to allow the transfer of additional appropriations-in-aid receipts to expenditure subheads. A Supplementary Estimate of €15 million was provided for the Department of Agriculture and Food to compensate for a shortfall in EU Structural Funds.Net additional funds of €107,000 were approved for the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament. The need for a Supplementary Estimate arose in respect of the legal and other expenses relating to the sub-committees of inquiry into the Abbeylara incident and the mini-CTC contract and the higher than anticipated number of former Members not returned following the general election. This led to the payment of severance and termination payments and pension liabilities.The Central Statistics Office was granted an additional €1.1 million. This sum was made up as follows: €714,000 arose due to a shortfall in the appropriations-in-aid subhead while €387,000 arose in an administrative budget subhead relating to expenditure on the census of population 2002.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment required a sum of €12.5 million to provide Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta with the funds which the two shareholders in Irish Fertiliser Industries, namely, ICI and the State, acting through NET, have agreed to provide for ex gratia severance payments to former IFI workers.A Supplementary Estimate of €30 million was required for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. A sum of €20 million was granted to provide financial support for the GAA and the FAI in respect of specific capital developments. An additional sum of €3 million was granted to enable the Irish Sports Council to provide financial support for the IRFU towards the development of rugby and €7 million was granted to provide for commitments to the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown, which will be completed in time for the 2003 Special Olympic World Summer Games. Supplementary Estimates of €8.5 million were provided for the Office of Public Works for humanitarian aid for victims of severe flooding.I refer to section 2. Article 17.1.2º of the Constitution requires that the Financial Resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that year, that is, by 31 December 2002 in the case of the Financial Resolutions passed on budget night, 4 December 2002. However, the Article also allows for the end-year deadline to be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of that year, in this case, before 31 December 2002. The section makes provision for this deferment to be invoked. This provision will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law, that is, 84 days for completion of Second Stage and four months for enactment of the Finance Bill. Identical provisions have been included since the 1997 Appropriation Act.In commending the Bill to the House I reiterate that the level of funding provided by the Government in 2002 builds on significant investments made since 1997. This is indicative of the Government delivering on its commitment to improve priority public services and invest resources wisely.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the Minister of State. The convention is that the Appropriation Bill is nodded through the Dáil and debated in the Seanad, but a debate is needed this year more than ever on the state of the public finances and the expenditure of public funds over the past 12 months. That is the reason I am glad we have a brief opportunity to debate the legislation. It should have been entitled the Misappropriation Bill, 2002, because the economic performance of the Government and its predecessor is ample testimony to the misappropriation of public funds in recent years.Last year's Bill appropriated a sum of £25,855,285,000 and while this year's will appropriate €29,341,108,000. This represents a whopping increase of €3,486 million or 5% on last year's figure. Last year in his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, acknowledged that current spending during his terms of office had increased by 79%. What an admission from a Minister who on taking office stated there would be a rigid cap on public expenditure, an increase of not more than 2% above inflation, yet after five years expenditure had increased by 79%.Instead of acknowledging that his target was not valid, the Minister made absolutely no apology for the massive escalation in the expenditure of public finances and, instead of putting on the brakes, he indulged in a reckless spending spree, squandering a €4.8 billion surplus and plunging us into deficit budgeting, like the old days. However, 2001 was an election year and it was a case of power at all costs, irrespective of what damage would be done to the public finances.This was done by a Minister who earned universal praise in the late 1970s and early 1980s for courageously standing up to the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, following his famous belt tightening television address to the nation in which he preached the need for fiscal rectitude and so on. Mr. Haughey was taken on by the Minister, then a Government backbencher, and told this could not happen. He won universal praise but what a shameless capitulation and betrayal by the Minister who set out his stall last week as a pioneer of fiscal rectitude.Last year two reasons were advanced for the escalation in public expenditure, one of which was domestic and the other international. The domestic reason was the impact of the restrictions imposed as a result of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, especially in the food, tourism and transport sectors. That excuse no longer pertains. The foot and mouth disease crisis was thankfully brought to a successful conclusion in 2001 and I commend the Minister for Agriculture and Food for that. The international factor was the events of 11 September. While it continues to overhang, its impact is nothing like as severe as it was last year.It has been repeatedly said and agreed by international commentators that the real reason for the crisis in the public finances is mismanagement by the Minister. In the debate on the Budget Statement I said the economy is fundamentally sound. The nuts and bolts are in good order. The mismanagement of the public finance has created the present crisis.The shock that greeted the publication of the Book of Estimates served as a late reminder to the public of the pup sold to it by the Government in the run-up to the general election. During the three week election campaign the Minister and his colleagues repeatedly assured the media and the electorate at their daily press conferences that there would be no cuts or tax increases and that the public finances were in good order. The reality broke with the publication of the Book of Estimates. The public saw that the Government commitments, given so loquaciously during the election campaign, were in shreds.Capital investment in education is to be cut by 4% at primary level, 10% at secondary level and a massive 29% at third level. When a Government starts to cut spending in education it cuts the legs from under one of the pillars on which the Celtic tiger was constructed. In previous times, when the economy was in bad shape, we prided ourselves on increasing expenditure in education. It paid a rich dividend. We gave people an opportunity to travel abroad and secure a decent living in the international marketplace.Jobs sponsored by FÁS and in the public service are to be cut by 5,000. Enterprise Ireland grants are to be cut by 38% and the first-time buyer's grant is abolished. The Minister of State referred to the additional cost of extending medical card provision to those aged over 70 years. There was no mention of the unequivocal commitment that in its first year in office the Government would provide an additional 200,000 medical cards. Grants to Bord Fáilte have also been cut.Over the past couple of months there have been, in effect, five budgets. The first occurred on the eve of the publication of the Book of Estimates when the threshold for the drugs refund scheme was increased from €65 to €70 per month. The second was the Book of Estimates and the third was the Budget Statement on the 4 December. Despite the pledge that there would be no increases in taxation, the 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT will badly affect first-time buyers, who have already lost their grant and will now have to pay up to €6,000 more for a house. The €10 increase in the old age pension will be wiped out by the additional cost of fuel, electricity and transport. The 10% increase in social welfare payments will be reduced by the projected inflation rate of 6%. It will erode the living standards of the poorest sectors of the community.The fourth budget, the 12% increase in road tax, was introduced by stealth last week. This is an addition to the increase in excise duty on diesel and other motor components. The fifth budget was introduced yesterday in the form of the increase in the television licence fee for RTÉ.The economy is in good order but it is beginning to slip. The Minister of State referred to the compensation payments to the IFI workers. They were dumped on the dole overnight without warning because of the failure to negotiate a deal with An Bord Gáis. The announcement yesterday of the loss of 250 jobs in Roscrea at Miza pharmaceuticals will mean a loss of €10 million per annum to the economy of the Roscrea area.The budget and the Estimates are very damaging. They will contract the economy, increase costs and make us less competitive. They will also jeopardise benchmarking and make a new national partnership agreement, crucial to the well-being of the economy, almost impossible to achieve. The Fianna Fáil Party slogan during the general election campaign read, "A lot done, more to do". The verdict is that a lot of damage has been done and there is a lot more damage to do.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I welcome the opportunity to debate vigorously with Senator Higgins the state of the public finance. The Appropriation Bill is formal legislation which provides legal authority for spending during the year, not only the original Estimates but also the Supplementary Estimates. Referring to a Supplementary Estimate of €500 million, the Minister of State said this is a gross rather than a net figure and the expectation of the Minister and the Department is that spending will be on target. That is a good achievement in a general election year. It defies the predictions of the political and media critics. Senator Higgins referred to the Minister's earlier career. In the election year of 1981 public spending was considerably above target.I am pleased to see the signs that public spending is on the rails. It is not out of control, nor are the public finances in crisis. The projected borrowing requirement for 2003 is 0.7% of GDP and the debt to GDP ratio is 34%, the second lowest in the European Union. We need a sense of perspective. Despite the urgings to the Minister that he should borrow considerably more, I am pleased he is being reasonably conservative. He wants to keep the country well away from any kind of financial precipice. Nobody knows how long the difficult economic conditions will continue and it is right that great prudence is being exercised.In my capacity as an adviser I helped to formulate the financial targets set out in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997. It was stated expenditure would increase by 4%. Senator Higgins is correct, this was meant to be a 2% increase in real terms, the purpose and spirit of which was to ensure we got into surplus which we achieved beyond any of our wildest dreams. The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was not committed to getting rid of current budget deficits. Many on the Opposition benches and equally on our own were of the view that we should use the new financial freedom to tackle many of the problems facing us more speedily.There was a debate in this House last night about schools and I applauded the Opposition for bringing forward the motion. The issue of school building has a very high priority. An extra €19 million has been given since last April. There were very few voices saying the Minister should hold on to even more of the surplus of €2 billion or €3 billion. That would not have been politically reasonable.We should regard the last five years as a unique period in Irish economic history that is unlikely to repeat itself in the future. We certainly will not have 10% growth rates as we had at their peak in 2000. We introduced programmes in every area to start tackling the problems facing us. There has been talk of cutbacks in respect of which I do not wish to go over figures and percentages. Senator Higgins has acknowledged that there has been a huge increase in public expenditure. Even gross expenditure will rise next year when current expenditure will rise by nearly 9%. There are no cutbacks, just plusses and minuses, depending on what one is looking at. That is always the case. In terms of further increases, we are on a plateau and will have to mark time. That could be the case for perhaps two or three years. It is very difficult to predict the future, but, at least, we are operating at a far higher level of expenditure than in 1997.Senator Higgins raised the issue of pensions. The last Government's record was particularly good. I was glad to see that pensioners were given first priority. When Fine Gael took office after a number of years with the Labour Party and Democratic Left, there was only a 2.5% increase in pensions. I do not think the Government or the previous one deserves to be lectured on the subject. Pensioners fell back after the 1980s because there was an unwillingness to give them priority. Even today certain bodies are talking about pensioners as if they were the deserving poor and others the undeserving poor. They are, technically, attacking the priority given to pensioners. We should not apologise for giving them that priority.Because there is no increase in overall budgets in the current situation there is an opportunity to look closely at expenditure control within Departments. Inevitably, when there are rapid increases in expenditure, a little tends to be wasteful. I know of a couple of instances in the semi-State sector in recent days. It has cost €250,000 to send train drivers by taxi to Longford. This morning there was a report of a Christmas trip to New York by 24 executives. There may have been justification for some of them going, but one wonders whether as many as 24 needed to travel, even though New York is very nice in December just before Christmas. It raises the question of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General should examine State agencies and semi-State bodies as well as Departments. I am firmly convinced that there is scope for economies within budgets and without loss of service which will increase the efficiency of spend. We must avoid the use of extra bureaucrats and artificially increasing work because it creates no real saving.I support the Bill. Public confidence in the management of the economy and public finances is improving. When the Government was elected, everybody knew there were more difficult times ahead. It was elected to keep the economy on the rails. This means there must be sound public finances and the maintenance of full employment or an unemployment rate of about 5%. We must generate the resources needed for the many pressing social and infrastructural needs which I do not deny are evident. The foundation is that we keep the public finances sound. I am satisfied that after six months that is the intention of the Government.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	136	While I am reluctant to get involved in an argument with Senator Mansergh, I suppose I should. The bottom line is that the Government has not been so much responsible for financial mismanagement as cynical financial manipulation of public expenditure. What we got during the previous five years was an unreasonable constraint on spending because of the 4% target to which others referred. We should have been investing more in the circumstances. This was followed in the last two years by a splurge in spending which was entirely motivated by the point we were at in the electoral cycle. It was entirely motivated by the Government's need to spend more money so as to be re-elected. That has now been followed, in turn, by the grossest deception of all – a complete betrayal of what the Government seemed to indicate to the people during those days in May when it was re-elected.While I accept that there was, and still is, appreciation that matters were not as good as they were, there was certainly no appreciation that the Government was going to turn on its head everything it had been saying for the previous while and everything it had been doing for the previous two years. The Government has cynically manipulated the public finances. It is quite remarkable that, despite this fact, we are still not in a what one might term a crisis position. Much of the current "crisis" is of the Government's own making because of certain deliberate decisions it has taken and to which I referred during the budget debate and will not repeat now.In the short time available to me I want to talk specifically about the issue of health and the very dry issue of value for money. I was struck when reading the report from the three wise men by some of the language and analysis contained therein. I acknowledge that the terms of reference were tight and that they were asked to do a particular job by the Department of Finance. All three are ex-Department of Finance officials and come from a culture which regards public spending as not being particularly good. I doubt if they were all that upset by being asked to cut it by €900 million.Some of the detail in the report is quite insidious and pretty dangerous. In their comments on health, they state lower capital provision will reduce pressures for increased revenue spending in the medium term. To put it another way, this means that if we do not invest in beds, we will not have to pay nurses to care for the patients who might use them in a few years.In a few trite, unopposed paragraphs, these people – who clearly have the ear and no doubt the confidence of the Minister – are, in effect, overturning what we understand to be Government health policy. Eighteen months ago, the Government made much of a document entitled "Equality and Fairness", at which I looked again this morning and which is a decent attempt by the Department at assessing the needs in terms of public expenditure and investment in the health service for the next ten years. This document sets out in substantial terms what it regards as being the needs – in terms of extra beds, manpower, day places, rehabilitation facilities, etc. – for the next ten years and then states it will cost £10 billion to meet those needs.What I am getting at here is that the Department of Health and Children, no doubt with the political imprimatur of the Taoiseach and, albeit it reluctantly given, that of the Department of Finance, compiles many wonderful reports. For example, there is a report on primary care, entitled “Acute Hospital Bed Capacity” and another which deals with medical manpower and produces a plan of sorts for the next ten years which has a great deal to be said for it.The three wise men, who were appointed by and have the ear of the Minister for Finance, have now produced a report which, in two or three trite paragraphs, effectively dismisses the Department's reports and says that capital expenditure in the health services is bad because it will produce current pressures a few years down the line. The latter is self-evidently true.I am an old-fashioned tax and spend social democrat. I believe that we should tax in order to fund better public services and that much, although not all, improvement requires additional public expenditure. I am persuaded by the arguments in the health strategy, for example, that it can only be done if you spend considerably more money. I am persuaded – nobody can argue with this – that we will only get better infrastructure, whether it is roads or public transport, if we spend, by and large, a great deal more public money. I am not saying that there cannot be improvements without spending money, but there are many important improvements which will not come about unless we spend more money.There is a responsibility on people like me, who take the view I have outlined, to explain to people that spending more money means the provision of better services. To provide such services, we must change our approach to budgeting and to the evaluation of value for money within the public service. Traditionally, there has been – I think we borrowed it from the British who have, at least, being trying to move away from it – an almost exclusive focus on inputs and on money spent. For example, when the Department of Finance consults the various other Departments as part of the Estimates process, it basically says they can spend an additional 4%, 10% or whatever and there is no actual concentration on what will be obtained in return. The Department does not say that what it wants to do this year is produce 300 more beds and that this will cost a particular amount. It does the reverse and informs the Department of Health and Children, for example, that it will obtain a certain amount of money and will have to work out how many more beds it can provide on foot of this. There is no concentration on results.Other countries have the same problem and they have tried to tackle it. In Britain, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, has spent much of the past five years trying to tackle it, with mixed success. He has had some success and some failures. There is no question that a great deal of refinement is needed. Other countries such as New Zealand, in a radical way, and some of our European neighbours, in a more conservative manner, have tried to do the same. However, Ireland has not yet taken the first step.Part of the reason has to be that the Minister is inimically opposed to the whole idea of spending money if it cannot be spent in any event. That causes a problem because it means that he reacts to everything in a purely political way and there is no idea of planning ahead.It is clear that multiannual budgeting is required in certain areas. To a degree, the Department went through the exercise of trying to use multiannual budgeting for everything a number of years ago before basically abandoning the concept. In some cases it simply does not work, but there are some budgets which clearly have to be done on a multiannual basis. The budget for the roads programme immediately comes to mind. Multiannual budgeting for overseas development aid was quite successful until it was abandoned earlier this year. Health spending and improvement of health facilities is another area where multiannual budgeting is required.We need to know in advance how much we will be able to spend. The various authorities must be in a position to plan two, three or four years ahead, safe in the knowledge that they will actually have the money to spend. It is simply not sufficient, and hopelessly wasteful, to work in a stop-go fashion. We have clearly done so in respect of the roads programme and the worst possible example of the results of such a policy have become evident this year.The Department of Finance – I believe in 1997, under the then Minister, Deputy Quinn – initiated what was meant to be a rolling process of expenditure reviews, when each of the programmes of Government was meant to be considered in turn and we were meant to evaluate whether they were actually meeting the targets we had set for them. In practice, it quickly ran into the ground. Without going into detail, I and many others have come to the conclusion that one simply should not ask the Civil Service and, in particular, the Department of Finance to evaluate expenditure programmes. It is simply not possible to do this for various cultural and other reasons involving the way the Department of Finance relates with other Departments. It could not be done fairly and one would not get a reasonable result.We need a unit, possibly within the Civil Service but external to the Department of Finance, to carry out such evaluations. A unit of that kind was established to deal with EU Structural Funds and it has, broadly speaking, worked well. We need a value for money unit – it could perhaps be called a "valuation unit"– which will look at selected items of Government expenditure in an organised way to see that we are actually getting the value for money.We also need to change the Estimates process. The Minister referred to this earlier and in the debate in the Lower House. Progress will be made if we know, for example, how much money is meant to be spent. We know what is the pattern of spending over the course of a year, but the system needs to be much better than that. Before their Estimates are agreed, Ministers must come before the relevant committees of the House to indicate the purpose for which money is required. In addition, at the end of each year they should return and outline on what they spent the money in order that there is some way of assessing what we are getting in return for the monumental sums we are spending on behalf of taxpayers in any given year. Such a process does not really exist at present. The Estimates process is conducted almost entirely in private and by the time the Houses have the opportunity to consider them, the money is either totally committed or, more probably, largely spent. The exercise, therefore, becomes virtually academic and attracts little interest.We are spending a great deal of taxpayers' money. I believe we need to spend a good deal more taxpayers' money in order to improve public services. However, as a tax and spend social democrat, I acknowledge that there is an urgent need for us to improve the way in which we evaluate how money is being spent. We must ensure that it is spent in a manner which paves the way for consequent improvements in public services in the future.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Senator Mansergh's point, that it is extraordinary – particularly in light of many of the prognostications of various commentators over the year about the way it was running well ahead of estimates – that public expenditure will come in pretty much on target is well made. That is a fair achievement, given the current situation and the fact that, as Senators Higgins and Mansergh stated, that an election was held in June. At elections, politicians usually tend to be more liberal in their spending than would otherwise be the case.Since 1997 there has been a significant increase in public expenditure, across the range of Departments and public services. Much of that additional expenditure was required. Health spending has increased by in excess of 120% and education spending has increased by in excess of 70%. There have been significant increases is social welfare spending to the disadvantaged sector of the economy. There has been increased investment in infrastructure, which was badly needed as a result of the deficit in this area. Investment has increased across the board.I understand why Senator Higgins and others – who are probably haunted by the ghosts of the 1980s when the profligacy of the relevant Government doubled the national debt from £12 billion to £24 billion – are homing in on this particular topic. I support what Senator McDowell said regarding value for money. In many instances we may be getting value for money, but across a range of services we are not getting it.Anybody who has worked in the private sector will recognise that that in a large or small organisation – the larger the organisation, the more pronounced the problem – the issue of waste inextricably enters the framework of expenditure. The element of competition in the private sector forces people to address that issue from time to time.Given the significant increase in public expenditure over five years, there is now a need, as Senator McDowell suggested, to embark on a root and branch analysis of public expenditure across all areas, particularly that of current expenditure. There is also a definite need for such an analysis in the capital area. I accept, however, that matters should be much easier to resolve in this area. We need to inject competition, particularly into the area of construction and other areas, to ensure that value is obtained.Tackling current expenditure will be more difficult because of the vested interests in many areas. One would have imagined five years ago that a spending increase of 120% on health would have produced an obviously improved service, but we must concede that has not been the case. In many instances, people do not see any significant improvement, certainly nothing commensurate with the expenditure increase. We have a good health service but significant waste.The Minister of State mentioned the increased expenditure on the GMS. General practitioners got concessions they probably should not have got in negotiations. It is not just GPs, look at what consultants are earning. When we had local health committees, I recall arguing with consultants that much of their revenue arose on the public facilities they were able to utilise to generate private income and for which I contended that there should have been a charge. In many instances, I contend that the services provided by the State are the biggest contributor to their potential earnings through private fees.Money provided for local government for improved services has been used to fund salary increases, with no corresponding improvement in services to the public. Local authorities drawing up estimates will see that the increase in administration costs has been enormous and absorbed much of the increased expenditure. On transport, while canvassing during the general election I was told that authorities were making their sixth attempt at getting traffic calming measures right in one village. Costs were written off on the five previous occasions. We are looking at providing a new route from one of our major ports that will run alongside another road constructed within the last 15 years. The Moone bypass will be replicated by a new dual carriageway. While the new motorway is badly needed, it raises question marks about the logic of some of the investment decisions being made.The Government has demonstrated a capacity to manage the national debt well by establishing the National Treasury Management Agency. We now need – with some private sector input – a similar body to ensure all public expenditure, particularly current expenditure, comes under scrutiny. As I know from experience in business, no matter how efficiently any organisation is run, it is not difficult to identify savings of up to 10%. If such a process was engaged in even more forcefully across the public sector, the savings would probably be nearer 20%. That would release much needed resources to be applied more productively elsewhere. I hope the Government will prioritise this process in the coming year to ensure the significant amount of taxpayer's money rightly invested in public services will yield the best return.

While it deals with very dry stuff, it must be dealt with to give statutory authority to the appropriations voted on. I thank all those who have contributed on both sides of the House. The common sense shown and civility of the contributions in this House stand in contrast to some of what I have experienced in the other House.

Senator Higgins referred to misappropriation. I am very proud, however, to be part of a Government and a Department of Finance that has spent €29 billion in the last year. In spite of this, we should take note of common sense points about getting value for money, an absolute priority of every Minister and Department.There has been much hype all year about spending being out of control. The Government budgeted for a 14% expenditure increase and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said all along, to the disbelief of the Opposition, that he would stay within budget. The actual overspend in the Estimates is 1.7%. This does not take into account savings that accrued across Departments. When included, the overspend is a mere 0.2%. It would be very difficult to achieve greater accuracy, particularly given the pressure to fund demand-led schemes. The bulk of extra expenditure was incurred in the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.I recently brought my own Supplementary Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament before the Committee of Public Accounts. One of the headings under which there was extra expenditure was severance and termination payments. I am thankful that the Department of Finance was not entirely accurate in predicting the outcome of the general election. It predicted an average turnover for both Deputies and Senators. In fact, we have 55 new Deputies. As 55 Deputies either moved to this House or left altogether, termination and pension liabilities, therefore, increased. I think we have 35 new Senators, ten of whom moved across from Dáil Éireann. That is one area where the Department did not quite match its financial expertise. I probably would not have featured in its reckoning.Further debates on the budget will take place in the other House tonight. Going forward we must tailor our expectations to the tighter economic situation being experienced both here and globally. There has been much criticism of cuts made in the budget, but the Opposition has been very slow in saying where the Government should have made cuts. Very difficult and courageous decisions were taken, from some of which I have suffered in terms of running my Department. Despite the intense paring of the Office of Public Works's budget by the three wise men and my Department, I had to find an extra €5 million for humanitarian aid to deal with the fall-out from the recent floods and it may not stop at that. All this must be taken account. It is impossible to budget in advance for floods or humanitarian aid.I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate and I am happy that my Department has been as accurate as possible in terms of the appropriations, Estimates and savings made. Clearly, the savings made cannot be included in the Estimates, but we are reaching our target. At the end of the year we will be as near as makes no difference to the target set out. It must be difficult for anybody to find fault with this.

Everybody acknowledges the tremendous contribution the college has made in training primary school teachers over the past 100 years. It has increased its student numbers from 600 in 1992 to 2,300 at present. This has been done at the request of the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority in order to tackle the shortage of primary school teachers. However, the increase has been implemented without a corresponding growth in facilities at the college and the extra students are using substandard facilities.The last custom-built building was erected in Mary Immaculate College in 1979. A massive plan for the college's development, as part of the national development plan, has been submitted to the Department. I ask the Minister to ensure that the physical education teaching building proceed on the agreed schedule, with building commencing in spring 2003, that the infrastructural works required for the building development programme be progressed as scheduled, that advance design work on the three building phase of the college proceed as planned and that such work be brought to tender stage in readiness for immediate activation when further funding becomes available to carry out construction work.

Its response to the demand for additional primary teaching places is commendable with numbers increasing from approximately 850 in 1998-99 to over 1,400 at present. The Department acknowledges the need for infrastructural development at the college.A masterplan, which set out a framework for future development at Mary Immaculate College of Education, was completed in 2001. The Department of Education and Science concurred with the basic thrust of the masterplan and a design team was appointed for a first phase of development at the college and the initiation of architectural design, which is outlined in the Department of Education and Science design team procedures. These procedures comprise nine stages, covering architectural planning, preparation of tender documentation, tender report/contract approval, construction and final account stages.A design team has been appointed for the first phase of the development, which comprises phase 1A, 1B and 1C and the infrastructure works associated with each of these developments. Phase 1A consists of a multi-purpose teaching hall which will accommodate a number of activities including physical education teaching programmes, student examinations, conferral ceremonies and social and recreational sporting activities. The layout of the existing site is such that it is necessary to demolish the existing unsatisfactory sports building in the college to allow for development to take place.Phase 1A is the multi-purpose teaching hall, which is an essential facility for the college. Phase 1B is the new auditorium and phase 1C is the teaching space, which includes a link to the colleges existing buildings. Infrastructure works, which include the provision of a new campus entrance on to Courtbrack Avenue, new internal paths and roadways and associated parking areas together with new drainage and services are also included in the first phase of development.The design team is currently working on stages 4 and 5, which involve the detailed design and preparation of tender documentation on phase 1A. An outline sketch scheme for infrastructure works is currently under consideration in the Department of Education and Science. An outline sketch scheme is also in preparation for phases 1B and 1C.Funding has been provided to the college over the last number of years to provide temporary accommodation for the college to assist with their accommodation needs in the short term. The capital allocation in 2003 is based on legally enforceable contractual commitments approved by the Department by close of business on Thursday, 14 November 2002. Officials from the Department of Education and Science will commence, in the new year, a series of meetings with the Higher Education Authority to review the entire set of capital requirements in the third level sector with a view to re-establishing priorities and re-phasing projects in the context of future funding expectation.I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.

It takes a further four months before they obtain the results from those tests, meaning that there is an overall delay of six months. I forwarded to the Minister a copy of the letter I received from a group of doctors in Carlow outlining the case and I would appreciate a reply.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-12 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The Minister for Health and Children and I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. The Senator's concerns relate to the restricted availability of smear kits in the South Eastern Health Board area. These kits are supplied by the board to smeartakers, predominantly GPs, in order to assist them in the provision of services in the case of women who present for opportunistic cervical smear tests in the region.We raised the matter with the South Eastern Health Board, which has responsibility for the supply of such kits, and it has responded to the effect that because it has no cervical cytology laboratory, it relies on the services provided by St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar. Given the demand on services in St. Luke's Hospital, it has been unable to supply the board with the level of service necessary to meet demand and this has resulted in restrictions in relation to the availability of smear kits.The demand for smeartaking services has increased hugely in recent years. Information supplied by cervical cytology laboratories points to the annual throughput of smears increasing by approximately 24% to over 210,000 smears between 1997 and 2001. The increase is attributable to a number of factors including media interest in the area, notably the incorporation of a story-line involving cervical cancer in a popular TV programme last year. In addition, the commencement of phase one of the national cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board has also increased awareness among women outside the board's area of the importance of screening. This increase has manifested itself in particular in additional demand for cervical cytology laboratory services.With a view to facilitating boards in meeting these extra demands, additional resources have been made available over the past few years. These resources have resulted in the employment of additional staff, purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new liquid-based technology in laboratories. The funding has also facilitated the development of colposcopy clinics, to which women who require treatment following a positive smear test result are referred. An additional €1.4 million has been allocated to health boards and the ERHA for 2003 for ongoing development of the services.Cervical screening is a worthwhile preventive health measure when delivered as an organised screening programme. This was acknowledged in the 1996 report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee. That report also acknowledged that, based on an extensive literature review, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of opportunistic screening and that "it is generally agreed that opportunistic screening such as the current Irish screening service, is not effective in reducing overall mortality".Following on from the recommendations in this report, phase one of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. A key concern in relation to the development of phase one is that of ensuring a service which is underpinned by quality assurance and best practice. Under the programme, in the region of 67,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group will be screened at five yearly intervals free of charge. Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country.The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking, with significant logistical and resource implications that requires careful planning. The experience gained from phase one of the national programme should be of assistance in the context of implementing this commitment. As part of an examination of the feasibility and implications of a rollout of the national programme, I understand that the health boards executive is planning to have an external review of phase one carried out during 2003. Other issues relating to the management of the national programme, in particular in the sphere of governance, are also being examined by the chief executive officers of the health boards.The Minister and I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to address this issue.The Seanad adjourned at 2.10 p.m. until 2.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 17 December 2002.
