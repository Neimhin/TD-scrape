#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We saw the result of the first test of the EU Constitution in Spain last weekend. When will the Government set a date for the holding of a referendum to ratify the EU Constitution in Ireland? It would be useful if a date were set for the referendum early so that there is a long lead-up campaign. If there is not a long period for the dissemination of information so that voters know the issues and political parties take responsibility for explaining them on the doorsteps, the vote could go the way of the first Nice referendum. The Government would be wise to set a date early for this campaign. We could work towards it if we knew such a campaign was to take place over the next year to 15 months. That would greatly help those of us who want Ireland to vote "Yes" in the forthcoming EU constitutional debate.The Leader took the initiative some years ago to invite individual MEPs to the House at various times to take questions and generally participate in debate in the Seanad. As the Leader is aware, under Standing Orders, the House may invite the entire Irish delegation of MEPs to attend. It would be useful if, some time between now and the summer recess, we invite all the Irish MEPs to the House to debate the European Constitution——

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	5	As regards how matters are progressing in Northern Ireland, I have raised twice on recent occasions the importance of deepening cross-community involvement below political level. It is worth noting that last night the friendly football match between Linfield and Derry City passed off without any problems on the pitch. The only problems were outside. The officials of both clubs were delighted with the way it passed off on the pitch and with the importance of the event. It is an example of the type of issue that can be developed. An all-Ireland soccer league, which would be attractive if enough money was put into it, is the type of engagement we need to see taking place while there is a political lacuna of the type that exists at present.Perhaps I am the only one who gets irritated when the term "republicanism" is sullied by being confused with murderers and raving nationalists of one type or another. It is time we reclaimed republicanism.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	No republican could ever go out and shoot someone on the basis of belief. The term grew from a consideration, an agreement and a policy that Catholic, Protestant and dissenter would live together. Nowadays, that can be extended into a wider community. We should base republicanism on that view. We need to recognise that republicanism was not on one religious side or the other but it crossed from Catholicism to Presbyterianism and in between during that time. If we develop that on a first principle basis in terms of how to bring forward deeper community involvement, we might find a sense of direction which is missing from the Northern peace process at present. That is not to say that there is no need or opportunity for political involvement — of course there is — but we need to have it in the full depth of the community from here on.

Ar pléadh an tairiscint seo áit ar bith nó an bhfuilimid chun glacadh leis gan díospóireacht? Has it been discussed anywhere? If it has not been discussed at the appropriate committee, it is very bad parliamentary practice to have a motion on a democratic election before the Oireachtas without the details being discussed. We know by now that parliamentary draftsmen make mistakes. We end up being the victims of those mistakes as Parliament is blamed. If it has not been discussed and if the Leader cannot assure me that it has been discussed in some forum, I would not be agreeable to it being passed without debate.Senator O'Toole is absolutely right. There is only one political movement in this State that should not be allowed to claim the title "republican".

No political cause is so sacred that people like that can be protected. Anybody who protects someone like that is not a republican. That needs to said categorically here.I understand that we are in favour of the EU ending its embargo on the sale of arms to China. I do not know whether this has been debated somewhere, but I understood that EU policy was now more accountable to the Oireachtas. This is a fundamental decision — selling arms to a brutal regime which has perpetrated something close to genocide in Tibet. The idea that we would sell arms to them has great moral implications. We should have an opportunity to debate this before an EU decision is taken. It is perhaps the first time in my political career that I have agreed with George W. Bush about something.

It is not subject to regulation by IFSRA, even though the committee chaired by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recommended that such bodies should be regulated. I would like a Minister to come before the House and explain why the Government decided not to implement a recommendation of a committee chaired by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He is so eloquent in telling us — correctly in my view — what is wrong with these organisations. As I said in regard to another matter previously, there should be no area of financial activity in this country which is not subject to IFSRA. That is the only way to ensure justice for people and that large scale money laundering cannot take place.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I echo the calls by Senator Hayes for a debate on the referendum on the proposed EU constitution. We have learned from past mistakes that we can sometimes be complacent in the lead-up to such referenda. There is an onus on us all to ensure that the message is communicated properly to the Irish people and the House can play a positive role in doing that by facilitating such a debate. I do not think it can be early enough to start on this particular route.I fully endorse previous comments made by speakers on republicanism. President Bush may be happy that Senator Ryan agrees with him, but I am getting worried that I am now agreeing with the Senator.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	17	That is an even bigger jump.

There is an onus on us all to reflect on these issues and to ensure that we keep the peace process moving. The kernel of all these recent difficulties is that people are speaking the same language, but have a different meaning as to what is and what is not criminality. This has come very much to the fore. Statements in the other House yesterday represent an effort to clarify that issue. However, we must maintain the momentum in this regard.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	20	We welcome the McCartney sisters who are meeting the different Government parties today in Leinster House. They have been extremely brave in the circumstances. As a result of the reign of terror and fear of the IRA in Belfast, not one of the 50 people in the public house on the night of Robert McCartney's murder has yet come forward. I will believe what Deputy Ó Caoláin said in the House yesterday when I see the murderers of this person tracked down. Until then, I do not sincerely believe what he and others like him are saying.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I agree with the concept of republicanism as defined by Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan. I compliment the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the way he handled the concept of republicanism on "Questions and Answers" last Monday. He gave an outline of how we perceive republicanism, which is not the type that is being sullied at present. I am delighted to support the comments made.I raised the issue of a referendum on the European Constitution some time ago. While it is time to motivate people to discuss the proposed constitution, perhaps we should wait until after the by-elections to avoid confusing the issue. We should get one thing out of the way before we finalise and fix a date on another. Senator Brian Hayes was correct to say it is timely to use the Chamber to launch the debate and reach out to the public. It is a golden opportunity.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Will the Leader consider No. 22, motion 7, which proposes to extend the Order of Business? It is rather bad for the House that Members undermine without wishing to the authority of the Cathaoirleach because there are matters we want to raise. The Order of Business is the best attended part of the day and it is the aspect of our business to which the media pay most attention. It is very often the time at which the most interesting debate takes place. It would serve the House well to discuss whether we can change the terms under which the Cathaoirleach presides over the Order of Business to facilitate a better, more efficient debate. More time should be provided to allow every Member who wishes to speak an opportunity to do so.I share Senator Ryan's disquiet on the moves which are afoot to lift the EU embargo on the sale of arms to China. I am very sorry the Taoiseach appears to be going along with the plan. We have complained a great deal about bullying and murder by the IRA. I remember Brendan Behan saying that people complained about the small bombs of the IRA but not about nuclear bombs. We should do both and bear in mind that arms sold to China may be used against the people of Tibet who have been the subject of a continuous cultural genocide. The Chinese are driving a railway into the country and intend to flood the place. It is a disaster and instead of sending China arms, we should raise human rights issues.I join with my colleagues in saying that the McCartney sisters are women of the most extraordinary courage and dignity. Given that they were all Sinn Féin voters, their response cannot be impeached. It was chilling to hear them say they had known things before to which they turned a blind eye because such activities were part of the culture. They mentioned a rape, the use of a hot iron on a woman's breast and the fact that the thugs in the pub in question said, "Do you know who we are? We are the IRA". This is not acceptable. We owe the McCartneys a great debt for having the courage to expose this behaviour within their own tradition. As I said yesterday, this kind of thing also occurs in the Unionist community. In the absence of support for policing on both sides, it may, regrettably, continue.

I do not exclude other parties, even those of which we are severely critical, from using the word "republican" in the hope that a greater depth of understanding of the values involved will develop. Those values were summed up in the very first declaration of the Society of the United Irishmen who pledged to work for deeper constitutional knowledge, the abolition of bigotry in religion and politics and equality of representation. It is not a bad programme for republicanism even today.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Under the divorce legislation enacted in 1997, couples must live apart for four of the five preceding years before they may apply to divorce. On 1 March, an EU directive will come into force in Ireland which will allow a spouse who has been living in another jurisdiction for one year to apply for a divorce which, if granted, must be recognised in the State. More worryingly, foreign courts will for the first time be permitted to grant child custody orders to persons who have been living in another jurisdiction for one year even if the children in question have been habitually resident in Ireland. The children may be those of married or unmarried parents. The directive represents a worrying step for many people and involves very broad provisions, especially relating to children.My concern is that the issue has not been properly debated. I have not been involved in any debate on the matter, nor had I heard it mentioned before yesterday when it was brought to my attention. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to outline the impact of the directive. While the directive will, as Irish law, seriously change our divorce legislation, I am most concerned about the children who may become the subject of custody orders granted to parents living in other jurisdictions. I would like a debate as a matter of urgency.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I call to the attention of the Seanad the handwritten note of surrender of Padraig Pearse from Easter 1916 which is on display in the James Adam showrooms on St. Stephen's Green. The sale of the note will take place in May and the guide price is approximately €40,000 to €60,000. The note is a document of priceless historical value written at the time of the birth of the State. In the strongest possible terms, I implore the Government to ensure the note is purchased by the State as it belongs to the people of the State.

I recommend colleagues to visit the Adam showrooms today to look at the letter. It will be a deeply emotional experience. I would like to see the State buy the letter and display it in our wonderful museums rather than allow it to be locked away in a private home. Pearse's pain and torture are evident in the handwritten note.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I raise the plight of 40 Polish workers employed at the Dublin Port tunnel whose contracts of employment are being examined by Government labour inspectors. It appears the Polish workers earn approximately half of what their Irish counterparts receive, notwithstanding the standard wage agreed by all companies involved in the construction industry. The failure to provide the Polish workers with holiday pay or overtime would constitute a gross exploitation of any category of employee, especially given our need for non-national workers to drive the economy. The Leader recently launched at Trinity College, Dublin, a book on the plight of female migrant workers. It again highlights the abuses which take place. It is unacceptable, and I call for a Minister to come into this House and make a statement in terms of how the Government is dealing with the matter.I also subscribe to calls for a debate on the EU constitution. The constitutional treaty should be in the public domain and debated and ample information should be available to enable people make a decision. We should learn from the mistakes that were made with the first referendum on the Nice treaty. I hope that will not happen again and the Government will announce the date for the referendum so that the parties and groups involved can be up and running and the public can benefit.When will the Veterinary Practice Bill come back before this House? It came before the House in December and there was a very good debate on Second Stage. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, wanted to make a number of observations in the Bill, however, it is now almost the end of February and people are becoming anxious. I would appreciate it if the Leader could ascertain when it will return to this House.

It proposes to locate this super incinerator in the midlands. The time has come to have a debate on waste management because there are differences in Government on the issue. Both the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, gave the parliamentary party a commitment that they would bring up the matter at the next Cabinet meeting. The issue has appeared in the national media and the party is proposing one super incinerator for the country to be situated in the midlands.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I was annoyed by the comments of a Progressive Democrat from the west of Ireland who stated it should be located in an under-developed and deserted area of the midlands. This is an insult to the people of the midlands, who are represented by two Progressive Democrats members have been elected to the Oireachtas. I ask the party to withdraw those comments and apologise.

I support the call for a debate with regard to that harmful, disastrous colorant. My understanding is that it is used in over 400 products.The production of own brands must cease or, failing that, they must be governed by legislation. Traceability is of paramount importance with regard to what each of us is eating. Own products mean bland packaging and the consumer knowing nothing. One manufacturer can produce many own brands for different stores and nobody knows where anything comes from. It is important that this practice cease.I raised the issue of savings in the past couple of weeks and the Leader kindly responded. We have since read about the matter of SSIAs. The Minister for Finance made a statement a few days ago that he did not envisage any further scheme, but it is important that savings be further encouraged and that those funds be allowed into pension funds, PRSAs and whatever pension scheme a person has. That is also of paramount importance. Perhaps the Leader would use her good offices in that regard, or perhaps the Minister will be in the House shortly.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I support Senator White's call regarding historical documents which makes good sense. We should preserve historical State documents for public knowledge and scrutiny.Yesterday the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, opened a new Michael Collins museum in Cork. This is long overdue and a welcome development. It is important we recognise famous historical figures who paid dearly with their lives at a very difficult time in the foundation of State. We cannot even begin to imagine the pressure they were under 70 and 80 years ago when founding the State.Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport into the House? He is announcing allocations for this year's road building programme and it is important we have a debate on the matter next week. There is much division within the Government on the issue of a motorway for the south east and it will be interesting to see if it is included in the allocations.We also need a discussion on tolling, which will be a massive issue in the by-elections. People in Meath and Kildare North are very concerned about the Government's policy of tolling everything. The motorist is extremely hard-pressed paying motor tax, vehicle registration tax and huge petrol prices, etc. This is an opportune time for a debate on road funding and why only half the income taken in motor tax is subsequently spent on local roads.

The Spanish Government was clever to hold an immediate referendum because the new Prime Minister wished to cash in on his current popularity. His government had a good result.I raised the matter of the European agenda in this House at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. In the House I suggested that a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be held to detail how we would deal with this agenda. The Cathaoirleach agreed to that. I agree it should happen after the by-elections. We could have a meeting in the next couple of weeks. It is a good idea to have all the MEPs together because we could have a debate with them. As well as being productive it would make headlines if we got all the Irish MEPs to attend the House. That is one of the ideas, therefore, and I have sought such ideas from Members so they can be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.Senator O'Toole mentioned how important it is to deepen cross-community relationships and he said how well the match between Linfield and Derry City had gone on the pitch, if not off the pitch. He also said that the word "republicanism" is being sullied and that all the democratic parties should reclaim it as their own motto. I fully agree with that because the way in which the word "republicanism" is being cited now is both a parody and a negation of its meaning.Senator Ryan raised the issue of the Údarás na Gaeltachta elections but I have not been able to find any committee which has dealt with that matter. The regulations covering Údarás na Gaeltachta are being made to bring those elections in line with the last local and general elections. Nothing is being introduced with regard to the Údarás na Gaeltachta regulations that has not already been implemented for the last local and general elections. Nonetheless, I asked members of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, including Senator McCarthy, but nobody seems to have dealt with the issue. The regulations may well have been discussed with regard to the local elections but not the Údarás na Gaeltachta elections, which was the question raised by Senator Ryan. Is that not correct?

I may be wrong but in that confined timeframe we have been unable to find where that occurred.Senator Ryan also agreed with what we have all said about republicanism. He also expressed his agreement with the views of President Bush on the proposed EU decision to end its embargo on arms sales to China. I notice a growing affinity between Senator Ryan and others on these matters.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Senator Norris and I have agreed for a long time about this.

Senator Ryan also raised the fact that the finance company which is at the centre of the current controversy is not regulated. It is, in fact, in an unregulated financial sector, which sounds extraordinary if it is the case. The Senator says it is and from what I have read I think it is.Senator Minihan said the Seanad should facilitate a day-long debate on EU matters, including the EU constitution. Senator Brian Hayes said the Government should soon announce the date of the proposed referendum on the constitution to ensure there is a long lead-in to the debate. I do not know when it is proposed to hold the referendum.

The EU constitution is important and will bring about great changes. We should take that into account.Senator Minihan also said the ongoing debate on the North was bringing clarity to the issue of criminality. Senator Finucane said he would like to welcome the McCartney family to the House today, as we all would. The McCartney sisters are people of sterling character.Senator Ormonde and other Members agreed with the idea of having a day-long debate on European affairs and other matters. However, she thought we should wait until after the by-elections, as I think also. I welcome the support for such a European debate.Senator Norris wanted me to consider No. 22, motion 7 on the Order Paper which proposes to extend the Order of Business to 90 minutes. We will see about that. It is up to the Cathaoirleach.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	76	It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	77	It will go before the committee. Senator Norris agreed with the arms embargo issue. He also said that the McCartney family members have such dignity in stating their case. I think so, too. They never shout or scream, they just state their point of view and have stuck to it. We will all welcome them to Leinster House today.There was an altercation between Senator Mansergh and the Opposition and I expect we will have more of that later. He stated that the Fianna Fáil logo includes the words "the republican party". Other parties can also trace their origins and ethos to the republican tradition, which is a European tradition as well as being an Irish one. It stems originally from the United Irishmen. Wolfe Tone always said that Catholic, Protestant and dissenter should be united in the one cause. The wider implications of the word "republicanism" are very interesting and bear no relationship to what is currently happening all over this country.Senator Terry raised the question of divorce in the European Union. I read that report with great interest and it seems quite a startling change that divorce would be available to couples when one partner had been living in another EU member state for one year. When the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, introduced the divorce legislation I agreed with it as a Member of the Dáil at that time. I always felt that the period of fours years before one could apply for a divorce, was a cooling-off time that provided a period for reflection and mediation. Such attempts at mediation may not work out but sometimes they do. They constitute a safeguard for children so that arrangements for their welfare can be made in good time. The new proposal is rather alarming in that one partner must be resident in another European country for a year, but in these circumstances making custody orders for the children involved will be a major step. It is time for us to debate the issue in order to clarify it. The arrangements for divorce in Ireland have served the country well since the legislation was passed in 1997.I thank Senator White for raising the issue of Padraig Pearse's note which is displayed in the James Adam showrooms on St. Stephen's Green. She said it should be purchased by the State. I hope it will be. I will pass on the Senator's remarks to the relevant Minister. I do not think the note has any connection with the Lissadell estate, to which the Senator referred. That would have meant maintenance, custody, staffing and other matters that would not arise in this case.

The employer said it was all a mistake.

The Minister has had meetings with interested groups about their concerns and she hopes to take Committee Stage either next week or the following week.Senator Leyden sought a debate on food safety.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I thank the Seanad for arranging to take statements today. I welcome the opportunity to outline for Members of the House the many activities that have been undertaken to date to support the implementation of the Government's national spatial strategy.As Members will know, the national spatial strategy is a 20-year strategic planning framework designed to achieve balanced regional development by enabling every part of the country to reach its potential regardless of its size or location. The strategy has three main objectives. The first is to achieve a better spread of job opportunities and economic activity throughout the country by sustaining Dublin's role as an engine for the economy while strengthening the drawing power of other areas and to bring people, employment and services closer together in a way that sustains strong communities and strong regional economies.The second element is to improve quality of life by delivering less congestion, less long distance commuting and enhanced access to services across the whole range of public services. The third element is to create a better place to live, taking care of the environment while making the most of cities, towns and rural areas.The strategy aims to build up the strengths of all areas in order to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to promote development and growth in different areas.Earlier this month in Ennis, it was my great pleasure to launch the full set of regional planning guidelines which have been adopted by regional authorities throughout the country. This was a major milestone in the implementation of the national spatial strategy. For the first time Ireland now has in place the entire hierarchy of strategic plans envisaged under the Planning and Development Act 2000. These range from the national spatial strategy at national level to regional planning guidelines at regional level and to city, town, county and local area plans. The national spatial strategy, and the regional planning guidelines now in place to support it, recognise that the various regions of the country have different roles to play in the country's national development. Both the strategy and the guidelines seek to organise and co-ordinate these roles in a complementary way that provides enhanced opportunities and choices for people living and working throughout the country.The regional planning guidelines seek to make regions more competitive according to their strengths. They are also about ensuring a high quality urban environment as well as vibrant rural areas. Achieving the economic and social potential of our regions can only happen if the various elements in different areas, such as cities, larger and smaller towns and associated rural areas, collaborate more closely on mutually beneficial strategies for development. In the past people tended to do their own thing and we sub-optimised.With the regional planning guidelines now in place the focus will shift to the achievement of the objectives of these guidelines in the coming years. An important first step in this regard will be to translate the strategic policies of the regional planning guidelines into development plans at local authority level in order that there will be a seamless and wholly integrated architecture in which planning effectively takes place. This will ensure that the thousands of individual planning decisions we make each year are informed by the "big picture" strategic policies set out in the regional guidelines. It will also facilitate the co-ordination of substantial investment by the public and private sectors in key infrastructure.My Department has recently published Best Practice Guidance for Regional and Local Authorities on Implementing Regional Planning Guidelines. It is also my intention to publish shortly for public consultation draft guidelines for planning authorities on development plans, which will also aim to give a more strategic focus to development plans. At a micro level I am also shortly due to publish the guidelines for sustainable rural housing. When all of these plans are in place we will have an entire framework within which planning can take place from the top to the bottom.The national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines are already having a key influence on the determination of our national investment priorities and will do so to an increasing extent in the future. It is vital for regional development that in developing investment priorities we pay particular attention to the development of the gateways and hubs designated under the national spatial strategy. This will enable them to realise their potential for leading the development of their areas in partnership with other towns, villages and rural communities.My Department is currently undertaking a major study of the investment needs of gateways with the aim of identifying ways in which key enabling infrastructure can accelerate their ongoing development. A report on this matter will be submitted to Government later this year, probably in late autumn. My Department has also put a wide range of measures in place to promote levels of awareness and activity. We are actively engaging relevant Departments and other agencies in the implementation of the national spatial strategy. It is clear that all public agencies have not only to sign up, but also to participate in the process. There is already some encouraging evidence of real and concrete responses to the national spatial strategy and to the regional planning guidelines across the public and private sectors. For example, the agreement between the Department of Finance and other Departments on the multi-annual capital envelopes, which facilitate a more strategic approach to investment, require that account be taken of the need to support the implementation of the national spatial strategy in determining investment priorities. The decision to use envelopes to use the expenditure in a more flexible is a worthwhile and welcome development.I welcome in particular comments made by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in this House last week during the debate on the development of the BMW region that it will be important for the future and, in particular, post 2006, that investment choices at national and regional level take full account of the national spatial strategy framework. A consistent theme running through the regional planning guidelines is the priority placed on the overall transport investment, particularly that intended to deliver better connectivity between the regions. Today's announcement of €1.4 billion for national roads on top of the €7.8 billion which was already allocated and spent since 1997, taking into account that a further €7.7 billion has been allocated, is a good example of what is happening.In the context of our requirements for an efficient modern and effective national transport system, the initial and essential focus in national investment terms in the national development programme was on better road and trail linkages between Dublin and the main cities on the island. As these major projects progress towards conclusion, the regional planning guidelines emphasise that for the regions' economic potential to be fully realised and for wider areas to benefit from the development of gateways and hubs, the internal linkages within the regions and between the regional gateways needs to be improved substantially.The ten year transport infrastructure framework now in preparation will take account of the linkages between transport, land use and spatial planning and will be fully informed by and will support the policies set out under the national spatial strategy. One specific and significant example of central Government responding positively to the strategic planning at regional and local level was the decision to make a €90 million investment in the Mallow-Cork-Midleton commuter rail service, which will open a new 20,000 house development for Cork over the next 15 years or so. The rail investment follows through on the Cork area strategic plan and demonstrates national investment in critical infrastructure being prioritised to support new and innovative development patterns.In Dublin, the new Dublin city development plan, taking its lead from the development agenda set by the NSS and the regional planning guidelines, in terms of the need to reduce urban sprawl and concentrate more development in the city itself, has put significant emphasis on radically improving housing output in the city through building 40,000 new homes with supporting infrastructure and services over the lifetime of the plan. Major residential developments in Dublin currently underway include Pelletstown in north Dublin, Grand Canal Basin in the Docklands and Adamstown in south County Dublin. All of these schemes also provide for improved public transport facilities, including new or upgraded rail stations. This kind of sustainable development was commended in the recent NESC report on housing in Ireland.In Sligo a series of private sector hotel, leisure, retail, and commercial developments, totalling approximately €200 million in value, have started since its designation as a gateway. The completion of the inner relief road, on which work is underway, will provide further support for Sligo's development as a gateway with the local authority co-ordinating that development through a high level team and a dedicated implementation officer.These are some examples of how we have started to build bridges between strategic planning at regional and local level and the determination of our national investment priorities. Additional support and investment will be needed in the coming years to give effect to the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines and to achieve the Government's key objectives of more balanced regional development. Important planning, land use and transportation strategies have recently been put in place in Galway, Limerick and Waterford which will make important contributions to the ongoing development of these gateways.New local area plans to take forward the role envisaged for them in the national spatial strategy have been adopted or are in the course of being prepared in respect of Cavan, Ennis, Kilkenny's western environs and the Tralee-Killarney area through the new county development plan for Kerry. Infrastructure investment generally, particularly in the areas of transport, communications, water and environmental services, is making an important contribution to the ongoing development of the gateways and hubs across the country. In publishing the national spatial strategy, the Government stated that it would take account of the strategy in moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies.Contrary to popular belief and what has been asserted, the Government did not abandon the national spatial strategy, NSS, in bringing forward the decentralisation programme. For example, my Department's current operations in Dublin are being transferred largely to Waterford, which is a gateway under the NSS, as well as Wexford and Kilkenny, both of which are hubs. However, in addition to the NSS, the Government had to take account of a wide range of other factors in selecting suitable locations for decentralisation.These other factors included the following: the core business and nature of the relevant Department or agency and the location of its customer base; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department's decentralised units within a region, which is important from a personnel perspective as well as administratively; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the new jobs involved; and the existence of good transport links and the general infrastructure capacity in the locations selected.I also emphasise that the NSS is not just about gateways and hubs. The strategy has a strong focus on the need to strengthen the county town and large town structure and the need for a renewed emphasis on the potential of small towns, villages and rural areas. The strategy envisages that county towns and other medium-sized towns would continue to play important roles as local capitals, developing their enterprise and service functions and continuing to provide opportunities for employment both in the towns themselves and in related smaller towns, villages and rural areas. The relocation of public service employment to many of these towns will help to underpin the important role which many of them will continue to play into the future.My Department will continue to work closely with regional and local authorities and with Departments and Government agencies in seeking to implement the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines. The Government is committed to taking the actions necessary to support the delivery of the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines and will work proactively to support their implementation. The reciprocal challenge for regional and local authorities is to put in place the implementation measures set out in the guidelines and to take the necessary decisions identifying the investment priorities for different regions. This is a particular challenge to local authorities to take command of the situation, use the strategies which are put in place and ensure that the development plans which are enacted locally are consistent with the overall strategies. The Government will continue to work closely with the regional and local authority structure in seeking the deliver the objective of more balanced regional development, which is accepted by all as being essential to our future national development.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The Government produced the national spatial strategy in 2002 in a blaze of publicity and then promptly lost its way in an attempt to forget about it. Stumbling in a self-made maze, more complex than any inhabited by the Minotaur of Greek mythology, the Government has made no attempt to offer visible appeasement, comparable to the seven youths and virgins demanded by the ancient creature, to regions throughout the country left without the promised infrastructure and investment.On Thursday, 6 December 2002, I said in this House, when speaking about the launch of the spatial strategy: "Once again this Government has conceptualised and formulated an idea which although fine in theory, will be a miracle if seen through to completion. Given the pitfalls which are likely to befall it, I am not holding my breath." For the sake of my lungs, it is lucky I did not do so. Two and a half years later it is clear my words were prophetic and true.The strategy has been left to gather dust on the shelves of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There is no implementation strategy with a set timetable of action in place and no guarantees that investment and infrastructure planning will correspond with the development of the regions. Throughout the country, there is a lack of balanced regional development. According to the Western Development Commission, of the €1,570 million allocated to the region under the first three years of the national development plan, NDP, only €926 million was actually spent, a shortfall of approximately €644 million that should have been spent by the mid-point of the NDP.The Government's level of capital investment under the NDP prioritises the major inter-urban routes, for example, Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Galway and Waterford, but even these are not expected to be completed until 2010. This means that other roads designated under the national development plan, especially those in the BMW region, may not be completed until 2015 or later. Road building schemes in the west, as outlined in the national development plan, are significantly behind schedule. Road schemes which were due to be completed by 2006 and which are now years behind schedule include the N4-N6 Dublin to Galway; the N3-N4 Leixlip to M50 junction; the N6 — Kinnegad to Athlone; the N6 — Athlone to Ballinasloe; the N6 — Ballinasloe to Galway; the N55, which passes through Longford and Westmeath to Athlone and is in a deplorable state; and the N52. This has been highlighted time and again in both Houses of the Oireachtas.The midlands regional planning guidelines, which were adopted last April, focus on building up the urban structure of the region in accordance with a hierarchy of towns. A Leas-Chathaoirligh, there seem to be two meetings taking place in the Chamber. The Minister should listen to my contribution.

We were disappointed with this at the time but we are doing our best in our respective local authorities to push Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon forward under the spatial strategy.The huge shortfall in investment in public transport in the BMW region was highlighted in the ESRI's mid-term evaluation of the NDP, the report of which was published in 2003. This report highlighted the fact that investment in public transport has been 43% of that forecast in the BMW region and 149% of the forecast for the south and east region. There was a massive underspend of €223 million on public transport in the BMW region at the mid-term stage of the programme.In 2002, the Department of Transport established a rural transport initiative and provided €3 million in funding for 34 rural transport projects, mainly to private operators to run the projects. In 2003 and 2004, this money was continued but, in budget 2005, the Government gave only a marginal increase to the initiative and permitted its continuation on a pilot basis for a further two years, until 2006. There is no guarantee of funding beyond that year. This gives an additional €475,000 to the scheme. However, the rural transport initiative co-ordinators sought €5 million per annum. The miserly increase barely takes account of inflation and means there can be no expansion of the initiative. It has remained the same since 2002. An average of one local bus service in each county is wholly inadequate.The re-opening of the western rail corridor was dismissed in the strategic rail review as too expensive when it was costed at €572 million. The West on Track group has put the cost at €230 million while Galway County Council's director of services maintains it could be reopened for €215 million. The western rail corridor potentially could develop a cross radial service as well as commuter services for Limerick, Sligo and Galway. Senator MacSharry has referred to this on a number of occasions. It has the potential to connect the cities, towns and many rural communities along its route and also to expand the transport of Irish exports to international markets by using ports such as Rosslare and Waterford. This rail line could serve as a vital link between Sligo, Limerick and Waterford ports. Substandard roads currently service these ports and an effective rail link could overcome this problem, with the added bonus of taking heavy goods trucks off the roads.A similar development, and something which I have campaigned for over the years, is a central rail line linking the towns of the midlands, particularly those within the triangular gateway, including Longford, Roscommon, Portlaoise and Cavan. Currently, if one wishes to make a connection to Cork from Longford, one must travel to Portlaoise, a journey of 70 miles. In the case of Cavan, the journey is more than 100 miles. The recent enterprise strategy group report recommended that there should be increased spending on public transport in the west. The western rail corridor would fit into this requirement. A figure of €250 million is the estimated cost of the project, which should be seen in the context of the hundreds of millions spent annually on our roads programme and other infrastructure projects such as the Dublin Port tunnel or the Luas.The Council of the West has criticised the Government for its neglect of the BMW region. The council says planned NDP spending on the BMW region's infrastructure was under target by 14% towards the end of 2003. Spending on roads was only 62.8% of the figure forecast, while expenditure on roads in the south and east was 143% of the figure forecast.In budget 2004, the Government announced the decentralisation of 10,300 workers out of Dublin and into the regions. The proposed locations completely ignored the spatial strategy guidelines. In November 2004, the Government reneged on its promise of decentralisation by cutting 29 regional towns from the first phase of the decentralisation programme. This was a major climb-down from its controversial plan to move more than 10,000 State officials from Dublin to the regions before the end of 2007. Only 20 towns will benefit in the initial stages of the project up to 2008 while other towns are left in limbo as to when, if ever, they will benefit from decentralisation. Towns in the BMW region to lose out include Cavan, Buncrana, Donegal, Gweedore, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Claremorris and Roscommon.

Why is there a lack of Government support for Knock Airport, the potential of which is untapped at present? It could be a huge driver of economic and tourist development across the west. The Government should have more foresight in this regard and invest in Knock Airport, which it has not done.

The same can be said for Abbeyshrule Airport, which has a population of 250,000 within a 30 mile radius. The Government has so far ignored both airports' requests for increased investment to facilitate an increase in the number and frequency of their routes, particularly the desire to begin transatlantic routes. While I do not say that for Abbeyshrule Airport, it should and could be developed as a bonus to the midlands. Many businesspeople travelling to the midlands use Abbeyshrule but it remains unrecognised by Government. Even sports team trainers in the midlands use the airport, for example, PáidíÓ Sé flies to Abbeyshrule perhaps twice a week to train the Westmeath team.

It provides a fantastic tourist amenity as well as supporting infrastructure in the midlands.

The report recommends that there should be greater emphasis on building strong networks of businesses, improving business innovation and investing more in research in the region's third level institutions. In this regard, I acknowledge the benefits brought by Abbott Ireland to the midlands, including County Longford. We look forward to the official opening of its plant in April next, which will provide 800 necessary jobs in the county.The report also paints a picture of a region that is under-performing in terms of innovation and research activities, business start-up and expansion. A particular concern is the low rate of employment of higher-level graduates. The cathaoirleach of the regional assembly emphasised that the BMW region's heavy reliance on low value-added industries renders it particularly vulnerable in the context of the decline and restructuring of traditional manufacturing, agriculture and primary processing industries. The need to enhance the region's innovative capacity, particularly in knowledge-based and research and development sectors and their attractiveness to high value added industries, therefore becomes even more pressing.The European Commission must continue to provide transitional EU funding from the Objective One budget to regions that will lose their Objective One status in 2006. The transitional arrangements that currently apply to the southern and eastern region must be applied to the BMW region post 2006.The Government has presided over a huge fall in the level of farm incomes. The average farm income has declined dramatically in the past ten years. The IFA claims that over 15,000 farm families have incomes of less than €200 per week. There is a flight from the land. Evidence of this includes the fact that since 1997 the number of young farmers claiming installation aid has fallen by around two thirds.The Government has failed to deliver the RAPID programme. The programme was initiated in February 2001 when it was announced that €2 billion would be pledged for deprived urban areas in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Dundalk, New Ross, Athy and Carrick-on-Suir. Some 25 areas were named initially, with another 20 areas added before the 2002 general election. In 2002 the Taoiseach promised that €2 billion would be spent on tackling disadvantage in underprivileged areas over the lifetime of RAPID; to date, less than 10% of this money has been allocated.In June 2003, the ESB announced its decision to close a third of its stores nationwide, citing falling revenue. This is despite the company posting a profit of €250 million and being permitted to increase its prices by 14% in 2003. In the western region, the higher cost of broadband connectivity is a major issue and a disincentive to investment. Roll-out of broadband to smaller towns is not expected to be completed until 2007.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank him for his contribution, which I found very positive, unlike the comments of Senator Bannon. The three objectives of the strategy to which the Minister referred — better spread of job opportunities, better quality of life and better places to live — are very important and I commend the Government on the progress made in this regard.The Irish Independent published an article by Treacy Hogan when the national spatial strategy was launched in November 2002. It was headed “Planning to get it right this time on traffic and housing”, but contained much on other issues. With regard to the national spatial strategy, Mr. Hogan stated:The timing is perfect. Most young people can no longer afford to live in the Dublin area and are being forced to move further and further out to the country into long-distance dormitory towns.This is an important issue. As the Minister stated, we are talking about better quality of life, better places to live and job opportunities. We know the huge pulling power of Dublin. People in the west and outside Dublin are often jealous when Dublin or east coast areas get development that other areas do not get. This follows on from the huge growth in population. Experts and Mr. Hogan claim that Dublin will have an even greater population in 20 years. We must have a strategy in place to ensure that other parts of the country are developed, that there are other places to live and work and that there is a better quality of life.Senator Bannon raised issues regarding Knock Airport. I am familiar with this and Galway's airport. They are doing very well. The chairman of Knock Airport recently spoke of its great success and development and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will be decentralised to that area. We do not need to worry about Knock Airport or investment in it. I sympathise with Senator Bannon's concerns about the western rail corridor. I do not understand why that corridor, or any section of it, was not included in the rail review. Cork was mentioned, for example. The Minister said the Midleton to Cork line will receive investment.Many costings have been rendered for the western rail line, be it called Sligo to Cork or the so-called "euroroute" of Sligo to Limerick and Rosslare. Some of these costings are absolutely inexplicable because the Sligo to Collooney line is currently included in the Dublin line, the Limerick to Cork line was always there and a good rail service from Ennis to Limerick opened recently. We must examine the issue of what I call the "missing piece" between Collooney and Ennis, including Galway city's commuter traffic. The Minister for Transport has spoken about addressing this matter in the ten-year transport investment network and the working group has considered the feasibility of the western rail corridor since June 2004. I hope the group will finalise its deliberations soon.This route passes through many of the disadvantaged areas of the west. The chairman of the western inter-county rail committee, Fr. Michéal MacGréil, has lectured in Maynooth and written on this subject often. He has highlighted that this section of rail line passes through towns suffering depopulation and poor economies. I agree with his belief that it would be of great benefit to the west to have a rail line complemented by a road network that jointly would be a euroroute as far as Rosslare.Tuam has been classified as both a hub town and a RAPID town. However, its railway station has fallen into disrepair. I welcomed the visit of the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to Tuam as part of a full-day tour starting in Tubbercurry and travelling to all the towns along that railway. This link was in use until 1975 when the freight and passenger services finished. We must emphasise the importance of this particular rail network and the difference it could make if the service was available.I have often commented on the Dublin to Galway railway line and said that 10.15 a.m. was the earliest arrival time in Galway city. On 10 January 2005 Iarnród Éireann decided to commence a Monday to Saturday service that leaves Athlone at 7 a.m. and arrives in Galway at 8.20 a.m., serving Ballinasloe, Woodlawn, Attymon and Athenry. I compliment Iarnród Éireann on this as it has been a very successful service in the six weeks or so that it has operated. It is the type of service that should be made available to commuter traffic whether it is from Claremorris, for example, through Tuam to Athenry or from Ennis to Gort and Galway city. These services were once used by workers and students. We have such traffic problems in places like Loughrea, where a bypass is being built, and the very busy village of Claregalway on the N17 that we must operate this rail service again. The opportunity the Government has provided to allow this service to be addressed in the ten-year transport investment framework is very welcome.We should also look at the issue of integrated transport. Train and bus services can be complementary rather than competitive, as they sometimes are, and there should be a better combined bus and train frequency. I welcome the prospect of Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann discussing this issue. Some of the rural transport initiatives are good examples, such as community transport operators linking with Iarnród Éireann services.I am amazed at the high number of costings of the rail corridor. One reason, perhaps, is that people are examining Sligo to Limerick or Sligo to Cork or Sligo to Limerick and Rosslare, but the "missing piece" of the Collooney to Ennis line has been costed at approximately €370 million by the director of services in Galway County Council. This figure is much smaller than the amounts first quoted by the rail review.I wish to put this in context. I have always welcomed work on bypasses. When the bypasses of Lucan, Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock occurred, people in Galway asked me why all of the money was being spent in the eastern region, but it has been of great benefit to everyone irrespective of their location to see this work taking place. We are now undertaking work on the Kinnegad route so that there will be a direct route from Galway to Dublin eventually. I welcome the Minister's comments regarding the €1.4 billion spending on national roads. It is important that we do not overlook roads while discussing the railways but the same people in Galway will refer to the headline in today's paper about €1 billion earmarked for a ring road to beat the M50 gridlock. It ties into my comments on Dublin's increasing size. This new road will stretch from Drogheda to Navan and to Naas because experts inform us that the M50 is not the answer.There will be inevitable complaints about massive spending in the east. Senator Bannon is correct that we should look at the BMW now and identify areas in which money must be spent. I covered the issue of rail comprehensively but there is more to it. Progress is being made on the bypass of Loughrea and other routes are being examined. I wish this could be carried out more quickly but there are many processes to go through.There are matters regarding providing health and educational services in hub towns. I quote Mr. Hogan's November 2002 article in the Irish Independent again when he said: “It is crucial to provide the roads, hospitals, universities, industries, government departments, houses, major rail links and good culture and recreational facilities to the new alternative cities.” Now that the spatial strategy is in place we have gateways and hub towns. We must ensure these are good places in which to live as mentioned by the Minister in his introduction.I was delighted that Tuam was designated as a hub town. The Minister knows this area very well. Tuam was rocked by the closure of the sugar factory in the 1980s and the general air of gloom and doom at the time but is beginning to pick itself up. However, I was disappointed that as a hub town it was not considered for decentralisation. Ballinasloe, which was not a hub town, got the National Roads Authority while Loughrea, a smaller town, has benefitted from decentralisation of the railway commission.It is important to look at other issues relevant to Tuam. Regarding the health services, for example, Tuam had a hospital run by the Bon Secours Order and I hope a community hospital will be established there. Other issues include education and the amalgamation of the two secondary boys' schools and the two secondary girls' schools is welcome. Being a hub town, Tuam should get priority for such developments and I hope it will.I welcome what Deputy Cullen, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, said regarding planning guidelines. Many Members and public representatives in the west talked about this matter for many years and pointed out, for example, that people with roots in rural communities and links to them should be considered for planning permission. The Minister has gone one step further. I welcome the comments which he made on his appointment regarding the need to help immigrants with regard to planning.I am delighted that the guidelines brought in by the previous Minister, with possibly more to come from the current Minister in terms of regional strategy, will be the basis of good planning practice in our local authorities. No one wants a free-for-all. We are looking for good planning practice. The guidelines with regard to areas of conservation, special protection and national heritage are not meant to operate as some kind of inflexible constraint on housing development because such development can be done in a tasteful manner. In heritage towns such as Athenry and Gort in County Galway, good planning has resulted in good housing schemes.The Minister referred to the role of local authorities. Frustrations can arise in this area with regard to issues we raise with the Minister. I will give one example. I know the Minister is familiar with Milltown, the tidiest town in County Galway for the past few years. The town is on the N17 and has been seeking a sewerage scheme to allow for greater town development. I know the scheme is due to start this year but in recent days I have seen documentation from the Department to the effect that not all the particulars have been received from the local authority. I regret that and I ask the Minister and his Department to resolve the matter with the local authority and put the scheme in place. The tender should have gone out before now and the scheme is due to start this year as part of the 2004-06 development.These are just some of the issues. In his speech, the Minister went on a bit of a tour of the country and highlighted good developments. I would like him to look at certain issues in the western region. I have concentrated mostly on railways but other issues include planning, housing, education and health. They are not all his concern but some are. They should be developed, and the funding must be there so that as the Minister rightly said, the areas become better places in which to live, with a better quality of life and a better spread of job opportunities equal to that in other parts of the country.

It is a worthwhile strategy provided it is properly and effectively underpinned by the necessary commitment. The idea of spreading development around the country and not merely in Dublin has much to recommend it. The Minister emphasised that in many of his remarks. He is a Minister with whom I have greatly agreed on other matters, particularly with regard to his guidelines to local authorities. My only wish in that regard is that he had strengthened them by putting them in the form of a directive but he is aware of my views on that issue. Having praised the Minister in that regard, I am a little sad that I have to strongly disagree with him on other matters. If I am wrong, I have no doubt the Minister will correct me.The national spatial strategy must not be seen as a flag of convenience to be raised on every occasion when it is politically expedient to do so. Initiatives designed to deliver on a national spatial strategy must be well thought out and have the genuine effect of assisting with the objectives set down in the strategy.It is striking that one of the measures cited by the Minister as evidence of his commitment to the national spatial strategy is likely to have a negative impact and not benefit the achievement of balanced, sustainable and enduring development. The Minister recently introduced changes to the retail planning guidelines by lifting the cap on the size of retail warehouses in the functional areas of the four Dublin local authorities and the gateway towns identified under the national spatial strategy. The change will apply to urban renewal areas covered by an integrated area plan in each of the areas. This opens the possibility of retail megawarehouses in the gateway towns, which will have a regional impact.Concerns have been expressed by some of the trade associations that these changes will have significant impact on the gateway and hub towns identified under the national spatial strategy. For example, an expert traffic assessment prepared by P.J. O'Connor, consulting traffic engineers, for the Irish Hardware Association, demonstrated that such large-scale developments in gateway locations would impact negatively on hub towns and the road networks surrounding gateway locations. It is hard to see how this is consistent with spatial planning.The Minister referred to Killarney and Tralee and to the county development plan. When I go home tomorrow I will investigate what stage that plan is at. Given that they are hub towns, this is a matter of serious concern as it is for all hub towns throughout the country.The retail planning guidelines as they relate to the durable goods and retail warehouse sectors have been working very well. Senators are aware of retail park developments in their areas or counties, all located in a proportionate manner, which give consumers choice, selection, innovation and value. Instead of one big outlet or one big retail park, in some areas of the country we have a more even spread of development at both gateway and hub locations which is consistent with the national spatial strategy.Although I respect the Minister's rights in the following regard — presumably every Minister has such rights, within the confines of collective Cabinet responsibility — it has emerged that the changes to the retail planning guidelines introduced by the Minister were made very much on the basis of the Minister's own personal assessments of retailing needs and not necessarily based on proper planning, advice and considerations.I was particularly taken by the Minister's reply, which I read in detail, to a question tabled by Deputy McHugh, which indicated a certain aspect to the Minister's decisions. Two internal reports prepared for the Minister on the topic recommended no change to the retail warehouse caps yet the Minister overruled them. That is his right. Although the retail planning guidelines took four years to prepare and involved four separate teams of planning expertise, the Minister made the changes without any specific independent research or studies during the review of the guidelines. He did not seek the views of the NRA on the changes, which is significant given that traffic considerations are so important.The Minister also overruled the concerns of the Dublin Transportation Office which I understand advised against the changes and ignored the balance of the submissions received on the issue. As he outlined to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am honoured to be a member, he received 71 submissions, 48 of which favoured the retention of the cap, 19 of which wanted the cap to be lifted and four of which had no view one way or the other. While it is obvious there were vested interests on both sides, the balance of the submissions clearly leaned in one direction.In light of the potentially harmful impact of these changes and the nature of the decision-making procedure involved, their consequences for the national spatial strategy must be of concern. In a sense, they represent the hallmarks of an Irish solution to a Swedish problem. This matter was not properly or expertly considered. It also creates a cynical impression of the commitment, at the highest level, to the national spatial strategy and leaves many feeling uneasy about whether there is a proper and real willingness to advance sustainable spatial planning.Members will gather from what I have said that I am unashamedly a person who favours rural and provincial towns and villages. I do not doubt the Minister's ability to deal with situations as they arise and I hope he will be able to fine-tune or refine the strategy in some necessary ways. From what he has informed me about integrated area plans, etc., it appears that the worst effects I have imagined will never come to pass.I listened with great interest to Senator Kitt's comments about Iarnród Éireann and improved rail links. I welcome the various improvements that have been made to rail lines throughout the country. I particularly welcome those to the rail service from Kerry to Dublin. As the House is aware, people in my county have been treated like second-class citizens because they live on the periphery. I congratulate the company on the improvements put in place in terms of loop lines, etc., at various stations — particularly those at Rathmore, Millstreet and on the Killarney-Mallow section on the line between Dublin and Kerry. I am interested, however, in discovering when we will be rid of the pre-war carriages, particularly those on the service from Tralee through Killarney to Cork. When will new rolling stock be put in place? A commitment was made in respect of such rolling stock but I do not know when it will arrive.Many more people have taken to travelling by rail than used to be the case. This is a welcome development. I recently passed through the countryside between Navan and Nobber and, in the vicinity of Wilkinstown and Castletown, I saw some disused rail tracks. I inquired about them and discovered that they connect Kingscourt to Drogheda. I am sure this line could be restored and a spur to Navan attached to it. When the Navan-Dublin line is connected, it could run further if this link was established. Dublin could, therefore, be connected to Cavan. I hope the Government's thinking is leaning in this direction because rail lines are extremely important in terms of connecting different parts of the country. I hope that we will invest increased funding and better resources in our rail system in the future.I welcome developments to date. I congratulate Iarnród Éireann on the improvements put in place and I look forward to the company honouring its commitment to provide new carriages on all services throughout the country.

I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. We have had similar debates in recent weeks in respect of the BMW region, regional transportation and, yesterday, the OECD report on third-level education. I ask, therefore, that the Minister indulge me if my comments are somewhat repetitive.The national spatial strategy is probably the best plan envisaged in terms of Ireland's potential development during the next 20 to 30 years. It allows, through the gateways and hubs, various towns and cities to grow to their potential in a cohesive way and, as I understand it, take the pressure off the Dublin area where development, growth, etc., are obviously out of control.I first heard of the national spatial strategy — long before I was elected to the Seanad — at a conference in Limerick. The essence of that conference was that we should create capacity before demand. No one would argue with the fact that the Government has done a great deal in pursuit of the aspirations of the national spatial strategy in terms of the level of investment in all aspects of our infrastructure. I refer, for example, to our roads, in respect of which a further investment of €1.4 billion was announced earlier today, and rail. As regards the latter, Senator Coghlan referred to new rolling stock and I understand that Iarnród Éireann has 400 carriages on order. I regret that the service into Killarney will probably benefit from the use of those carriages long before that into Sligo will be catered for.

#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	138	There has been an unprecedented level of investment in all areas of infrastructure. However, I have a number of major concerns about the strategy. While I have no doubt that the Government and members of the Cabinet are loyal and fully committed to the aspirations and principles of the national spatial strategy, I stated when it was launched that there may have been a need for legislation or a directive, at the very least, to encourage all arms of State — semi-State bodies and all agencies that are State controlled or funded — to buy into those aspirations and principles before taking any action. I am satisfied that this has not happened. It would be a great shame if such a good plan failed because everyone did not sing from the same hymn sheet. The national spatial strategy should be the prime directive for every State organisation and local authority as they plan for the future. I do not believe this is happening.While I paid tribute to Iarnród Éireann earlier, I must now accuse it of ignoring the spatial strategy. I refer to the fact that in Sligo, which is a gateway city, a freight yard and all the infrastructure attaching thereto is being closed by Iarnród Éireann. It is inconceivable that the company should set out to close a facility such as this in a gateway city, the population of which is expected to increase under the plan by some 50,000 during the next 30 years. This does not make sense. Iarnród Éireann will state that it closed the yard for commercial reasons. I do not know who is the head of marketing at the company but he or she need only visit any roundabout on the N4, from the M50 to Carraroe in Sligo, to see the approximately 100 container trucks per hour that pass by. Issues surrounding public safety and congestion arise as a result. The head of marketing at Iarnród Éireann should stand at one of the roundabouts to which I refer and take down details of the hauliers or the companies transporting these goods by road instead of rail and target a marketing campaign at them. Perhaps then there would be no need to close freight yards.Bord Gáis, contrary to the aspirations and principles of the spatial strategy, is completely ignoring the entire north-west region. At a recent meeting of the relevant joint committee, the chief executive of the company proudly declared how well things are going and that under the Gas Acts and its commercial mandate, it has no intention or plans to bring the gas network to the north-west. That is unacceptable.In general terms, the commercial mandate in the semi-State sector supersedes all aspirations in the national spatial strategy. Board members are more concerned with ensuring that the bottom line remains balanced during their tenure. We should adopt a more visionary approach in terms of what might happen in the future. If we invest in line with the national spatial strategy and create capacity before demand, then the demand will follow and we will reap the rewards. Whatever investment we make now, it will represent value for money in time.I would like a directive to go to all arms of the State to ensure they take account not only of the bottom line and the commercial mandate but of the national spatial strategy before they act on the closure, cancellation or planning of anything for the future. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, when he was here, alluded to the speech in this House last week by the Minister for Finance in which he said he would look at any project that any region proposed, be it infrastructure development or whatever, provided that it made economic sense. However, if we are always going to take the cost-benefit analysis as the bottom line we can close the door on the north west of Ireland, indeed north of a line from Dublin to Galway and east of the Dublin-Belfast corridor. The door will be closed on the west of Ireland unless we are prepared to put in the capacity before the demand materialises. It is a chicken and egg situation.In today's Irish Independent there is a report that the Government is considering the construction of an outer ring road linking Drogheda, Navan and towns towards Naas. If that is the way we are now thinking, it is an admission and acceptance of the Central Statistics Office prediction of 1 million more people in the country in the next 20 years, with 80% of them living in the greater Dublin area. We are accepting failure now by saying, “Let us build this outer ring road”. I am not saying it should not be built, but I believe we should be investing more in the gateways and hubs, in trying to achieve our targets.If there is an extra 1 million people in the country by 2020 and they want to be in the greater Dublin area, let us set a target to put the infrastructure in place in the other gateways and hubs to try to locate 400,000 or 500,000 of them to the other areas. Otherwise, we are admitting defeat. In another ten years, where will the ring road be? Will it take in Dundalk and Mullingar and will it be further out ten years after that? We need to be more strategic and not reacting to the inevitable. We should plan and be proactive about what we could achieve. In many ways the national spatial strategy could end up on a shelf with many other plans that have never achieved their potential. The strategy has massive potential and I want it to be a success.In terms of the north west, it is not going to be economically viable, in the NRA's terms, to build a motorway to Sligo. The M4 has now become the M4-M6 and we currently have a great road to Sligo. However, we should be planning these routeways. The board of directors of Bord Gáis should have an aspiration to have gas in Letterkenny. If a subvention is required, that is a matter for the Government. The Houses of the Oireachtas will debate the issue and put the relevant subvention in place. EU permission will be required and it should be sought. There is no university or radiotherapy unit north of a line between Dublin and Galway. Similarly, there are many other facilities which do not exist north of that line and if we are serious about the spatial spread of people and opportunities, as the national spatial strategy aspires to be, then we will have to be speculative to the extent that capacity must be created before demand. I first heard that argument, capacity before demand, from the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, at a conference in Limerick on the national spatial strategy. I cannot repeat it often enough.I appeal for either legislation or a clear directive in this area. I ask that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government liaise with the Department of Finance in reviewing the various taxation schemes that may be put in place. I hope that the urban and rural renewal schemes are extended for particular areas north of the Dublin to Galway line because there is still much scope for them to lead development. I very much appreciate the Minister of State's reference to Sligo. I cannot help thinking this has been for my benefit, because I have been so vocal in this regard in the House.There have been enormous benefits so far from the national spatial strategy. These have, for the most part, been privately led, and Sligo is an example, because of the perception and the expectation that central Government will invest more in the critical infrastructure of these areas, as well as their linkages to Dublin and the other hubs and gateways throughout the country. I hope the Minister of State will take some of these points on board.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on the national spatial strategy. The Government missed a golden opportunity with regard to the spatial strategy plan for the country, as happened previously in connection with the reorganisation of the local authorities when the then Government missed a similar opportunity to put a proper plan in place. We now have a mess. If one speaks to council staff and the public, one finds people are getting a worse service from the local authorities than heretofore. The opportunity was missed, as regards their reorganisation, to make them more efficient. There is no reason local authorities may not be as efficient as any other business. They have certain obligations to provide public services and so forth but there is no reason why they cannot be as efficient as private enterprise. I believe they can be.The Government should have put more thought into how it went about devising the spatial strategy plan, particularly as regards regional balance. As Senator MacSharry said, there were debates on this in the BMW region over the last couple of weeks. I will not be repetitive, but I would like the Minister of State to clarify the following sentence in his speech:The ten-year transport investment framework, now in preparation will take account of the linkages between transport, land use and spatial planning, and will be fully informed by, and support the policies set out in the national spatial strategy.This is akin to a chicken and egg situation. Local authorities put county development plans in place, which only last five years. There is now an obligation for county development plans to be replaced every five years. We now see that two counties in particular, Laois and Offaly, have introduced county development plans which zone land in rural villages within their respective local authorities.With regard to what the Minister of State has said concerning linkages to transport, land use and spatial planning being fully informed, if a local authority decides to zone in a rural town and there is no back-up from the Government as regards proper access to roads, rail, air or whatever transport for the ensuing ten years, what will be the position? Senator Kitt mentioned the Sligo to Ennis rail link, or as some people like to call it, the Sligo-Waterford link, which would be part of a European rail network. There is no reason why there could not be a linkage from Westport via Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam, Athenry and into Galway. I believe larger centres must be grown in some areas, whether it is in the west, the south or north, to draw away from Dublin, which has become a magnet for every other region. To this the Government must put the infrastructure in place in the poorer regions. There is no other way to proceed. The transport infrastructure for national primary and secondary routes, rail and air access must be put in place. If not, it cannot be achieved. As Senator MacSharry pointed out, an outer relief road is now being planned for Dublin. This road might stretch from Drogheda to Navan and on to Naas, and probably on to Laois and Wicklow. If that road was built on the west coast, from Limerick to Galway to Sligo, it might draw from the magnet on the east coast. If one goes through the figures in place for infrastructure along the east coast, it is unbelievable in comparison to the figures for the west coast. How can the regions be developed if investment is not being provided?We have to go back to the kernel of the Minister's speech on the linkages between transport, land use and spatial planning. Greater debate will have to take place in this regard. Above all, infrastructure in the poorer regions will have to be put in place, such as water, sewerage systems, national primary and secondary routes and especially rail transport. While this may not look right from the financial planning point of view, it is the way to go in the long term. Other than that, Dublin will become even more of a magnet. If all the infrastructure is developed in the greater Dublin area, more and more people and industries will gravitate to that region.This development will leave local authorities in other areas in a poorer condition with a less buoyant rate base. In County Mayo, a new waste water treatment unit is required for Castlebar which will cost more than €50 million and is being developed under a public private partnership. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now looking for the local authority to raise €12 million to €14 million so that the scheme can get off the ground. If the local authority does not have a good rate base, from where can it raise these extra funds? Where can it raise the necessary local contribution to put funding mechanisms in place to back up departmental funding?No industry has been provided in Mayo over the past seven or eight years. It is incredible to think that a county of that size has not had any new jobs created in the past eight years. We have lost 1,000 jobs in Castlebar with the closure of Volex as well as 350 jobs in Westport. Similar things have happened in other areas and that means the rate base will decline. This will make it more difficult for local authorities to raise an initial contribution to get backing from the Department. Greater debate will have to take place about the issue of linkage between transport, land use and spatial planning. More funding will have to be put in place for the regions, especially for services, roads, railways and water treatment units.

The national spatial strategy is an important and positive principle, as it is about trying to spread development evenly around the country due to growth pressures in Dublin. Every day we read about projects that cost billions of euro — today it is the outer ring road and last week it was about various public transport schemes in the greater Dublin area. I would not dispute that such investments are necessary, but they are also having the effect of reinforcing concentrations around the Dublin area. It is important to recognise that even a fraction of that level of investment in other regions would make an enormous impact. It is very important that we do not just see infrastructural development that is mainly for the 50 mile radius around Dublin.I have a certain ambivalence towards the national spatial strategy. My brother was involved in the advisory group on the strategy. He is a local authority official in Cork and helped prepare the strategy. Many people from that perspective believe that too many hubs and gateways were created. I do not come from that point of view. I come from a county which was very annoyed that Clonmel was not designated as a hub. It is a hub regardless of whether the strategy chooses to describe it as such and it is more than a county town. It has a fantastic range of industry and has no difficulty in attracting new industry and new investment. It is probably the largest town outside the 50 mile radius of Dublin that was not included.We feel grateful for the fact that we live in a market-led economy rather than a planned economy. If we lived in a planned economy, it would be very serious. In our economy, the market will decide to a large extent where it will invest in additional housing, services and so on. The infrastructure improvements in national roads make locations along those roads more attractive in a way that is not reflected in the national spatial strategy. I am happy that the strategy is not overly constraining. It is qualitatively rather similar, but on a much larger scale, to the CLÁR and RAPID programmes. It is a consideration which can be adduced to support investment in particular areas. It clearly is not the only criterion. I am glad that decentralisation was not just concentrated, as some of its critics claimed it should have been, on the hubs and gateways. The term "gateway" makes no sense if all activity is imagined as being stuck under the gate. The term "hub" makes no sense unless there is much activity spread around it.I support the points made about improving public transport infrastructure. It seems that it is necessary to refurbish existing infrastructure around the main cities to provide commuter and regional public transport services. The arguments Senator Paddy Burke and others made regarding the north west can also be made in relation to the Limerick and Waterford areas. Some steps have been taken in that regard. For example, the Minister, Deputy Roche, referred in depth to the Mallow-Cork-Midleton commuter line.The effects of the Celtic tiger reached some parts of the country relatively slowly and have only been felt in some places in the past year or two. The announcement of decentralisation had a significant stimulatory effect on private investment in certain places even though the offices in question have yet to open in most cases. Balanced regional development is very important and a great deal of progress has been made in many centres. Many of the main towns in south Tipperary, excluding Clonmel which is already thriving, have taken off in the past year or two in ways in which they did not during earlier periods of growth. This suggests that as congestion increases and costs rise in larger centres, market forces naturally push people to examine locations at the periphery. It is very important to ensure that infrastructural, cultural and sporting investment is made at a level which guarantees the quality of life of people in these areas.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I thank Senators for their contributions to today's debate. While the spatial strategy has only been in place for two years and was always intended to constitute a long-term policy, some speakers have sought to convey the impression that everything should be achieved within a short space of time. A great deal of progress has been made to spread the message and embed the strategy in the plans and programmes of Departments, Government agencies and wider regional and local authority structures. The first act had to be to ensure that all Government agencies fell into line with the strategy and recognised the need to implement it in their various national, regional and local plans.Looking forward, it is timely to recall the fundamental objectives of the spatial strategy and pursue the further measures required to support them practically. I feel confident that the important gateway investment priority study, commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in co-operation with Forfás, will be taken on board by Government and have a significant influence on investment priorities into the future. While a number of gateways have put in place the development frameworks, including land-use policies, required to transmit the message of the strategy, others have not. All such frameworks will be in place by the end of 2005. The nationwide adoption of regional planning guidelines will be followed by their implementation in the statutory planning functions of local authorities. The guidelines will have a strong influence in the determination of investment priorities by Departments and agencies.Substantial progress has been made on the major infrastructural projects which constitute a key element in the roll-out of the strategy. The first phase of the regional broadband programme to construct broadband networks in 19 towns and cities has been completed. Phase 2 will bring broadband to more than 90 towns with populations greater than 1,500 over the next three years. The group broadband scheme offers up to 50% of the funding required to meet the costs of establishing broadband connectivity for rural communities and towns with populations of less than 1,500.Many of the speakers to whom I listened since I arrived emphasised infrastructure. Extensive infrastructural development has not taken place only in Dublin or the east in general. Major sewerage treatment plants have commenced operations in the past 12 months in Cork, Limerick and Galway and will facilitate continued development in these gateways. The pace of the national roads programme is being maintained and anyone who travels around Ireland will be aware of the excellent roads which have been constructed as a result of a significant investment of almost €8 billion over the past seven to eight years.Key projects completed in the past year alone include phase 1 of the Limerick southern ring-road and the Monasterevin, Cashel and Ballincollig bypasses, none of which is in the Dublin area. Projects which are under way include bypasses at Ennis, Sligo, Dundalk and Fermoy and national secondary bypasses in Cavan and Mullingar. It is interesting that on the day the House debates this matter, the NRA is launching its investment programme of €1.4 billion for road infrastructure in 2005. My Department has already announced a record provision of €500 million for non-national roads. A significant level of investment is being made.Perhaps politicians are all the same and act in a similar way on different issues. We call constantly for development and infrastructure but when it is provided we run scared and side with objectors. We must be reasonably consistent. To demand of the Government that it provide something and to suggest one does not want it when it comes is inconsistent. Senator Bannon said earlier that the Government was dragging its feet on the M3. While I am glad the Fine Gael candidate in the Meath by-election is in favour of the proposed motorway, very mixed signals have come from the party over the years all the way from the very top. People did not know whether they wanted the road. I hear Fine Gael is now in bed with the Labour Party which is absolutely against the development and maintains it will happen over its dead body. I do not know how long the marriage will last.

While there are some who demand infrastructure and wish to be able to refer to the sums of money which have been spent in their counties, there will always be people with an opposing view. Many people with a nice standard of living are of the opinion that while it is nice to have access to infrastructure, it should not be built too near them. We must be brave in calling for development and be prepared to stand up to people.

However, it is not all about debate; it is about delivery and making decisions and seeing them happen on the ground. Having a great debate is not an end in itself, rather a means to an end. It is all right if one makes a decision, but it is easy to come in here and criticise.Senator Bannon referred to Abbeyshrule airport, and I wish him well. When we discussed Knock Airport not so long ago, Fine Gael and the Labour Party did everything possible to stop the proposal before it got out of the starting blocks, and some very derogatory remarks were made.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I agree that this whole debate is about infrastructure, which is being provided. Some €1,400 million has today been allocated for national roads, together with non-national roads. The figures being invested are enormous and many Members living in the country will see the results. I see them on my occasional visits around the country. Infrastructure is being provided and some great jobs have been done. Perhaps they took too long in some cases, perhaps they did not. However, the work is being done and the investment is being made.The national spatial strategy never envisaged that the Dublin area must be forgotten. Rather, it is concerned with providing alternatives and developing other parts of the country to enable them to compete with Dublin. It was never intended to run down Dublin. The target is that growth and development in other regions will outstrip Dublin in the future but we are not going to move everybody out of Dublin. It is important that services are provided for people who live in Dublin and want to stay there and have a good quality of life. However, it is hoped that in the future other regions, gateways and hubs will develop at a faster pace than Dublin.The national spatial strategy also strongly supports rural development and in this regard the Western Development Commission has launched its Look West initiative aimed at people living in the greater Dublin area who may consider moving to the west for quality of life reasons. My Department's guidelines on sustainable rural housing for planning authorities, published in draft form last year, seek to ensure that people in the rural community are facilitated in obtaining planning permission for their housing proposals. In the interests of sustaining population levels in the future, planning authorities are required to ensure any demand for housing in rural areas suffering from population decline is subject to good planning practice and accommodated.

It is a Government policy, it will happen and it is happening. However, we first need to get the message out, including the policy and plans. There is no point in the Government alone speaking about them unless the policies and plans are implemented or embedded in other strategies and policies at different levels, national, regional and local. That is happening, the commitment and resources are there and the infrastructure is being provided. It is a long-term strategy, the fruits of which will be increasingly evident over the years.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the House concerning the recent Supreme Court judgment on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004. As the House is aware, for the past 50 years, people in long-term institutional care have made a contribution towards their shelter and maintenance. That principle of making such a contribution has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Those aspects of the Bill that provide a legal basis for doing so were found by the Supreme Court to be constitutional.The Supreme Court did not find unconstitutional the retrospective nature of the legislation under Article 15.5, which deals with retrospective legislation, making something unlawful that was lawful at the time. The court did not strike the legislation down under that provision but stated that it was unconstitutional because it infringed on the property rights of the persons in question. The court argued strongly that if someone is to take away one's property rights, it can only be done if the people involved are compensated. The only time it would be constitutional to remove property rights without paying compensation would be if it were to cause, in the words of the court, "disequilibrium in the public finances". The court held that a sum of €500 million would not cause a disequilibrium in the public finances, given that the health spend for 2005 will be €11 billion. That is the position that has been adopted by the court and we must now act on foot of that decision.At least we now have legal clarity on a matter that had been allowed to fester since 1976. The genesis of the difficulty goes back to a Supreme Court case, which was an appeal of a High Court case, namely, the Maud McInerney case. Ms McInerney was an elderly resident of Crooksling Hospital, Brittas, County Dublin. She succeeded in her Supreme Court challenge to a High Court decision that because she was fully eligible under the 1970 Act, she did not have to pay any contribution towards her care. At the time, the then Minister and the Government brought in a regulation to give effect to the Supreme Court's decision. That regulation was certainly in order but at the same time they issued a circular to all health boards stating that they could withdraw medical cards from people in long-term care since their medical needs were being met. That meant, therefore, that they were not fully eligible and they could go on to charge them. The Supreme Court has now held that there was no legal basis for doing so.Last week, I stated in the Lower House that I first became aware of the problem in November when I consulted the Attorney General. He told me there was a legal problem and that we could not continue to make these charges because we had no legal basis for doing so. Until very recently, I had always felt that these charges were levelled in good faith. I now know from documents that have come to light in the context of John Travers' report and, indeed, of the Supreme Court's decision that going back to 1978, there was strong legal opinion, which was clearly stated, from a former Chief Justice, Mr. Ronan Keane, and Mr. Thomas McCann, SC, that there was no legal basis for imposing these charges and that they should not continue without a legal basis. Therefore, the charges continued for almost 30 years without a legal basis. I cannot now stand over my assertion in December that the charges were levelled in good faith.In December, I announced the appointment of Mr. John Travers to examine why this had happened, why it went on for so long, who was aware of the illegal basis on which this was done and what efforts were made by the Department of Health and Children to seek level advice and rectify the situation. I gave Mr. Travers terms of reference which included looking back on what had occurred, making recommendations on how we can go forward and what changes we need to put in place to ensure the State is not exposed in this fashion again as regards any charges it might impose on citizens. I gave Mr. Travers until 1 March 2005 as a deadline for the completion of his report, although I explained when I met him in December that if he required more time I would obviously give it to him.Last Friday, I met Mr. Travers for the first time since I appointed him because he had interviewed a number of Ministers, former Ministers and officials of the Department of Health and Children. I am reasonably optimistic that I will have the report within the specified timeframe, although if any inferences or references are made to individuals they are entitled, as a matter of natural justice, to see what is being said about them before the report is finalised. Clearly, Mr. Travers will be going through that process as everyone else does. Subject to that, however, I hope to have the report in the next couple of days, following which I will take it to Government and publish it.This sorry mess, which will cost us at least €500 million and perhaps much more, need not and should not have happened. Yesterday, the Government approved legislation to make this legal going forward because every week that this charge cannot be levelled costs us €2.5 million. That is €2.5 million that otherwise could be spent on health services. In all, over €100 million is raised annually from this particular charge.We must also pay back the moneys that were collected illegally. The Government has established a Cabinet sub-committee, comprising the Taoiseach, myself, the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General, to examine the mammoth task of how we will set about making these repayments. We must pay everybody back for six years, including the estates or personal representatives of deceased persons. In addition, we cannot apply the Statute of Limitations to anybody of unsound mind. Therefore, those in mental health institutions and intellectually disabled people in institutional care must be paid right back to the start.I want to avoid a situation where citizens — particularly, vulnerable, elderly people in long-term care — are forced to take a legal route to try to get their money back. Subject to Cabinet approval, therefore, it is my view that we need to set a mechanism in place to make it easy for people to apply to have their money returned. Clearly, those people who can be identified will be, but in many parts of the country we do not have good records — certainly not going back as far as we will have to concerning those who were in institutional care. We have to make it as easy as possible for those persons and their families or representatives to be able to access that to which they are entitled.As a result of Government decisions, I hope to be in a position shortly to explain publicly the format of the scheme that will be put in place. Not only do I want to make it easy for the individuals involved, but also I want to avoid unnecessary litigation. I want to avoid millions of euro of taxpayers' money going unnecessarily to lawyers, which is what will happen if we do not put a fair, transparent and honest scheme in place.I am happy to have the opportunity to address the House on this matter. I thank Senators for having raised the issue, which is of major concern. The sum of money involved could pay for the construction of a new children's hospital in Crumlin, a new Mater Hospital and probably at least one other hospital. That is what we are talking about — it is a vast sum of money. Most people have acknowledged that making a contribution towards shelter and maintenance, which citizens in the community have to look after for themselves, is not unreasonable. As I have said, everybody that has been in Government for the past 50 years has abided by that principle, which is not one that has been challenged very often.Yesterday, the Government cleared the legislation to make the position legal and we will publish it later this week. It is incorporated in the legislation that will provide for doctor-only medical cards. It made sense to do it as quickly as possible because those resources are badly needed in the health service. Most people agree that a contribution should be made. The maximum contribution that can be taken is up to 80% of the non-contributory pension. Heretofore no maximum limit was set in legislation.My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, will take over later. I apologise to the House as a Cabinet sub-committee on health, in addition to the sub-committee relating to this matter, will meet this afternoon. I am not in a position to stay for the duration of this debate although I will be present for the main speakers from the Opposition. I do not wish that to taken as a discourtesy to the House. It is just not possible for me to stay for the entire debate because of two important Cabinet sub-committees that will sit this afternoon.

The phrase "collective responsibility" springs to mind. In 2002 the outgoing Government of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil rejoiced and proclaimed the great deeds they had achieved and what they would do after the general election. That approach has now been abandoned and the blame game is in train. The Progressive Democrats Party has made no secret of the fact that it holds the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, responsible.

She has been lucky enough to be in Cabinet for almost eight years. She should have discussed this but she did not. The major decision to award medical cards to over-70 year olds in 2001 was not properly thought out and has led to this unholy mess. The Government wants to turn the clock back and go back years. It is being disingenuous in that regard.

The most shocking aspect of this sorry saga is that patients in nursing homes and their families who queried their obligation to pay were able to get away with not paying. However, anyone unable to speak up for him or herself continued to pay.I agree with the Tánaiste in that people who can afford to do so should pay for health care.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I should think so.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	179	We are fully in favour of that approach. I was in contact with the Health Service Executive yesterday and was informed that the practice of the former health board in the Carlow area was that 75% of a pension was taken, which makes perfect sense. Nobody would query that. The Government and politicians have failed miserably.We should not forget that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was Attorney General at the time. I want to put that back on the record as it has conveniently been forgotten. The Tánaiste was also in the Cabinet with a different portfolio. Collective responsibility does apply.A meeting took place when difficulties were pointed out. That meeting appears to have been completely farcical; Ministers arrived late, left early or missed a crucial part of the meeting. The minutes of the meeting appear not to have been given to the relevant Ministers, nor were the difficulties pointed out to them. This comes across as being extremely amateurish.The effect is that taxpayers are faced with a significant bill of up to €500 million, if not more. Today's Irish Independent refers to a sum of €1 billion on the basis that people would get back interest on top of the money they are owed. Will the Tánaiste please clarify this point in her concluding remarks?Another issue of concern is the entitlements of those people who tried to get their aged parents or relatives into public beds in nursing homes but were unable to do so because no public beds were available. Such people had no choice but to avail of private nursing homes. I believe 20 legal writs have already been issued in connection with such cases. If those court cases succeed, they will open an enormous can of worms. The Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, has already publicly stated her belief that they have a very good case. The premise is that if one is aged over 70 years and is entitled to free medical care in a public nursing home, one should be entitled to a similar level of free care in a private nursing home as the State has not fulfilled its obligations.I understand that 275,000 potential cases exist. Some 27,000 cases are pending in the former South Eastern Health Board area, of which 5,500 relate to County Carlow. The Tánaiste can correct me if I am wrong but the average length of stay for patients in nursing homes is ten months. According to figures I received from the Health Service Executive people would be entitled to approximately €6,000. If people spent more or less time in a nursing home then the figure would vary. The Government tried to give an ex gratia payment of €2,000, which is significantly below the figure to which they may be properly entitled. At the time we pointed out that it would only take one successful court case to challenge that and the floodgates would be opened. The Supreme Court judgment has now saved us getting to that stage.I am interested in ascertaining the terms of reference of the report being carried out by Mr. John Travers. Will the Tánaiste clarify if the infamous meeting with Ministers coming and going will be included in the terms of reference? That was a key meeting when the issue of illegal charging for nursing home care was raised, yet it was not brought to the Ministers' attention, or so they claim. That issue must be examined as a matter of urgency.It is vital that people who are owed money do not have to go to the courts. The last thing we need is a repeat of the Army deafness claim, which ultimately proved a disgrace in terms of the amount of money paid out to the legal teams involved.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Nobody was happy with that scenario. We should learn from those mistakes. If people have been wronged they deserve compensation. The last thing we need is for taxpayers to be doubly punished by large legal teams capitalising on the issue.The Supreme Court ruled that there is nothing wrong with having charges for long-term care. I do not know any political party that would quibble with that and I hope none of them would. However, the court found that there was no statutory basis for charges to be levied.It is worth noting the efforts to which the Fine Gael Party went in order to resolve the issue. Last October, Deputy Perry questioned the Taoiseach about the matter in the Dáil. The Taoiseach consistently skirted around the issue. At the time the State's liability was estimated to be €100 million. We finally reached a breakthrough on 8 December in response to questions from Deputy Kenny. The Tánaiste admitted that primary legislation was being urgently drafted to clarify the legality of payments made by pensioners towards their care in nursing homes.It is clear that a new Bill is required. This has been mooted in the newspapers. The Tánaiste referred to a Bill of entitlements.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	182	An eligibility Bill.

That is sorely lacking at present. It is a failure of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that when medical cards were introduced for over-70 year olds, such a Bill was not introduced at the same time. We need to clarify exactly to what people are entitled as they grow older.In spite of what the Tánaiste said, the public perception is that the former Minister, Deputy Martin, has a great deal of questions to answer in this area, as does the former Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who ironically had responsibility for care of the elderly. He did not fulfil his obligations in that regard. He is lucky that the reshuffle has already taken place because he would not have been reappointed had the Taoiseach known about the mess in which he afterwards landed the Government. I could spend hours speaking on this matter and stating "We told you so", but I will not do so as it is unhelpful and will not progress the case any further.The Tánaiste's point about what could have been achieved using the huge sums of money in terms of new hospitals and so on makes the situation even more serious. The people who had money taken from them wrongly must have it repaid to them immediately. I am not sure whether the Tánaiste will be successful in limiting the payments back to 1999 because I suspect it may take another court case from before that point to open the floodgates.A great deal of incompetence has been demonstrated by the Government on this issue for which the entire Cabinet must take responsibility, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, since he was the Attorney General at the time. We need to examine the systems in the health services so that we avoid similar debacles. If the Health Service Executive is made aware of a problem or suspects one, action must be taken immediately to rectify it, rather than it continuing for years and landing us in the type of mess in which we are now.I apologise that I am unable to stay for the debate because I must attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food on the issue of Carlow sugar factory. However, Fine Gael will be represented in the Chamber.

It has been a festering sore for some 29 years and there is no point in people stating that it is the responsibility of the incumbent Government. Rather, it is the responsibility of the incumbent Government to take action. Our society is governed by legislation and the Government and the Oireachtas will have confidence that continuing the policy of people making contributions towards shelter and maintenance is not alone fair but is also consistent with the Constitution.Since this news broke, a number of people have contacted me about this unfortunate situation. When I worked in the community, I was sent to a particular county to try to find the relatives of a person in the care of a long-stay psychiatric institution who had passed away. However, no such situation will exist now because the relatives will come out of the woodwork, which has already regrettably happened. It will be interesting to see the visitors' books in a number of those institutions to see if people who arrive claiming to be relatives of those who have passed on to their eternal reward have signed the book in the past.

We should recognise the situation which exists. Legislation was brought forward to correct a situation which should have been corrected in the 1970s. The Tánaiste in very clear and has specified in concise terms why the legislation was deemed unconstitutional.Only yesterday, an individual contacted me stating that there is no way in the world that the excellent care provided by our public and private nursing homes should be paid for entirely by the State and the taxpayer. I did not ask on which cloud the individual was but if that is a reflection of what is going through the minds of certain sections of society, we have become a very sorry and sick society.Senator Browne is incorrect to state that the average stay in private nursing homes is ten months. Rather, the time for women is three years and for men it is two years.

The Oireachtas played its part, as did the Council of State, the President and the Supreme Court. As everyone knows and has been stated by the Tánaiste, permission to take up to 80% of a non-contributory pension has been in place. In my experience, where people have been in long-term care and where deductions have been made on the basis outlined by the Tánaiste, in many cases it was very difficult for the people involved to spend the 15% or 20% of the money which remained. In some cases, it was not enough but in many cases, the people in question did not need it and did not spend it. However, when these people passed on, the first question to be posed would be how much they had left in their wills.For example, when they were eventually located, the first question asked by the relatives of a fine old gentleman who liked his baby Power's whiskey and enjoyed smoking his pipe was whether he had left anything in his will. All he had was a couple of suits of clothes which were the property of the Midland Health Board, which the family proceeded to remove. This is what one is dealing with.Where do we go from here? We must continue what has been started. It is deeply regrettable that it took so long to clarify the implication of a Supreme Court decision of 29 years ago. We now have a definitive resolution which is very welcome. Members will now be in a position to study the Supreme Court ruling in detail, the key elements of which have already been read into the record by the Tánaiste in the Lower House.The provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 which provides for the prospective charging of in-patients is constitutional. There is no constitutional prohibition on implementing a charge for in-patient services in future. The Bill was not contrary, as has already been pointed out by the Tánaiste today, to Article 15.5 of the Constitution in that it was not within the prohibition of retrospective legislation in that article. This is because the article is confined to rendering something unlawful which was, at the time of its commission, not unlawful.The Bill is unconstitutional, as has already been stated, in regard to the property rights of citizens. While taking away a property right without compensation can be justified under the Constitution, it can only be justified to either avoid an extreme financial crisis or a fundamental disequilibrium in public finances. It is clear that the Supreme Court did not consider the exposure of the State or the sums involved, in the order of €500 million, to meet that criterion.The Bill was brought forward but fell at a hurdle. In that context, I commend the Council of State on recommending a referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court and the President for doing so. At least we now know where we are going. It is easy to state that the Government did not do this or that. To my knowledge, no political party in this House has ever taken a stance or sought a mandate since 1976 to remove these charges. Every Government in the interim period from that date has continued with them. If political parties wish to assign political blame, it must surely be on an inclusive basis since 1976.The Tánaiste has stated that she will not now stand over an assertion she made in the House pertaining to the bringing forward of the Bill given what is now known and neither will I. We must go back to the drawing board and we need to put right what needs to be so. Above all, we must continue to look after those who built up this State and are now unable to look after themselves.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I wish the Tánaiste well with her difficult brief. I appreciate that she had the courage to say recently that she would not stand over the statement she made previously to the House. I admire it when politicians admit when they get something wrong and correct the record. That is as it should be; it is no big deal. On a previous occasion I made an appeal that this matter not become a party political football. Nobody has all the wisdom on this issue. We can now speak with 20/20 hindsight and this applies to all parties and none.This is an error which we must address now. I said from the start that there would not be a problem with retrospection. All parties in the House have, at some time, introduced retrospective legislation. The Constitution does not allow us to make criminality retrospective but it does allow us to bring retrospection to bear on many other matters. The last time we passed retrospective legislation was to approve the appointment of a judge 16 years after he sat on the Bench; it clarified that all his decisions over those 16 years were legal. That is the last case I can recall but it was not the only one. It has certainly happened half a dozen times in the 18 or 19 years since Senator Norris and I were elected to this august body.When the news of the judgment broke, I was in the company of a colleague from Scotland. His elderly parent is in a home in the Shetlands and he is paying the home £900 per week. He will continue to pay that until his father's estate is reduced to less than £10,000 in total. That is the situation in the neighbouring jurisdiction. I have no problem with payment. There will always be some element of payment. The concept of relating it to an amount, such as 80% of the non-contributory pension as suggested by the Tánaiste, is a fair and reasonable way to approach it.What we must now deal with is how to repay the money. I agree with Senator Glynn that some of the people who will queue to claim this money showed little regard for the people for whom they are claiming. We must accept that this will happen. People's level of responsibility for their elderly parents and relatives is not something which should be disregarded. It is a responsibility which we all must accept in some way, even if not necessarily financially. Many things can be done in this regard. Senator Browne made an important point when he suggested that we clearly outline the entitlements of people who reach the age of 65 or 70 years. To what are they entitled in this and other areas?We must increase the number of nursing home places, both public and private. Tax breaks for people providing such places is important. It has made inroads into the problem and has helped the private sector. However, in all fairness, as I suggested with regard to child care yesterday, people who are paying to support elderly family members in nursing homes should benefit from a tax credit. That would remove some of the pressure. It is a simple and appropriate way to deal with it.I also believe we should promote the existing system of home care and home help for elderly people who are somewhat, but not fully, independent. At a professional level, we require a more peripatetic health service. It already exists but we must build on it. Many elderly people are happy to stay in their homes. They might be able to do 80% of what they need to do themselves and support from family and the State will remove further pressure. The four suggestions I have made should be acted on. There must be more nursing home places, tax credits for certain payments, promotion of home care support and promotion of a peripatetic service from professionals who help the elderly.The most significant aspect of the judgment, and Senator Ryan will probably discuss this further, is that the real difficulty was not retrospection but private property. That article of the Constitution dealing with private property has caused many problems. I heard the Taoiseach speaking about trying to impose some discipline on developers who are buying up land around this city, thereby driving up the cost of building houses and creating problems for home owners and first time buyers. This relates back to the article on private property, which is the most restrictive constitutional provision on private property in the constitutions of which I am aware.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	193	It has never been tested against the common good provision.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	194	That is the issue. The common good must also be there to balance the provision on private property. We have seen what has happened with housing. Developers can afford to buy huge tracts of land and release them in dribs and drabs for development, with the consequence of corrupting the law of supply and demand by reducing supply and increasing prices. That is not in the common good and I believe the people who drafted the Constitution did not have it in mind.However, in this case, that provision of the Constitution protected elderly people and I welcome that fact. What we were doing was wrong because there was no discipline, control or regulation of it. We were simply taking everything. If we had passed a legal measure, as we now intend to do, whereby there would be a legal basis for doing it, there would have been no difficulty.We need to move on repayment and to do it efficiently. We put a great deal of pressure on the banks to repay their customers when they overcharged them. Pressure was put on the banks to take the initiative to find out who was overcharged, where those people lived now and to pay them back. It is crucial in this situation that the Department goes to the trouble of finding out who was overcharged or incorrectly charged and repays them or their estate. Although Senator Glynn will probably be correct about many cases, that money is already lost. Let us repay this money and move on.I wish to make two final points. First, I noted the Tánaiste's comment that she will not blame her immediate predecessor and does not expect him to shoulder the blame when the report is complete. That is important. As I said earlier, it should not be a party political issue. It has been in existence for the past 20 years and all Ministers and public servants will have to share responsibility for it. However, if we discover that somebody told the Minister that this is an issue that had to be dealt with because it was illegal, unconstitutional or however it was phrased, questions will have to be asked and somebody will have to be answerable. That is the way it should be. That is what we elect people to do.This will cost a great deal of money. The Tánaiste said in another venue that this money will not be taken from the health budget. She told us today that the Supreme Court concluded that €0.5 billion was not a hugely significant amount in the context of the €11 billion spent annually on health. She accepted that point. Either the Tánaiste or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, said recently that this €500 million will be supplied from a source other than the health budget. Perhaps the Tánaiste will confirm that point.

The Minister of State, Deputy Power, will act as an effective conduit of the views of the Seanad. I agreed with much of what Senator Glynn said.Senator O'Toole suggested a tax credit, which is a good idea. I was involved in the rescue of a small old persons' home in Dublin. It had not been charging enough. It was run by a committee of well-intentioned people but they were not in touch with commercial realities and got into commercial difficulty. We went in and with the help of Ms Ann Byrne, former programme manager to Deputy Howlin, they received a subvention from the local authorities. Mr. Bob Joyce then put together a plan whereby people could gain tax relief by covenanting, which saved the place. Therefore, the idea is an extremely good one.Governments are far too pusillanimous in respect of the Constitution in that they have never really tested the concept of the common good. In the present circumstances, if this was tested, the common good provisions would prevail.I am interested in considering the welfare of elderly people, in which I now have a substantial vested interest. I congratulate the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, on taking up this job which is a poisoned chalice, although I am sorry she is not present to hear me say so. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, formerly described the Department of Health and Children as "Angola", a place where unexpected detonations occur from previously unsuspected landmines. Goodness knows, this has shown itself to be the case. However, even the ex-master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, who is very critical of the health service, when speaking on radio had words of praise for the Tánaiste and hoped she would be able to clear up the administrative difficulties. There is much waste in this area, which I have no problem stating. I am glad our benches are not trying to play political football with the issue.I strongly support the Minister and understand why this situation existed. However, I have heard unpleasant things said on radio in recent days. Some people telephoned to say they believed they have an unexpected nest egg, although at least some of these people did not kill themselves looking after their elderly relatives. This is a nasty and avaricious way to behave. One repeatedly encounters the compensation issue. The first little breach is like blood in the water — then the piranhas come out. When listening to the speakers on radio the day before yesterday, I was reminded of the late John Kelly, when he inverted Joyce's phrase about Ireland being the old sow that ate her farrow and said that, nowadays, we are in danger of the old sow being devoured by her cannibal piglets. An element of this arises.On the other hand, I listened with immense respect to a woman who telephoned a radio station. She and her elderly mother did not have much money and her mother was taken into care by the State. The woman stated she could never thank the institution's staff enough for the wonderful care her mother received. She had no intention of taking action against the State. I absolutely honour and respect that person. That is the way we should approach our society, although none of us really does. It is a body corporate. We take elements that may be of use. It would be a Swiftian irony if money was drained out of the health budget and this affected the most vulnerable people, namely, the elderly.The pension serves to provide food, shelter and some small element of luxury and well-being. By taking people into care, the State provides the shelter and food. I do not know why people feel this should be done twice as a person in that situation is receiving the same advantage twice. There is a question mark in at least some circumstances in regard to action being taken against the State to recover money that was not intended for this purpose when it might be taken away from those in more vulnerable circumstances.I will use this opportunity to record what I feel. I recently got into a bit of a controversy with a distinguished medical person. The security guard at my local supermarket was concerned about his mother's condition at St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park. I wrote the usual letter on his behalf and got a snotty letter back. Incivilities were exchanged for about a week before I replied saying that as we had finished our period of incivility, I would like to help in any way I could, if conditions were difficult.I visited the hospital and found that its consultant geriatrician was a very decent man. I saw the circumstances in which staff, who are heroic, are working. They operate in a building which was not designed as a hospital but as a military academy, the Royal Hibernian Military Academy, before becoming a hospital for Army personnel in the time of the Free State. It was not designed as a hospital but is an 18th century building. There are many outlying buildings in the grounds, including two very fine churches, one Anglican and one Roman Catholic. However, the condition of the building is poor in some sections, although it is kept scrupulously clean. One of the rooms, for example, was a former swimming pool when it was the Army hospital. It was filled in with concrete but the roof of the building has collapsed. It is like a factory and there is evidence of rot. It is inappropriate.On one ward, 30 patients were separated by dividers that did not go up to the ceiling, allowing perfect conditions for the spread of the winter vomiting bug through airborne infection. There was a pong that would blind Sinn Féin because there is only one lavatory for the 30 patients, which is not wheelchair accessible and has no hoists. Moreover, the windows are halfway up the walls, no doubt designed to stop the children in the Hibernian academy looking out during geography lessons. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff working in these conditions.How lovely it would be for these elderly patients, at the end of their lives, to at least have a view of a park they may no longer be able to visit. Nonetheless, enormous strides have been taken. For example, Dr. Power has organised a minibus for those who do not have cars. If they can get to the gates of the Phoenix Park, they can telephone the minibus and it will go to the relevant gate and collect them. In addition, the patients have greenhouses. This is marvellous and really inventive because elderly and wheelchair bound patients can get their hands into the soil and watch plants grow, which gives them hope. However, they are hit again by the cap on staff recruitment in the Civil Service.I am not against people receiving nest eggs. God knows I do the lottery every week and hope to get a huge nest egg. I cannot understand those who say €2 million is too much; it is not half enough, I could do with €4 million. However, I would hate to think that people in a mean-spirited way would seize the opportunity to profit from parents they did not support to the extent one would expect in terms of looking after them during their life. By so doing, they might take away from the necessary funding to revamp an institution where elderly people live in inappropriate circumstances.

For the purpose of clarity, I wish to record my congratulations to the Tánaiste on the way she approached her responsibilities as a Minister and member of Cabinet. After a few weeks in office, this situation was brought to her attention by Deputies Perry and Kenny. She sought advice, addressed the Dáil, put the documents on the record of that House and set about a course of action. She appointed Mr. Travers to conduct a report and, in the short term, brought forward legislation to protect the situation that prevails, as well as considering what had occurred in the previous 20 plus years.I welcome the Supreme Court ruling of 16 February. We now have clarity on a situation which was unclear for many years. This has been brought about in a relatively short time after the matter was brought to the attention of the Tánaiste. I am glad the Government progressed in the way it did because the manner in which the Supreme Court ruling was brought about is healthier for this country than if we had to wait many months for an individual or motive case to be brought in light of what occurred in November. The State has been done a service in this regard. The responsibility of office holders is to protect the State and its citizens. Regardless of the views of non-office holders, when one is in office, one has responsibilities. The Tánaiste has shown very clearly that she faces her responsibilities in a decisive manner.There is no doubt that the elderly are a valued part of society. Recent suggestions in the media and by some political commentators that this was wilful neglect and a robbing of the elderly by the Tánaiste are harsh, unfair and untrue. This type of cheap political points scoring does not serve this community or the elderly fairly.There are examples of people suffering severe hardships trying to meet payments that were required to facilitate their elderly relatives in nursing homes, but Senators Norris and O'Toole made valuable points. People are given pensions intended to sustain them and to provide comfort and shelter for them. If this responsibility is taken on by the State, it is not unreasonable to expect that they will make a contribution. In recent years, people saw fit to put this point into practice to extremes, but we now have clarification on the matter.Many of the institutions are providing excellent care for our elderly. There are many families that have moved away from the old situation of having three generations in one house as society changed. There are people who must place their elderly parents in homes due to their circumstances. Many elderly people are grateful for the companionship, care and so forth that they receive, but they do not expect all of this free of charge. If they have the means to contribute and pay towards that care, they are happy to do so.I agree with the point that we now find ourselves with green-eyed monsters and cash registers clicking in people's eyes. This worries me. Senator Norris eloquently described people ringing in to radio shows that he has listened to with different points of view about nest eggs or their gratitude for the care their parents received. I, too, have spoken with both sides of the argument. I wonder if people who saw a nest egg of pounds, shillings and pence — or the euro, I should say — and now seek to cash in, paid equal attention to looking after the elderly members of their families. People have given me a message for the Tánaiste to the effect that they were satisfied with the care their parents received, that they will not pursue a case against the State and that, if it is the case that they are entitled to money, they will donate it to the very institution that looked after their mother or father. I congratulate this type of person.However, I am in no way suggesting that those people who are entitled to be paid, suffered a hardship or had to dispose of family assets, do not warrant compensation. Of course they do but, as in every situation, there will be extremes on either side and common ground in the middle. I hope the common ground in this situation will prevail. When there were severe cuts in Government spending in the 1980s, the amounts of money involved were nothing compared to the amounts we are now proposing to take out of the spending power of the Government to provide services across the board. As citizens and individuals, we should all hope that common sense and the common ground of those who express their views will prevail and that we will discharge our responsibilities well.I welcome the establishment by the Government of a sub-committee to work through the mechanisms to accomplish and deliver this payment. I hope that, at the end of the day, we are not in a scenario in which the legal profession gets too involved, where much money is expended by the State and matters conclude in an unnecessary fashion. People will benefit to the detriment of the provision of services.There is a system in this country wherein the Oireachtas, the Government and the courts combine in ensuring that our democracy is upheld. In this particular case, the system has been shown to work. I concur with previous speakers such as Senator O'Toole that it is unfair to point the finger of blame at the current Minister for shouldering the responsibility and for implementing these charges. The evidence, as provided to date and which I hope will be substantiated further by Mr. Travers' report at the end of February 2005, is that this practice was spread equally over 11 Governments. The Travers report will throw light on what happened within the Department and raise many questions that must be answered. In reality, not only has the Government faced up to the responsibilities of the Supreme Court decision, but it must do so in regard to Mr. Travers' report and taking the appropriate actions to determine where the shortfall in administration of this debacle took place. The Tánaiste will act with the same degree of decisiveness as she has acted in her short number of months in office.I welcome the tenor of this debate and the points that have been made. The important people in this are our elderly citizens. They are valued members of society and must be treated fairly and with dignity. At the end of this process, I hope we will have repaired whatever deficiencies existed in the manner in which the elderly have been perceived by certain sections of society. Let us hope that common sense prevails and that those people who have an entitlement are compensated. It is important that a system is put in place to ensure that this compensation is brought forward and that will not allow the legal professional or individuals turn this into another debacle and divert moneys from other services for their personal greed.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I welcome the Minister of State. He is from the same part of the country as I am. I will be careful and declare an interest. My mother has been for about two years a resident in a public hospital for elderly people in Athy, where she receives care that can only be described as superb. I am personally more than a little uncomfortable at the prospect of a substantial sum of money which I had no great objection to being deducted from her income being returned to her. There are other members of my family so I will not make silly statements about what should or should not be done with the money but no one can rationally object in principle to people who get the quality of care that I have seen given to elderly people making a contribution. The idea that this care would be provided by the State and that the children of a person receiving that care could sit back and anticipate a large sum of money provided by the accumulated income of the elderly person is not something I would support.There is a need for balance. In this country we need a guarantee that when old people need proper institutional care, it can be provided for them at a high quality and within a system which does not threaten to bankrupt their families and is not essentially determined by income. A number of Senators adverted to greedy people who may be queueing up. There may well be some such people. I do not think that anyone who articulately defends the profit motive should ever be too shocked when greed manifests itself in other areas. However, I have also seen extraordinary quality of care of elderly parents by children over years and we should not leave that off the record.I have a couple of questions which I would like some Minister to answer. Was the Government advised by the Attorney General that the legislation subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court was constitutional? I do not know of any lawyer outside the Attorney General's office who had much doubt that the legislation was in all probability unconstitutional. Funnily enough, I do not share Senator O'Toole's view on the property provisions of our Constitution. They have been used as an excuse by governments for not doing things. Although the Supreme Court accepted the 20% provision of social and affordable housing, it has always said than an uneven and unfair attack on some people's property rights, which is not based on a fair position, is not legitimate. The property clause of our Constitution has never been an issue. What has been at issue is the conservatism of various Governments who have used it.There is a more fundamental question involved. How did something like this happen? I agree that it is not fair to suggest it is all the fault of the Tánaiste, nor is it fair to suggest it was all the fault of the previous Minister, or of the Minister before that. What is of immediate concern is how this was allowed to run on after the Ombudsman sometime in 2002 produced a long, detailed report on another aspect of nursing home subventions, out of which the Department of Health and Children comes very badly. I will cite small parts of it to make it clear what the Ombudsman of the time said. He indicated a Department that was not functioning properly, which was indifferent to or in some cases ignorant of the law and which on one occasion decided that there was no point in telling health boards that a particular regulation was illegal because they would have no money to remedy the illegality, so it was better not to tell them at all.This report was issued three years ago. I will give a flavour of it. The Department was criticised for many things and was given the opportunity to reply. One of the Department's more astonishing assertions was to dispute the view that the health Acts convey a legally enforceable entitlement to hospital inpatient services. The Department got involved in what I can only describe as a Jesuitical distinction between eligibility and entitlement, which the Ombudsman correctly rejected. A succession of such comments about the Department and how it dealt with things runs through the report.Page 71 of the report gives a further flavour. In a general address about the system, the Ombudsman talks of the difficulties the Houses of the Oireachtas face in attempting to monitor the growing mountain of regulations and other secondary legislation, the weakness of the links between the two separate legislative processes and the difficulties faced by Members of the Oireachtas in feeding into the administration in a formal way their concerns and those brought to their attention by their constituents. All through this report——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I am quoting from the report on nursing home subventions, An Investigation by the Ombudsman of Complaints regarding Payment of Nursing Home Subventions by Health Boards. I apologise for not giving the name of the report. It was an omission on my part.I will quote further from the report because there is a point which needs to be made. In the last paragraph on page 68 the Ombudsman states that he had already raised the issue of what appears to be a growing practice within Departments whereby Ministers tend not to put their views or instructions explicitly in writing: "The views of the Minister may be conveyed verbally or via his or her private secretary", and so on. The Ombudsman was identifying precisely the mess now inherited by the Tánaiste.In the following paragraph there is a suggestion of humour about the dialogue the Ombudsman notes between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, one of my favourite bêtes noire in this House: “This clearly falls into the category of controllers talking to the controls. As often happens, this dialogue was concerned largely with post hoc damage limitation so far as the financial costs were concerned.” The report continues in that vein with the Department of Health and Children being accused of extraordinary delays. I recall that the Ombudsman wrote to the Department in the middle of one year and it was nearly October of the following year when the Department responded.The fundamental problem regarding this issue is that it appears the Department of Health and Children is so badly managed that it cannot even ensure that it operates within the law and that it deals with the statutorily appointed Ombudsman looking after consumer complaints. It appears that it cannot even give advice to health boards, or could not, about what was legal or illegal and that it got itself involved in the most convoluted reasoning in trying to explain what was absolutely unjustifiable. That is what I hope the Travers report will identify — how we are to organise a management system in that huge Department which is based on transparency, accountability and the law and where regulations are not turned inside out in the interests of meeting budgetary targets. No one is saying, however, that the service should be provided without a contribution from users.The Department of Health and Children introduced a blanket provision relating to medical cards for people over 70. My party made a fuss about this at the time but I am of the opinion that it was a good idea. However, the Department introduced the provision without a proper analysis of the current costs. Cognisance was not taken either of future costs, particularly regarding the fact that everyone over 70 would have an entitlement, as of right, to nursing home care because they possessed medical cards. I do not know how the Department, having been warned by the Ombudsman about sloppy interpretation of legislation and the need for clarity, managed to avoid reflecting on this issue and the dodgy nature of some of the things that occurred, particularly after it was issued with a 90-page report by the Ombudsman three years ago.This matter involved money being taken from people and extraordinary practices. However, it also involved a view that it would be easier to do this — I do not make my comments in a political way — to people who are vulnerable, less articulate and less able to defend themselves than it would be if one tried to do it to those who young, vigorous and in the whole of their health. If it had been done to younger people, protests would have arisen so fast that action would have been taken.When they enter nursing homes, most elderly people are, by and large, glad to be there because their health has deteriorated and their children are mightily relieved that their parents will be cared for in a proper manner. The last thing anybody is going to do is raise a fuss. That is why it is the function of law officers, the Office of the Attorney General and the law officers of health boards to offer scrupulous, detached and dispassionate legal advice. It is manifestly clear that such legal advice would have immediately indicated that, under the existing legislation, money for payment for the services being offered could not be deducted from anybody in possession of a medical card and that they would be entitled to such services without payment.The policy to which I refer may be unwise and there is, in my view, a case to be made in that regard. On two occasions during the past three to four years, however, it has focused attention on the fact that this is a not so glamorous area of health care and that is going to become an expanding consumer of the resources of any health budget as a result of the need to provide proper and dignified support for an increasingly aging population. If we do not address this matter and continue to deal with it in the way, as outlined in the Ombudsman's report, the Department tackled its problems, we will end up with a succession of messes. If the Government decides that we cannot afford to make provision for the elderly, it should be indicated in explicit terms that people will not get State subventions. I hope it does not make such a decision because it would be cruel to do so.To pretend to operate a system of universal eligibility while imposing charges here, restrictions there and quantitative restrictions somewhere else is to fly in the face of good policy-making. This issue is about people who have been misled and who had money taken from them without there being a proper legal basis for doing so. It was inevitable that the Supreme Court would find they are entitled to have this money returned to them. The State will incur huge costs in doing so. I hope the lesson will be learned, now and forever, and that every Government Department will give consideration to regulations which involve money and costs and ensure that their practice is consistent with legal advice. Where they are not sure this is the case, they should be encouraged to seek legal advice in order that another mess of this kind will not arise.The Ombudsman's report to which I referred earlier showed that there was already a mess in the Department of Health and Children. This mess should have been sorted out but that was not the case. As a result, we are now faced with an even bigger mess. I hope that, on this occasion, the structures in the Department of Health and Children will be sorted out and that other Departments will be found out in respect of their charges. It is only a matter of time until somebody challenges the so-called local contribution charged by primary schools. People are entitled to free primary education under the Constitution. How is it possible then to justifiably extract a payment from people for their children's education? I am merely issuing a warning in that regard.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Supreme Court's decision in respect of the Bill. I am glad the debate has, with one or two exceptions, been well balanced. Senator McHugh is smiling so that may be about to change.The Supreme Court decided that the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 is constitutional in some respects. The court agreed that the Bill was justified in making charges in the future but not justified in imposing charges retrospectively. In my opinion, new legislation will be required in respect of the imposition of charges in the future. The decision of the Supreme Court, following the Bill's referral to it by the President, has at least brought legal clarity to the situation. A poorly administered system, under, as other Members stated, various Governments of all hues, has been in place since 1976. We will now have to change it.The Minister yesterday announced the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with the issue of compensation for those who were incorrectly charged. I have no doubt that this sub-committee will arrive at a solution which will be fair to those who were wrongly charged and to those currently paying tax. The health budget consumes an enormous amount of taxpayers' money and is under immense strain. People must realise that Exchequer funds are not unlimited. Potential figures for compensation ranging from €500 million to €2 billion have been mentioned by various parties. The Tánaiste indicated that up to 2,750 people may have been affected. It must be remembered that amounts of this magnitude must be found by cutting expenditure in other important areas, not least the existing health budget. I am glad it has been indicated, in a press release or newspaper report, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, intends to make a once-off payment. This will, I hope, help to resolve matters.While it is incumbent on us to ensure that elderly people are adequately compensated for being incorrectly overcharged, we must also try to ensure that the nation's finances are not put at risk. This is a problem which has been contributed to by all Governments since the days of Liam Cosgrave and Brendan Corish. Like Senator Ryan, I am of the view that it is unfair to lay the blame at the door of any Government or on the shoulders of any Minister. We must try to find an equitable solution. We must devise a reasonable system of compensation for people who have been overcharged. This must be done in a manner which prevents the future enrichment of the legal profession at their expense and that of the general taxpayer. The Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 and the Supreme Court judgment have brought some clarity to a long-running, confused and unsatisfactory situation. I have the utmost faith in the ability of the Tánaiste and the Cabinet sub-committee and I know they will come back with recommendations on a system of compensation that is not alone honest and transparent but, most important, avoids a plethora of court actions.The Supreme Court judgment has brought about a climate in which it is timely to look at the wider debate as to how elderly people are to be looked after. After all, these are the people who have given us what we have today, and it is only right that they be looked after. I believe it is the view of every citizen that this should be properly handled so as not to rob the Exchequer of every penny.I was impressed by what Senators Norris and Minihan had to say about people they knew that had elderly relatives in nursing homes who did not need any money back from the State. They would be prepared to invest any rebates in the homes that had looked after their elderly relatives. However, there are people who find it financially difficult when paying for their elderly relatives in care who would welcome whatever compensation is paid. It is right that the moneys are repaid in such cases, bearing in mind the wider picture in terms of the Exchequer's coffers.Through the Minister of State, I wish the Tánaiste well with her sub-committee. I know whatever it does will be for the benefit of us all.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I commend Deputies Kenny and Perry on raising this matter. It is indicative of an effective Opposition that has been working well in the past two years and a team of people who are getting ready to enter Government. It is a good omen for a team that will be capable and professional, when in Government.As regards the remuneration of moneys owed to people who were otherwise charged illegally, it is important that the public has confidence in what is being done. If there is to be a remuneration in excess of €1 billion, it is important that the litigators do not take a surplus of what is available. That is to be welcomed.Senator Minihan mentioned that the Tánaiste has done a good job since this issue was highlighted. She had no choice. It is as simple as that. She had to do a good job. An illegal technicality was identified and she had no choice. It is important that the public has confidence in the disbursement of moneys to the people from whom it was taken, illegitimately. A wider debate should be mandatory as regards care of the elderly and it is incumbent on us as legislators to begin that debate. Perhaps this is a watershed as regards opening a debate on the elderly. It is certain, however, that there is a serious equality issue as regards care of the elderly.The symbolism of an elderly person handing over his or her pension book to either a private or public nursing home is disturbing. Such a practice is inequitable and wrong. I am in total agreement that one has to pay for services, but to require the handing over of a pension book to a public or private body is to treat people discriminately and this must be addressed. To give an example, there would be uproar if we were to insist that parents hand over their children's allowance for pre-school care or require people to surrender their unemployment assistance to go on courses. People would not accept that. There would be a revolution if we started to demand unemployment assistance from the unemployed or the children's allowance from parents. Equally, it is wrong to ask people who have worked relentlessly and tirelessly in this State over the years, the elderly, to hand over their pension books and we have a serious inequality issue as a result.If elderly people are functionally dependent or have cognitive needs that need taking care of, they cannot be treated differently from any other citizen. They still have to be treated on an equal basis. As a practical example, I will ask the Minister of State, through the Chair, how he would feel on his retirement, if he had to hand over his Oireachtas pension to some authorities, and it was taken away from him week by week and he never saw a penny of it.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Joking aside, there is an issue regarding the symbolic nature of handing over moneys in the form of a pension, assistance or an entitlement to a private or public body. Leaving the Minister of State's spouse or family to one side, I believe it is wrong and there is a serious equality issue to be addressed.As regards access and funding there is need for a comprehensive debate on private and public nursing homes. On the east coast there are many elderly people in high income brackets who are holding out to get into public community nursing homes. They are holding out, in certain instances, because they do not want to go into private nursing homes. If one is paying €800 a week to a private nursing home and, let us say, the subvention is €680, down the line the cost of care may increase but the subvention may stay the same. There are problems and concerns in that regard.There should be equal assessment between community homes and private homes. One is not financially assessed in a public nursing home whereas one is assessed in a private home. Anomalies exist between the treatment of public and private nursing home patients, which must also be addressed.As regards transparency, we have an ever-expanding elderly population base and they have to be taken care of. We must look at different avenues for treating them on an equal basis and for moving forward on the equality issue. Before Christmas I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, an issue regarding the 21 day rule for patients in private nursing homes. Senator Leyden will be aware of this as he was present. If an elderly person breaks a leg and has to convalesce in a community nursing home, the person will have to pay after 21 days. That is a discrimination issue, because someone in a public hospital may stay longer than 21 days but will not have to pay.The debate on how nursing homes have been developed has not been addressed and we need to look at this. In the past, we had public and private nursing homes. Private nursing homes were successful due to the fact that they were family led. I am aware of many private nursing homes across Ireland which have been family led. They have been a success story.

It is rather difficult to make a contribution when one is being interrupted.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	212	We must address the fundamentals of investment in nursing homes. At present a developer-led syndicate is driving construction which is opposed to the type of private nursing home that we had for years, which was family led and gave credibility to the sector. However, at present, syndicates of rich, successful businessmen are getting tax-breaks to feed into the construction and operation of nursing homes. This is an ethical issue because it is detaching the family run element and it allows outsiders to come into the sector. They have to provide for a matron who may not have an emotional attachment to the nursing home.I have tried to make three important points today. The first is in regard to equality and how we treat older people. We all live in Peter Pan's world and we think we will not get old. When I get old — I do not know when will be the cut-off point, perhaps it will be when I reach 100 years of age — I would like to be treated the same as every other citizen in this country. The second point deals with the transparency between the community nursing homes and the private nursing homes and the financial assessment of each. The third point——

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I welcome the Minister of State to the House, as well as the Tánaiste's statement earlier this afternoon. She has handled this whole business properly and with integrity. She has done what one should do when one discovers a mess that is not of one's own making. She took advice and she took remedial action. The Bill was struck down after the Supreme Court was consulted and she will bring forward new proposals in the light of that.This saga, which affects the rights of our citizens and especially our elderly and more vulnerable citizens, shows that a parliamentary and constitutional system works. The system of parliamentary accountability contributed to the Bill being brought forward in December. It was correct that every precaution be taken and that a Bill affecting people's rights be referred to the Supreme Court, especially given the limited capacity of the people affected to take legal action. We have a system in this State where the President can exercise a veto on legislation following constitutional advice, and has a duty to do so. That worked well in this instance. I can understand the decision of the Supreme Court and the reasons given. I have not heard anyone say that the Supreme Court got it wrong.There will be an investigation on how the legal doubts were ignored over the past 28 years. A couple of points need to be made on that subject.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	218	At least a couple.

As we can see in the courts on all manner of matters, an arguable legal case can be constructed in defence of any proposition or in casting doubt thereon. It would be a brave person who could absolutely guarantee that all legislation and regulations are constitutional in every respect. The real world does not work like that. The health service is always faced with enormous financial pressures. It is understandable, but not necessarily pardonable, that people under annual pressure from the Department of Finance had no particular appetite to explore avenues that might cost a great deal of money. Having said that, we must face up to these situations. If justice requires us to spend €500 million or the best part of €1 billion, then we have to do that. We are fortunately in a financially strong position today.Today's statement could be regarded as an interim statement, but it seemed to suggest that compensation would be given in respect of the last six years. In the case of long-stay patients such as those with mental incapacity, it would go back further. I was a little surprised and disappointed to hear the Tánaiste say that records in some of these places are very incomplete. The State should require proper record keeping in these institutions. As we have seen with institutions for children and young people, it is imperative to keep proper records in case unanticipated queries arise at some future date. A provision in this regard should be included in the Bill.In the more numerous category of elderly people entering care, relatively few people will have a stay which lasts for many years. I accept Senator McHugh's point that families in many cases have made considerable sacrifices. We must balance payments to estates to reimburse expenditure which occurred a considerable number of years ago with the pressing needs of the health and other social services today. I appreciate that the balance which must be struck will be a matter of some debate.Like most Members, I have some little vicarious experience of nursing homes to the extent that I have visited friends or relatives from time to time. Facilities range from the very comfortable and even superb to those with which one does not feel wholly at ease. The sector will undoubtedly grow. I spoke recently to the chairman of a hospital about the problems of accident and emergency services. He made the point that many people in nursing homes should be dealt with by primary care, which needs to be developed, while others should be in step-down facilities. It is clear that we must develop services further.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I welcome the Tánaiste's remarks in the House today as it was necessary for her to make a clear statement on the issue. We must, however, view matters in the context of the circumstances in which she found herself. She is part of a Government with collective responsibility for the scenario in which many people find themselves now.Many Members spoke of the need for a balanced debate and a reference was made to the launching of Scud missiles by the Opposition. The use of emotive terms fails to acknowledge the reality that illegal deductions were made and demands were put on people over a period of 27 years while successive Governments failed to take action to provide redress. The issue would not have come to a head as soon as it did had it not been for the Government's stroke mentality which prompted it to provide medical cards to all persons aged 70 years and over. We know now that the provision is impossible as a result of which the Government has reneged on it. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, can clarify that matter for the House. Had it not been for Deputies Perry and Kenny, who worked persistently to highlight the problem, notice would not have been taken of it.Reference has been made to inconsistency. In early December, the Taoiseach said the legislation to be brought forward would not have retrospective effect and that it was never the case that legislation had a retrospective character. A few days later, we found that the Tánaiste had been poorly advised and brought forward retrospectively effective legislation which was subsequently challenged and, happily, thrown out. As I have recorded previously, on 16 December the Tánaiste, as Minister for Health and Children, said it was clearly beyond the Government's financial and administrative ability to repay all the charges accumulated since 1976. She proceeded to announce a €2,000 advance payment as a token of what might be due. Everything about this scenario speaks of uncertainty and confusion.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	222	On the same date, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, said the charges were accepted policy and that no one had said anything about it for 50 years. Deputy Martin owes an apology to the many people Senator Mansergh and many other speakers have mentioned. As Minister for Health and Children he was told about the problem but he walked away and washed his hands of it. When Ministers turn away from their responsibilities it is no wonder that circumstances like those in which we find ourselves arise.Senator Norris said he heard people making complaints on radio. He said people had called into programmes to ask if they were entitled to what the Senator called a nest egg. The Senator said it was nasty to hear that the people in question were queuing for compensation in keeping with a compensation syndrome. I remind Senator Norris that the deductions were illegal and involved people who, in many cases, could ill afford to pay the charges in question. To suggest that the people who draw down the compensatory payment are seeking to acquire a nest egg will lead to circumstances in which people have no recourse but to take legal action to obtain a refund of illegal deductions. I agree with the Tánaiste that we should avoid the legal route if at all possible. I hope she administers the scheme quickly to avoid a scenario in which it is necessary for people to have recourse to the law to obtain refunds.The example of a person who said he or she would return to a nursing home the refund he or she expects to receive was referred to during the debate. It is fine for someone who can afford it to take that step and I hope those who are of that frame of mind will do so to facilitate the upgrading of public hospitals to provide extra comfort to patients.The Tánaiste failed to indicate whether the Minister for Finance was correct to say that the provision of compensation will inevitably lead to cuts. Can the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, clarify the matter? The Minister for Finance failed to specify whether the cuts would be made to the health budget or across the board, although he clarified matters somewhat after he realised his mistake when someone reminded him of the seriousness of his statement. If these funds must be found, will it result in cutbacks in the Department of Health and Children or across all Departments? The Tánaiste went on the record in December to say that it is administratively impossible to grant compensation to all. There is confusion in the minds of those entitled to a refund. Despite opportunities in both Houses, clarity has not been forthcoming from any Minister making a statement on the matter.Situations arose where people were refused access to public hospitals and there was nowhere else for them to go but to the private hospitals. Senator McHugh and others have often mentioned the hardship experienced by families forced to sell their property, the home that they built up over the years, in order to finance such hospital stays. Hopefully we will get clarity from whichever Minister might take the responsibility. However, it is important that somebody provides clarity. As a result of the confusion, people and their representatives are going to their solicitors and saying, "Will you find out the details for us?" That is the start of the legal process which would be unnecessary if there was clarity from the Minister.It is absolutely essential the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, apologises for what he did, because he knew about it and walked away from the problem. He can possibly exonerate the Tánaiste and present Minister. He did not care about the hardship endured by so many and it is now time that he stood up and clarified the situation and apologised to those people——

This was the policy of 11 Governments and 40 health boards, but we now have clarity regarding the law, certainty about payments and confidence in the way we can proceed.The Government welcomes the Supreme Court decision and the clarity it brings. People in long-term care, as well as their families, will also welcome this clarity. They now know what has been obscure for 29 years, namely, whether and on what basis they should contribute towards certain costs. Together with the Government and the Oireachtas, people will be confident that the continuation of the policy of contributions towards shelter and maintenance is not only fair, but also constitutional.We are a society ruled by law, and it must be so and remain so in every detail of public policy and administration. The decision also demonstrates that our institutions of State work. We can only achieve the confidence and clarity that citizens of a State ruled by law deserve when the Government, the Oireachtas and the courts address issues clearly, exercise their powers and meet their responsibilities. Problems arise when real issues are not addressed, when basic problems are finessed or fudged and when policies are not fully grounded in law.Since the issue was raised, the Government has to ascertain the precise legal position and to put policy on a sound legal footing. It accepted the responsibility to deal with a 29-year legal problem, and has acted to do so. The Oireachtas played its part, as did the Council of State, the President and the Supreme Court. The fundamental failure that has been corrected is the failure to properly implement a 29 year old Supreme Court decision. The delay is deeply regrettable, but the resolution is extremely welcome.Everybody is now in a position to study the Supreme Court ruling in detail. The Government has acted responsibly and reasonably since the Attorney General provided legal advice on the matter last November. It brought forward the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in order to put the charges on a sound legal footing. The Government realised that whichever way it addressed the issue of retrospective payments, other than by the course of action taken in the Bill, individual legal challenges were likely. Older people in long-term care and their families would have endured the stress of months of legal argument.The Government could not have acted quicker or in a better manner to achieve the clarity we have today. Had it decided to make payments back for one year, claims would have been made for payments for two years or more. Had it decided to make payments for two years, claims would have been made for three. Even if the Government had decided to make repayments within the timeframe of the Statute of Limitations, the decision would most likely have also been tested. The Bill has been tested in a manner which is the quickest, most effective, most cost-efficient and least burdensome on those in long-term care and their families. This is why the Government welcomed the President's decision to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court. As the Taoiseach said in the House, the Government gave the President advice to this effect at the Council of State, fully respecting her absolute discretion on the matter.There was simply no easy way to deal with the long-standing legal problem about which the Attorney General advised us. There was considerable uncertainty at that time regarding the extent of legal advice given since the Supreme Court judgment of 1976. As a result, Mr. John Travers will carry out a thorough investigation into how the issue was handled over the years by the Department of Health and Children.Had the Government waited to legislate until it knew everything, we would not have been in any better a position than now, especially those in long-term care. We would still be many months away from legal clarity. Litigation or challenges would have been inevitable whenever it took action. This source of funding available to our health services would also still be in doubt. The situation would have remained very unsatisfactory.No one in the House suggested an easy way forward last November. Few seemed to remember the policy of charging for shelter and maintenance was supported and implemented by 11 Governments and many health boards, of which many Deputies and Senators were members. Since 1976 no political party ever took a stance or sought a mandate to remove these charges. If political parties assign political blame, it must surely be on an inclusive basis since 1976.Many Governments served and implemented the policy. It is only fair that all political parties which participated in these Governments take some responsibility in the matter.Whatever way the Government proceeds, it is important that those owed money are repaid as quickly as possible without having to take legal recourse. We should strive to ensure they are refunded the charges they duly deserve.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	235	This is a political nightmare. We require the impossible, namely, reasonable and mature debate. The situation is ready-made for an irresponsible Opposition, because a mistake has been made by a Government and the person left holding the parcel when the music stops gets the blame which explodes in her face. It is wrong that the Government should suffer the kind of political attacks it has received over this matter. It was not in any sense the fault of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, that the Government was landed in this situation.It is regrettable, albeit inevitable, that for several reasons the matter should have become a political football. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the issue of old people handing over their pension books and money being taken from them has been going on since at least 1976. We will never know whether everybody noticed it and said nothing, or nobody noticed it, or some people noticed it and drew it to the attention of various Ministers. We do know, however, that it has been going on for nearly 30 years while Ministers of various political hues were in office. In this country, Ministers for Health tend to present a roll of honour, which in other circumstances would be very honourable, but it is absurd to begin attributing blame to anyone for this matter. It would be political opportunism to blame the Tánaiste. It does not stick.Children and the elderly represent two groups in society which are extraordinarily vulnerable and from whom it is easy to make political capital. As speakers on the Government side have said, the elderly are going to become a focus for great debate in the years to come because there will be many more of them. As their numbers grow they will have more voting power, will attract more consideration than they have been used to and will form pressure groups. Such lobbying groups will be successful because they will carry greater numbers than heretofore, and their members will be more articulate and will live longer.The proposed compensation scheme has become a political football, which is a pity. However, the political argument can be defused by acknowledging the fact that the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has tackled this problem in a fairly forthright way. On 16 December, in a remarkably honest statement, she said the Government could not pay all the amounts that had accumulated since 1976. She then agreed to pay what turned out to be a token amount of €2,000. After that, the legislation was referred by the President to the Supreme Court and we have come across a situation which is a complete and utter mess. It is an entanglement from which it will be difficult to emerge.We should thank the President for having referred the Bill to the Supreme Court and for fulfilling the primary duty for which she is elected. The Government may already regret the endorsement it gave her because she has caused a great deal of headache but that is exactly why she is there. She should be congratulated.Senator Norris pointed to a practical problem that will now emerge, which is that we are a pretty sceptical and cynical nation when it comes to dealing with a big pot of money. It is essential that all those who are injured, damaged, ill treated and have had money taken from them should be compensated, as well as the heirs of those who are deceased. Some will have paid money for the upkeep of their relatives, which they did not have to pay. When sums as great as €1 billion are being spoken of, however, there is a danger that people who were inconsiderate to their elderly relatives and contributed nothing will make claims to which they are neither financially nor morally entitled.I do not know how the Government will get out of this dilemma because I suspect there will be an enormous number of unjustified claims which will be extremely difficult to take on. It is a courageous Government that stands up to people left holding the baby or, in this case, the elderly. Whereas every single penny should be paid out for justifiable claims by people who were treated badly, there is a real danger in separating those from others who feel that this is an opportunity to reclaim funds to which they are not entitled. It is difficult for politicians or governments to fight that type of battle. When individuals with apparent hard-luck stories go to the Supreme Court, there is a media frenzy. Some of the time these are worthy cases, but once in a while they are not. This is a real difficulty for the Government so we must ensure that the compensation pot is not exploited.I wish to say a number of things about the debate that is opening up on the elderly and nursing homes. If we are to be honest about it, the taking of pension books by nursing homes or anyone else was despicable. It is difficult, however, to deal with situations of this kind. It may not be a nice thought but we must recognise that, on the whole, nursing homes are in the business for the money. Private nursing homes are established in order to make money, although some of us may find that difficult to reconcile with the idea that medicine and medical care should be an almost philanthropic duty and something to which we are entitled. Nursing homes can be extremely exploitative, ruthless, inhuman and profit-driven. That notion rests uneasily with the idea that humanity comes first. We need to recognise that problem and tackle it.In the time remaining, I wish to make one point.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power. I will probably be repeating many of the statements already made on this issue. I was a Minister of State at the Department of Health between 1987-89. I did not have responsibility for nursing homes so I am not answerable in that regard.The Government has welcomed the clarity provided by the Supreme Court judgment, notwithstanding the fact that it is causing major difficulties for it. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made the point that at the Council of State meetings, which are held in private, they advised President McAleese to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court. The contentious provision will be constitutional when it is passed by the Houses as part of new legislation.It is an understatement to say that the situation is a mess; it is an unmitigated disaster as far as the Administration is concerned. It is the task of the Government to bring clarity to the matter and to take appropriate action, as is required to ensure the Supreme Court decision is adhered to.Approximately 14 Bills have been referred to the Supreme Court over the years, only two of which have been deemed unconstitutional. It is a major decision for the Supreme Court to make this ruling. Ambiguity and difficulty have surrounded the question of charging for nursing homes for a long time. The same was true of private nursing homes. Where a bed was not available for a person with a medical card in a public nursing home, he or she had no alternative but to seek a bed in a private nursing home. This is where a difficulty will arise in regard to repayments as a result of the Supreme Court decision.The lawyers are already gathering to make claims. A lawyer, Mr. Fox, was on "Today with Pat Kenny" the other day giving advice. He urged people to apply immediately due to the possibility of the Government invoking a statute bar for the seven-year period back to 1998. That is the advice that was given to listeners on that occasion.The Government made a decision last year to give an ex gratia payment of €2,000. The sum of €15.8 million has been repaid to 8,000 nursing home residents. That information appeared in the Irish Independent on 22 February. I assume the information is accurate. Such repayments were quick, effective and efficient.I previously raised the case in the House of a nursing home resident in Roscommon. Deductions were made from his contributory old age pension. However, a British pension coming to the institution was seized without his permission and added to the fund. Many such anomalous situations occurred. This resident is eligible for a refund of his British pension even though it was only taken for a short time. I understand a number of other pensions were secured by administrators on the basis of the considerable cost of nursing home beds. The actual cost of a public nursing home bed could be in the region of €500 per week. The Minister of State will probably have the figures.Public nursing homes are well funded and provide the best service. The Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon is a case in point. It has a full administration, nursing staff and a medical orderly on duty every day. It was brought to my attention over the years that medical cards were taken from people. As a former chairman of the Western Health Board many issues came before me. I was told that when a person was admitted to a public nursing home, he or she was given full care and attention, including all drugs and medical attention. That seemed logical. There was no need for a medical card when a doctor was on call all day every day. Were patients deprived of the services of their own doctor in the nursing home and did they have to rely on the hospital orderly? These issues now arise. Senator Ross made a very good point. He asked how much freedom nursing home residents have.As chairman of the Western Health Board I put forward a proposal that there should be a holiday scheme for nursing home residents. One can make suggestions but get very little reaction to them from the executive. I considered that people who were fit and able should be given two weeks away, be it in another health board institution, private institution or a centre abroad. There is no reason they could not be given a proper break. I respectfully suggest that with money coming into the system people should be encouraged to spend the money they are refunded and enjoy their years ahead. The same applies to the €500 million bonanza that will be paid back to residents. So be it. The money will be recycled in the State. If anybody thinks that long-stay residents of nursing homes will head off or invest in imported products he or she can forget about it, the money will be spent in the State. Good luck to those people; I wish them well. I hope they enjoy their freedom to spend money. Perhaps some of them will decide to leave their institutions and go back home and avail of nursing assistance there.

A redress board would be more effective than the system that is proposed. Some families of deceased nursing home residents might be well advised not to put in a claim because they may be opening a can of worms as far as claims are concerned, as the State will also investigate the circumstances surrounding the issuing of the pension in the first instance.As public representatives we will receive representations from nursing home residents and their families. We should commend the Minister for grasping the nettle and taking action where it was required. I also commend the Opposition for stating its support for the proposed Bill that will impose charges. Opposition Members support the concept of charges being levied on people for nursing home care. I received documentation regarding access to private nursing homes and the rules concerning them. Residents of private nursing homes who have medical cards will also be eligible to claim as they also had to pay for their care.

It is time to pay tribute to the nurses and other staff of nursing homes for their valiant efforts over the years to provide care which goes well beyond monetary value.My party highlighted the issue last year as people were still being charged illegally for nursing home care. The previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was given repeated warnings about the situation. While I welcome the Supreme Court decision, it pointed out that any money accruing to patients or their descendants was not a windfall but rather an entitlement which was wrongly denied by this and other Governments. The court stated that the property rights of the weak and vulnerable particularly merited attention. I do not wish to play a political game but, as politicians, we should stand back and consider that the weak and vulnerable in our society did not receive the response to which they were entitled. I do not believe anyone intended to "do" these people but their rights were overlooked and I hope we never face the same situation.I also hope Senator Leyden's comments do not represent a Government threat to the effect that people who seek to be reimbursed for money taken will be examined to find out where their pensions were obtained in the first place. I wish to clarify if it is Senator Leyden's policy or that of the Government. We should not place any obstacles in the way of people seeking that to which they are entitled.

The meagre offer of a payment of €2,000 to compensate for a gross breach of constitutional rights was wrong. How many medical card holders were forced to go into private nursing homes due to the lack of public nursing beds? Those people could also be eligible for compensation.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	This is the most astonishing piece of bureaucratic bungling by the Department of Health and Children which there is no point discussing. However, these issues seem to recur and I ask the Minister of State to address the issue in his reply. For example, I was amazed to find a Department of Health and Children estimate of 35,000 extra people being in need of medical cards was, in fact, only 50% of the number which eventually applied for them. This sort of occurrence is inexplicable except when one discovers that officials in the Department of Health and Children were given the details of the over-70s free medical card scheme days before it was introduced. Such important schemes should not be pulled like a rabbit out of a hat by the Ministers for Finance or Health and Children; there should be proper planning.Will the Minister of State use this occasion to plan for people in old age who may not want to go into nursing homes? At present, there are people who feel they have been robbed of their pensions by being sent to nursing homes when they might have far preferred to have stayed outside if more facilities had been available.During the debate on child care yesterday, I raised the issue of the scheme in France whereby one can use special social care cheques which can be given to people who work in one's home caring, for example, for children or elderly people. The cheques can be up to a value of approximately €5,000 to €6,000. They can be obtained in banks and the money can be used tax free while the person who receives the cheques can accumulate them up to a taxable income. This means people are not engaged with the black economy. It provides a very good reason for giving those who pay for the care a tax free allowance in this way because the Exchequer will take in more tax. The promotion of day care hospitals and respite care for carers will help the situation so that we do not have to have the number of people in nursing homes who do not want to be there.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The decision of the Supreme Court on 16 February 2005 in the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 has brought clarity to the matter of the provisions of the Bill. The Supreme Court found the retrospective provision of the Bill in making lawful the imposition and payment of such charges in the past unconstitutional in so far as this concerns the property rights of citizens. The Supreme Court did not find the approach to the proposed charges in the Bill to be repugnant to the Constitution so the prospective provisions to allow such charging in the future were not found to be repugnant to the Constitution.The debate in this House has, in general, been constructive and fair, with contributions from Members on all sides. A number of Senators asked why the practice of charging continued for so long. In setting up the Travers inquiry, the Tánaiste has tried to establish the answer to that question. In seeking apologies Senator Burke was jumping the gun in this regard. In fairness, we should await the findings of the report rather than jump to conclusions before it is published. It is due to be published in the near future when we will debate the matter in more detail.The Department of Health and Children is studying the Supreme Court judgment in detail and will take on board all the consequences for policy and law arising from the judgment. It is very important that charges for long-stay care are placed on a sound legal basis, which is what we are endeavouring to do. The decision of the Supreme Court allows for the introduction of a new Bill to provide the legal basis for charges for inpatient services in long-stay institutions. The Government yesterday approved the Bill that provides for the imposition of such charges in respect of all persons irrespective of their eligibility status for health services. The intention is that the Bill will be presented to Dáil Éireann with a view to its passage through the Oireachtas as soon as possible.It is the position currently that charges are not being imposed. Following receipt of further advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Health and Children instructed the health boards to cease imposing any financial charges on fully eligible people in receipt of in-patient services in public long-stay institutions with effect from 9 December 2004. By way of a goodwill gesture the Government agreed to have an ex gratia payment of up to €2,000 made to those with full eligibility who have paid charges and who were alive on 9 December 2004. The Health Service Executive is making the necessary arrangements in regard to this scheme and so far payments in excess of €15.7 million have been made to approximately 8,500 individuals.It is intended to introduce a repayment scheme which will replace the ex gratia schemes. A special Cabinet sub-committee comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General has been established to consider the issue of repayment in light of the judgment. The sub-committee is meeting today to consider all the options for an efficient and effective repayment scheme, including the Statute of Limitations, without the need for litigation. This matter will be considered at full Cabinet again next week. It is estimated that at least €500 million will be repaid. Any payments made under the ex gratia scheme will be taken into account in calculating any further moneys to be repaid.The Government is determined to ensure that the repayment scheme which will be put in place is fair and reasonable to all concerned. The speed of action in setting up the Cabinet sub-committee coupled with the immediate Cabinet follow-through demonstrates the seriousness and concern with which this issue is viewed. It is the Government's intention to devise a scheme which is fair and one which will ensure that the people entitled to a repayment will be paid as quickly as possible. We will put in place a scheme that will ensure that those who are entitled to compensation will not require legal assistance to collect that payment.It is important to note that what is at issue is the legal basis for the imposition of charges for those receiving inpatient services in public, long stay institutions. The principle of imposing charges is not at issue. As has been noted by previous Governments over the past 30 years, it is fair and reasonable that those in receipt of publicly provided residential long-term care should make some payment towards accommodation and daily living costs if they can afford to do so, just as they would if they were living in the community. This principle was most recently underlined in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You. It supports the aim to provide as high quality a service as possible, to make the most equitable use of resources and to help maximise the availability of services.It is recognised that quality care is expensive and that the bulk of the cost of providing a high standard of quality care should be borne by the Exchequer. It is estimated that the charges imposed on those in public nursing homes represents approximately 10% of the overall cost of care. It therefore represents a modest contribution towards the total cost of treatment and maintenance. Having listened to the contributions to this debate, that view appears to be shared by the House.I appreciate this opportunity to speak to Senators on this matter and I thank them for their contributions.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I move:That Seanad Éireann:—welcomes the very positive labour market figures and notes that the level of employment in Ireland is now at a record high level of almost 1.9 million;—notes that Ireland continues to perform exceptionally well in comparison with our European partners with employment and labour force growth being ahead of the EU average by a factor of three or four and with one of the lowest rates of unemployment in the EU and being considerably lower than that in the larger European states;—commends the Government for a continuing strong performance in employment terms with the number of jobs in Ireland growing by more than 1,000 per week;—congratulates the Government on these very positive figures which clearly show that current Government policies are working extremely well and are further vindication of its economic strategy;—maintains that the Government is well on its way to achieving its ambition to effectively eliminate long-term unemployment, which is continuing to fall;—acknowledges the unprecedented commitment shown by the parties in Government since 1997 in tackling unemployment which has resulted in historic in-roads in reducing joblessness, particularly for people who have been without a job for a long time;—urges the Government to continue with the thrust of this successful approach and to continue to bring forward policies specifically targeted at tackling unemployment and providing jobs, while recognising that continuing high priority must be given to those areas which have fallen behind the national employment average; and—welcomes the measures in the most recent budget which will build on the Government's economic and social strategy of focusing on getting people back to work by investing in employment and education.The employment level of 1.9 million is dramatic. It is a level that all parties sought to achieve when in Government but never thought they would achieve it. However, it was achieved in 2003.I was previously a Minister of State at the then Department of Industry and Commerce with responsibility for exports. The major investment made in the 1960s by the then Government of Seán Lemass, which included Donagh O'Malley as Minister for Education, led to the creation of the economy we enjoy today. We have the best educated workforce in the world, produced by the best teachers and the best second and third level education system.Ireland offers investors a stable, profitable English speaking base to service world markets. Over 1,000 overseas companies have made Ireland their location of choice. Ireland has positioned itself as an attractive location for inward investment companies seeking to locate within the European Union. There are many incentives in this regard and they include our corporate tax code, employment law and a strong corporate regulatory regime. Ireland's competitiveness is based not on tax benefits and costs alone, but on knowledge, innovation, flexibility and connectedness in how everything works together. Ireland has demonstrated the ability to adopt, and adapt to, changes in a unique way that connects innovation, knowledge, people and enterprise to meet the fast evolving demands of world markets.Ireland's fostering of highly qualified professionals in technological skills is the key factor in the success with Intel, which is based in Leixlip in the Kildare North constituency where the by-election will be held on 11 March. The company employs 3,800 full-time employees and 1,200 long-term contractors, many of whom have technological qualifications. What a success story for the people of Kildare North as they go to the polls on 11 March to ensure the continuity of a quality Government that supports industry.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Research and development in Ireland is growing at a phenomenal rate, signifying the Government's vision of Ireland becoming a knowledge economy with leadership in the areas of life skills, medical technology, software and information technology. This vision is becoming a reality due to the Government giving high priority to funding research and development. The national development plan commits the Government to expenditure of €2.48 billion on research, technological development and innovation.The Finance Act 2004 provided for a tax credit of 20% in addition to a tax deduction at 10% to 12.5% for research and development expenditure in Ireland. The tax credit is available to Irish tax resident companies engaged in in-house research and development. This gives a potential tax write off for incremental research and development spending of up to 32.5%.Since 1 January 2003, the corporation tax rate on trading income has been 12.5%. This is one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union and one of the lowest onshore rates in the world. A low rate of corporate tax of 10%, known as manufacturing relief, has traditionally applied to deemed manufacturing activities and certain international financial services activities carried out in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, and a broad range of activities carried out in the Shannon Airport zone. Members should note that corporation tax applies to all enterprises, indigenous and foreign owned.On reflection, the Opposition should not move its amendment which states that Seanad Éireann:—notes the low rate of Corporation Tax that led to a huge increase in the number of foreign owned companies and thus employment; and [recognising the contribution of the Government]—calls on the Government to adopt a similar low tax strategy for the indigenous sector" [which it has done].We have complied with the Opposition amendment to this motion. The Opposition should not move the amendment but should agree to the Government motion.I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and compliment him on his excellent work. He has fought the good fight for Ireland, particularly when abroad, where he has assisted the good performance of Enterprise Ireland and the marketing of Irish goods.We have a proud record. Our trade is expanding dramatically and jobs are developing as a result. Ireland is well placed given the expansion of the EU to 25 countries. As the responsibility for passing the Nice referendum was ours, it is a good selling point abroad to the new EU entrants that Ireland was the country which gave the green light for their entry. Our trade has expanded in those countries. Irish enterprise is developing in all the applicant countries and those which have joined. This trade will create jobs at home and abroad and will provide further opportunities for our people to develop abroad.We have a proud record in north County Kildare and County Meath. I am satisfied that as a result of Government policy the results will be very positive on 11 March. I wish our candidates every success. They are standing with great confidence, knowing that the Government introduced the policies we have pursued. It is no accident that 1.9 million people are at work, the highest level of employment ever in the history of the State.My experience abroad as Minister of State with responsibility for trade was that Irish products are well regarded and of a good quality, particularly in the food sector where there is complete traceability. Exports continue to rise. It is important the image of Ireland as a green, wholesome, healthy nation is maintained at all costs. We must ensure that the policy decisions made by Government will enhance this selling point. We are fortunate that Ireland is regarded throughout the world as a country that produces good quality products and, therefore, sales have increased.The Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, continually lead trade missions abroad. I take this opportunity to wish the Minister every success in his difficult portfolio and am glad he has the support of his experienced Minister of State. I congratulate the Tánaiste and former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who was exemplary in her role at that Department from 1997 to 2004, during which time she tackled the high cost of insurance, working with the members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, under the chairmanship of Deputy Cassidy, who worked with the Department-——

Contrary to what Senator Leyden stated, there are a number of issues with which I must take exception.The motion is yet another attempt by Fianna Fáil to claim credit for the Celtic tiger, something it inherited and which was due to the good policy of several previous Governments, most notably the rainbow Government, and was built by the hard work and sacrifice of the people. The Government parties have a brass neck in tabling this motion given that 160,543 people are now on the live register, which represents an increase of almost 2,000 in January of this year. Some 63,000 redundancy notices were issued between May 2002 and the end of September 2004, including 12,719 in metal manufacturing and engineering and almost 8,500 in the banking, finance and insurance sector.The rainbow Government left the incoming Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration with an economy that was creating 1,000 jobs a week, a record it subsequently fumbled and is only now beginning to regain. The rainbow Government was the first Administration to record a current Government surplus since 1972 — a record since lost despite 34 stealth tax rises since the last election. Moreover, the rainbow Government left office with a 1.5% inflation rate whereas we all know the current Government's record on inflation since the 2002 general election.

In addition, the loss of 150 jobs was announced yesterday at Castlemahon Foods, Limerick, with which you will be familiar, a Chathaoirligh. Perhaps Senators on the Government side would care to speak to these 1,300 people about Ireland's exceptional performance, which is referred to in the motion.Despite an increase in export sales of €1 billion among Enterprise Ireland's client firms, there was a net job loss of 1,317 in 2004. While there has clearly been a drop in unemployment since 1997, the Government cannot claim all the credit for this. It was the Fine Gael-led rainbow Government that introduced the low corporation tax rate and increased foreign direct investment, and it was this decision that led to the number of foreign companies rising from around 20,000 Forfás-assisted companies in 1994, to 70,000 today. This represents a 250% increase and is the area where the vast majority of new workers are employed.However, the number of indigenous companies has remained almost static since Fianna Fáil and the PDs came into office in 1997. The Forfás 2003 annual report states:Ireland's economic expansion in 2003 was led by growth in domestic consumption, infrastructure investment and house-building. This meant that the employment growth took place in the public sector, private services and the construction industry, rather than in the more export-oriented industrial sectors supported by the enterprise development agencies. This is reflected in the employment levels in agency-supported companies, which stood at 297,500 in 2003, a decrease of almost 7,500 on 2002. 2003 was the third consecutive year where there has been a net decrease in employment in agency-supported companies. This resulted in 19,000 fewer jobs in manufacturing and internationally traded services compared to the peak of 316,500 in 2000.The same report states:The manufacturing sector accounted for all of the net decrease in agency-supported employment in 2003. Within the internationally traded services sector job gains and losses were in balance with 8,500 of both. In contrast, there were 14,000 jobs created in manufacturing, but these were more than outweighed by losses of 21,500. The computer and electronics sector accounted for almost half of the net decrease. The textile sector and the paper and printing sector also witnessed significant net decreases, with approximately 1,000 jobs lost in each.Perhaps this is explained by Jim Power, the leading economist, who stated that Irish competitiveness has been seriously eroded by a sharp increase in the overall cost base, which will not be reversible. He went on to say that to ensure the future prosperity of the Irish economy it is absolutely essential that investment in education to upskill the workforce and a correction of the very damaging infrastructural deficit are given immediate real priority and not just lip-service.The point here is that the Government has reaped the rewards in the private sector, now mainly foreign-owned and encouraged by low corporation tax while it has completely failed to generate homegrown business by allowing out of control, untargeted spending that ultimately had to be paid back through higher taxes and stealth charges, increasing our cost base significantly.The message, though the Government parties do not wish to hear it, is that they have inherited a foreign jobs boom from their predecessors thanks to a low corporation tax rate. They have completely failed to help the indigenous sector to reach its potential.Senator Leyden referred briefly to the amendment that has been proposed in the name of the Fine Gael Senators. I will explain it briefly. Large-scale multinationals have the ability to absorb the various increases in stealth taxes that have occurred since 2002. Economies of scale alone ensure that such firms are often not seriously hurt by such increases in their cost bases. Indigenous firms, usually of a much smaller scale, have great difficulty in absorbing these costs. In calling for a similar low-tax strategy for the indigenous sector we simply ask for an end to taxation by stealth and a reappraisal of the way small-scale Irish business people are treated. For instance, self-employed people are ineligible for the family income supplement, an issue that has been raised several times.Let us look at the way a total lack of tax strategy has led to stealth tax after stealth tax, disproportionately impacting on indigenous businesses. In 2002, VAT was increased in the budget after the election; motor tax rose by 12%; bank charges and bank card charges by 108%; bin charges by 29%; and ESB charges by 13%. In 2003, development levies were introduced, adding greatly to costs, and motor tax increased by a further 5%. In 2004, there was another 9% increase in ESB charges and in January 2005 another 3.5% ESB price rise was given the green light by Government.In tandem with the low-tax strategy we want a pro-small business banking and insurance agenda. Banks appear to have little interest in attracting small business people at the moment, but put all their energies into attracting large companies. Economic consultants Compecon say the lack of competition in the banking sector is costing small businesses €500 million. We call on the Government to ease the unnecessary burden placed on them by raising the audit level in line with our EU partners to €3 million of turnover, to raise the threshold level at which VAT is collected to €100,000 and to ensure the reduction in charges by profitable, monopolistic State utilities so that the Government can play a practical role in reducing inflation instead of being a part of the problem.

The boom, however, is creating certain difficulties as there are people from new EU member states such as Poland who are not being paid at proper rates. When contractors for these countries quote for contracts in Ireland, as they are perfectly entitled to do, is it pointed out to them in their cost estimates what type of labour rates prevail in this country in construction? It is important for them to know this before they enter the State and not to repeat the situation experienced by Polish subcontracting workers or Turkish road workers outside Ennis, although I do not know if the latter case has been proven. It has become a feature of working in this country that joint ventures and subcontractors from abroad must fuel their activities in the construction boom in this way.My concern surrounds indigenous industry. This motion is personally timely because, for a long time, I have felt that west Limerick has done well on an economic level in terms of the degree of activity it has experienced. However, four industries have been lost within a radius of five miles in a rural location over a period of three weeks. One such industry was the Kerry Group plant in Kantoher, which operated as Kantoher Products for over 100 years before Kerry Group took over in the early 1990s and sustained the production of chickens. One would have anticipated that, under the Kerry Group banner, it would have been extremely successful, but the group said that the plant was not competitive. At the same time that it announced the closure in Kantoher, Kerry Group announced a €20 million investment in south-east Asia. I was saddened to read of this occurring in my area.Drum Engineering in Drumcollogher closed with very little fanfare or publicity, amounting to a loss of 30 jobs. A very successful entrepreneur, Mr. John O'Reilly, closed his vegetable business with a loss of another 30 jobs. O'Kanes has reduced its workforce in Castlemahon Foods by 150. I equate this loss of 350 jobs overall within such a small rural area as a devastating loss on a par with 1,000 or 1,500 job losses in Dublin businesses such as Packard Bell. Whenever an industry closes, there is an immediate call to form a task force. If a question were asked in the other House on how many task forces there are around the country, one would be staggered by the answer.I remember that Giro was the last overseas company attracted to west Limerick. That was in 1991. It vested itself of the assembly unit and currently has a marketing unit calling itself Bell Sports. There were advance factories and economic buoyancy in the area, but then the factories began to close. One does not ordain the headlines in newspapers such as in the Irish Examiner of 22 February 2005 which stated “Finucane attacks Shannon Development”. I was critical of the organisation. If one decides to develop an industrial unit into a series of retail units, and one later decides to allow another unit offering repair and maintenance to the county council, in the case of Newcastle West, to move from one location to another, by definition one is saying that industry cannot be attracted into these areas. A factory that lies idle does not provide Shannon Development with a revenue base, while renting out development and retail units does so. With regard to the sort of gloom that exists in our area, what signal is being given regarding the possibility of attracting alternative industry? I would like to see the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, visit the area and say that an effort will be made to find alternative industries. We may be buoyant regarding developments in the chemical, pharmaceutical and health care sectors, but we are losing out on the indigenous side.I know that global forces currently predominate and that with regard to chicken processing we have imports from France, Holland, Denmark, Brazil, Thailand and many other countries. I noticed recently that if one bought an Irish chicken the producer's name and address were on the front of the packaging. Some of the chickens coming into this country are being packaged here but originate from outside the EU and are being passed off as Irish produce. It all comes down to traceability. The sooner that is introduced the better, so the consumer knows if the product is Irish or not.Regarding the Industrial Development Authority, I wonder if its vision is confined to the main urban areas. There was a commitment given in Government policy that it would try to move outside the greater Dublin area. I would like to see part of that office dispersed in the mid-west region. The IDA has an opportunity to at least make a statement. It regularly made statements in the past to the effect that it was committed to seeking alternative industries for areas. I no longer see such statements coming from State agencies because in many cases they themselves become part of the task force. I would like to see a more positive drive towards establishing industries, which is why the issue before us is timely.In recent times we have had changes in the status of Shannon Airport, a pivotal tourism area which is also important in terms of the employment it creates around it. If one wants to attract more people to that airport, the major problem is a deplorable road from Ennis to Galway. Infrastructure must be there in order to open up the west. There is a very good road from Limerick to Shannon and a reasonably good one to Ennis. The Ennis bypass will be built but currently one has to continue on that road. I hope the bypass will be a priority over the next few years. It is fine for Ryanair and other airlines to go into Shannon and create the buoyancy required there but one needs the infrastructure in order to attract people to that area.I make the following point constructively. If one were considering a business, would one know to go to local Leader groups or to the county enterprise board? When would one go to Shannon Development? Would one approach the IDA? Where does one go in this regard? It struck me a long time ago that a one-stop-shop is needed because so many bodies are involved, though as a member of the county enterprise board for many years, I have seen a lot of good work done by it with regard to small industry.I extend an open invitation to the Minister, Deputy Martin, even in the context of this laudable motion, to visit my area and see what is happening on the ground. He might then realise that the Celtic tiger is beginning to pass some of us by.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The past is another place, and when we talk of the economy in Ireland we are certainly talking of a different place. The Buchanan report of the 1960s, which dealt with the economy, the demographics and the trends, showed an economy largely dependent on agriculture. It showed demographics out of synch with the rest of Europe. Many children were being born yet the number of people who remained in the country after the age of 21 was very low. Many females were unmarried. There were many older people. Our demographics were skewed and our economy was mired by the fact that we had not developed. We had not developed economically at that stage but we set about it then and we have made a very good job of it. Indeed we have become an example for parts of the rest of Europe and our European colleagues now come to us to ask how we succeeded. The success story probably stems from the 1980s and great credit is due to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for their work in this area.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and compliment him on the work he is doing to ensure growth and to make us a shining light in Europe. One can only be described as such when compared to the people about one. The nations around us are not growing at the rate at which we are growing. They do not have the net inward migration we have. They have not got our growth rates. We are dealing with the difficulties of growing an economy with regard to people's lifestyles, trying to get everything right, improving our infrastructure and the way in which people can do their work in order to advance as an economy and as a people. A nation is much more than an economy.Unfortunately the Opposition tends to give the impression that we are not doing as well as we are. One can of course point to areas which have, perhaps, suffered in recent times but our policy is for regional growth. That is well stated and clearly followed through. We have spatial policies to prove this approach. We have gateways and hubs, and decentralisation. They are all geared towards ensuring that every area of the country moves forward.The strength of our economy is our effort to ensure that everyone who wishes to be involved gets involved. Our next challenge will probably be in the child care area because in many homes, both parents are now working. That challenge will also be met by the Government.In economic terms, 2005 has begun on a very upbeat note. The December budget was exactly what we needed in order to keep moving forward. The economy is growing at a steady and sustainable rate. Our rates of growth are the envy of our European partners, many of whose economies are effectively stagnant. In a report published just before Christmas, Standard and Poor's, the world's foremost provider of independent credit ratings, affirmed Ireland's top triple A long-term and A1-plus short-term credit rating. Standard and Poor's states that the ratings, the highest achievable, are supported by the diversified and flexible nature of the economy, strong general Government finances, favourable demographic structures and future pension liabilities. In other words, we are getting it all right.Standard and Poor's emphasises Ireland's strong economic growth and sizeable foreign direct investment inflows which are still continuing. That is a clear indicator of how people see us from the outside. An article on Ireland in The Economist covered a wide range of issues, including our economy, and stated that Ireland was the best place in the world in which to live. It came first out of 130 countries and as I said in this House before, The Economist is no mean production.Standard and Poor's highlights the fact that the general Government balance has been in surplus for four of the past five years and that Ireland has reduced its debt burden from approximately 90% of GDP a decade ago to approximately 30% of GDP at the end of 2004, giving it the secondlowest debt burden in the euro area.One would need to have lived through the 1980s, a time when interest rates were at 22% and when one held on for dear life, until one's knuckles were white, to any job that one got. Having lived through that, one would realise how well off we are now and how good we have it. One would want to remember the time when Structural Funds could not be drawn down from Europe. One got 90% of a Structural Funds grant but had to come up with 10% and Ireland could not come up with that 10%.It often seems to me that many people cannot quite believe that we have done so well. Perhaps the economic failures of the 1970s and 1980s have left many of us feeling that our success is more a result of good luck than hard work. Strange as it may seem today, just 18 months ago the prophets of doom returned. In the middle of 2003 we were two years into an international downturn. Given that we have one of the most open economies in the world we were always likely to be dragged back by the global slowdown. In the summer of 2003 we experienced a couple of bad months with the live register. The poor figures were exacerbated by the normal seasonal adjustments yet notwithstanding warnings that we should not talk ourselves into recession, many people went ahead and tried to do just that. Opposition politicians were especially culpable in this regard. They ignored the evidence that growth was still well above that of our European peers with every chance of a marked acceleration in 2004. They also chose to ignore that the level of notified redundancies in the first six months of 2003 was 8% down on that which applied in 2002. Instead, we were treated to hysterical claims of doom and gloom. Fine Gael stated that there would be 200,000 on the live register by the end of the year and that the economy would be in recession. With obvious relish and glee, the leader of the Labour Party spoke about a job being lost every 15 minutes. This was when the economy was on the upturn. The Government stuck to its steady course and maintained control.A notable exception to the prophets of doom was Bank of Ireland economist, Dan McLoughlin, to whom we should pay tribute for getting it exactly right. Dr. McLoughlin spoke at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in Sligo and indicated that the prospects for 2004 would be good. He was correct and results have completely vindicated him.The Central Statistics Office's most recent employment figures estimate that the workforce increased by 57,000 in 2004. For the benefit of those who like statistics, this translates into a job being created every ten minutes.We have many people to thank for our success. We should thank the people in the 1960s who had the vision to realise that spending on education would benefit the economy. Such spending on education was a good thing in itself but it also helped encourage growth and job creation. We have got a great many things right such as our policies on taxation and inclusion. We have ensured that everyone in the economy, including the disabled and those who do not hold the same views as us on particular issues, are not discriminated against. Everybody is included and that is a tribute to the success of the Government.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	291	This is one of those motions which, on one level, one finds it difficult to argue against because included in it is a litany of what essentially are facts. It is the tone more than anything else to which one must object.It would be churlish and foolish to say that there have not been improvements in the labour market and in the position as regards employment during the past ten to 15 years. Senator Hanafin is correct to state that there have been enormous improvements. There is no comparison between the position in 2005 to that which obtained when I graduated in the early 1980s and when a significant number of the people with whom I attended college left the country. Many of these individuals returned in the 1990s and have had children, settled down and are doing very well. There is no question that there have been major improvements.I must again — I become blue in the face from doing so — puncture the notion that comes across in all motions of this nature, namely, that the economic boom started in 1997 and that all good derives from then and the election of the current Government at that time. As regards statistics, if one considers the labour market, it is correct to state that the numbers in employment increased by 57,000 last year. This followed on from an increase of 46,000 in 2003 and just 20,000 in 2002. However, this employment growth started in 1994. Without becoming too bogged down in statistics, the numbers for that year were 38,000 and they were 61,000, 47,000 and 51,000, respectively, for the subsequent three years. During the period in question, either Fianna Fáil was in Government with the Labour Party or the rainbow coalition was in power. All parties are entitled to take a share of the credit as a result. We do the argument no service by suggesting that this is an entirely party political achievement. Far from it. It is an achievement of the Irish people over 15 years and has manifested itself in much improved employment numbers during the past ten years.Senator Finucane made an interesting and important contribution and pointed out a major weakness in the overall picture. It is true that employment numbers have increased dramatically but we have developed a reliance on certain sectors which is worrying and which may be temporary. The most recent Central Bank report highlights the fact that some 220,000 people are employed in the construction sector. This represents 12% or one in eight of the total number of people employed in our economy. That, in a sense, is a measure of success because the construction industry is in some ways a weather vane for the economy. If the economy is doing well, construction will typically do well and that is good. However, it can also be temporary and is certainly not the basis on which economic growth into the future should be built. A total of 80,000 units of housing will be constructed this year but that compares to only 40,000 two years ago. No one knows what will be the figure two years from now. The point is that while we are employing 220,000 people now, we were employing much fewer than that two years ago and we could well be doing so again two years from now.There is also major reliance on the multinational sector in areas such as ICT, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc, which is a matter of concern. Without wishing to overstate the case, this amounts to something similar to a significant failure on behalf of Irish capitalism. We have completely failed to develop a scale of indigenous industry which is comparable to the rest of Europe. The number of Irish firms employing 100 people or more has remained virtually constant for the past ten or 20 years. As Senator Finucane pointed out, many of these firms are running into difficulties or are deciding to locate elsewhere. We have not managed to develop our indigenously owned SME sector to such a degree that it is sustainable or that it is contributing, to a greater extent than previously, to the economy.Senator Hanafin and others have stated that Government policy has produced a hugely increased level of employment. That is correct but it is largely confined to the construction sector or the foreign owned sector. That is not necessarily a bad thing. We have been successful in inducing foreign industry to locate here, largely as a base for the European market. The difficulty, however, lies in keeping such industry here. In that context, we must consider carefully the factors which drew it here in the first instance.I agree with most of what has been said about the necessity of having a well educated, English speaking workforce. That is important and it is hoped that these advantages will remain with us into the future. I also agree that the low rate of corporation tax has played an important part. When I was a Member of the Lower House, I was one of those who argued that we could easily sustain a higher rate — 15% or 17% — of corporation tax. I and my party have always acknowledged that a relatively low rate of corporation tax is important. Low rates of corporation tax have been historically important in terms of attracting foreign owned industry into this country. What is important is maintaining that relative advantage, or at least an advantage, into the future.We are failing to recognise the importance of the signals we are receiving from the new accession states, many of which have rates of corporation tax which are lower than that in Ireland. In one or two cases, these countries have no corporation tax at all. This is clearly a trend that is likely to continue in most, if not all, of the countries which recently acceded to membership of the European Union. The lesson which must be drawn from this is that it is in Ireland's interests to move towards a measure of harmonisation and that we should agree with our European Union counterparts — we should withdraw our veto in this regard — a minimum level of corporation tax. I am not referring to the historically high rates of corporation tax — 35% or 40% — which applied in Ireland and other countries. Such rates would be impractical, unreasonable and downright dangerous. However, we should push for a harmonised rate of 10% or 12% or perhaps slightly higher throughout the European Union. This would be very much in Ireland's interests because if such a rate is not adopted, we will continue to be undercut by countries which, as time passes, will also be able to compete with us in terms of the educated workforces they will be able to provide.I am a member of the board of the Northside Partnership which is based in Coolock and which, it is fair to say, is one of the more successful of the partnership companies. Senator White's distinguished husband is chairperson of the board. I have been a member of the board for three or four years and I have watched with interest the unemployment numbers for the area. The live register numbers with which we are presented at each board meeting make for fascinating reading and present a clear picture. They indicate that the number of those who are either long-term or short-term unemployed is largely confined to relatively defined groups of people. For example, significant numbers of them are lone parents or are disabled, on invalidity pension or otherwise unable to work, either full-time or part-time. In addition, a significant number in that part of the city are former drug abusers, drug abusers or ex-offenders. These are people who are largely disconnected or only loosely connected to the labour market and they are not competing for jobs on a daily basis. In some cases — I refer here to disabled people — they are not in a position to work full-time.These categories of people require targeted interventions. We have been slow in providing this, traditionally relying on measures such as community employment schemes which do not do the business any more. Such schemes are useful for getting certain work done in the community which otherwise would not be done. They are also useful for loan parents who want to work only part time, or for short periods of the week. Community employment has not been effective in recent years, however, as a means of getting people into full-time employment and we have relied on it too much. I am not arguing that we should cut the numbers, lest what I am saying is distorted or I am misunderstood. It performs a function, but not the primary one for which it was intended, namely, to get people into full-time employment.We need to focus far more on the more difficult areas of training and education. The experience since the introduction in 1998 of the national employment action plan, NEAP, has been interesting and instructive in that about 50% of the people interviewed went into employment. It is probably fair to assume that a number were already in employment, and this only came to light when they were called for interview. However, about 50% went into employment, about 25% went into training and the remainder are still unemployed. We must increase the numbers of people going into training and further education because the experience since we started looking carefully at those numbers is clear-cut. When long-term unemployment numbers started to come down, the first people to get jobs were the young. Then there were people with some educational qualifications, training or apprenticeships. Next were those with some previous work experience. The people left were those without qualifications or work experience of any kind. Frequently, they included people with secondary difficulties, whether of a physical nature or otherwise.I was sceptical about the NEAP when it was introduced, but there is no gainsaying that it has been quite successful in identifying the nature of the problem and, to some extent, dealing with it. It has been more successful in identifying the nature of the problem than dealing with it and we need to sharpen the focus, particularly in terms of getting people into training and following them through the process of re-education back into the workforce.I want to say a few words about female participation in the workforce. The numbers increased dramatically in the early to mid-1990s, but they appear to have stagnated in recent years at around the 47% of 48% mark. The reasons are pretty clear. The participation rates for single or newly-married women are about the European average. Participation rates for mothers, however, are a good deal lower than the European average. The glaring reason for this is child care. This has been identified as far back as 1997 or 1998, so it is no news to anybody. However, we have singularly failed to produce the type of provision that makes work a viable option for women with children, whether lone parents or married.I strongly believe there is no substitute for direct provision by the State. We have relied too much on supporting the community and voluntary sectors. This is fine where the community and voluntary sectors are doing the business. Let us by all means subsidise them if their work may not be done without subsidy. However, this is not sufficient and it leaves enormous gaps, particularly in areas of disadvantage. Rather than the State coming in to fill such gaps, it is its primary duty to provide the basic infrastructure in the first instance so we need to extend school backwards. If we can provide primary schooling as a matter of constitutional right for all children to the age of 14 or 15, we should start that a year earlier. Whether it is school, community or crèche-based is not really a matter of concern. Ideally, people should have as much choice as possible. However, it is primarily the responsibility of the State to do it by way of direct provision. Let us, by all means, provide additional assistance and subsidies to the community and voluntary sectors on top of that, but we must accept our responsibilities in the first instance.I will leave it at that. My message is simply that the numbers are good, but they hide an over-reliance on certain sectors that are not Irish-owned, or where the jobs are not permanent or in the traded sector, which underpins economic growth. In addition, certain categories of easily defined people are not associated or connected with the labour market and they are getting left behind by current policies which need to be more direct and interventionist.

I want to address the challenges facing indigenous Irish firms. My colleagues have spoken about the great success of the economy. However, since Senators Cummins and Phelan both raised the issue of closures, I want to make a few key points.Indigenous companies in Ireland, particularly those in the manufacturing and internationally traded sectors, now face challenges which are different from anything they have experienced in the past. The combination of continuing cost increases and the ever-increasing attraction of lower-cost locations such as central and eastern Europe, China and India means that Ireland may not continue to sustain the types of businesses that were possible in the 1990s. The low-cost model is no longer an option for Ireland, but the Minister will recall Mr. Jim Power saying at the DHL awards last week that there was nothing essentially wrong with this and that it was better that wages were increasing, since we want to upscale the economy. It would be worrying if the wages had not gone up or if they were going down. It is important for Senator Phelan to get a lesson in economics and to learn why indigenous companies are in trouble. I have not heard any sound reason from the Senator or his colleague to explain why the businesses mentioned have not survived.

The companies that provide such jobs are intensely market-focused and innovative, providing new and proprietary products and services at premium rates. The challenge for indigenous companies, both established and emerging, is to transform themselves sufficiently quickly into innovative and productive enterprises. I can speak from my own experience, having started in Connie Doody's kitchen with our Lir chocolates brand. We employ 90 people from Christmas to Easter. Indigenous companies will not survive unless they innovate. As Mr. Jim Power said, they have to be competitive in the face of rising costs while trying to improve their margins at the same time, without putting up prices. That is a serious challenge and I would like the Minister to reflect on it in his enterprise portfolio.The Government's role is to provide the proper infrastructure in which to do business. A proper immigration policy is necessary and this is a very serious issue. Jim Power also said that foreign direct investment will be much more difficult to get. However, I believe it is critical, as Senator McDowell has said, to develop indigenous industry. The objective should be to get it to be the cornerstone in areas that have not been touched by foreign investment, around the Wexford and Waterford regions, for example. Jim Power also suggested this approach. I suggest to Senators Phelan and Cummins that if one is taking this motion seriously, one should look at how one can develop one's own area.

Companies must make the strategic decisions to engage in marketing and research and development in order to survive. We will require high-skilled immigrants, probably with PhDs. International investors are no longer looking at whether we have the infrastructure in place. When the IDA was meeting prospective customers 20 years ago, such customers wanted to see that there was a good infrastructure. They now want to know how many PhD graduates are in a particular area and the subjects in which they completed their doctorates. That is the way industry has gone.From my own experience in business, the bottom line is that one has to be agile and be able to react swiftly. There is no hanging around — it is not like in politics where there is no rush on some issues. I learned that lesson. To survive in business, one has to be quick footed and alert.

The motion has been tabled because a number of indigenous industries have not survived. They have not been able to switch markets, their products have gone out of date and they will have to develop new products. The State agencies for which the Minister is now responsible are sincerely focused on indigenous industry. It is much more difficult to develop indigenous industry than it is to bring in multinational companies.The Government has the responsibility to implement a proper immigration policy and should not be afraid to bring in highly-skilled people. I did not agree with Jim Power's view on benchmarking. Benchmarking has prevented public sector strikes. We have had very smooth industrial relations since we brought it in. Even though it is a problem for companies and it puts more pressure on the competitiveness of business, I believe it has been a positive decision.Starting up a business and surviving is a very difficult task. I often think that the only people who understood how hard it was for us were the buyers from Quinnsworth and Superquinn. They saw so many businesses which did not succeed. As Senator McDowell said, the development of indigenous industry has to be the challenge for the State agencies in the future. From the Minister's speech last week, I believe that is his goal.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	314	No one can dispute the fact that we have the lowest unemployment rate for many years. We accept that fact. However, there are pockets that have been identified as unemployment blackspots. For the first time in ten years, County Galway experienced a substantial rise in unemployment last month. That is regrettable, because areas in Galway were identified for development in the past ten years. The Minister visited Ballinasloe last month. Over the past seven years, 1,300 jobs were lost in that area. AT Cross was the first to go and it was the flagship of industry in County Galway. The engineering company Square D followed two years later. Now the Dubarry shoe company has closed. These three major employers in Ballinasloe went one after the other. That occurred in addition to the fact that we had lost jobs in other areas of the town. St. Bridget's Hospital lost a further 700 jobs which were displaced from Ballinasloe and scattered throughout the county.As far back as seven years ago, a task force was formed under the Minister's predecessor and all the agencies were called in to encourage industries to come to Ballinasloe. While they have not failed completely, were it not for the fact that the county enterprise board stepped in under the leadership of its CEO, Mr. Charles Lynch, we would not have had any input in the area of job creation. That is unfortunate.Enterprise Ireland has invested in the area as a result of the foresight and hard work of the local enterprise group, which the Minister met on his visit to Ballinasloe. An industrial park is now to be developed. The fact is that 12 people visited Ballinasloe as an area that was suitable for development, where the facilities were readily available and where the infrastructure was ideal. It is a sad situation when the IDA cannot convince those people that Ballinasloe is an ideal place for investment. There was very little industrial difficulty there over the years. There are good facilities, including schools, a hospital and a connection to the road and rail networks. However, we still cannot attract investment.I am convinced that the only way that confidence will be restored to Ballinasloe is if the Government takes the lead by way of investment or incentives. I ask that the town of Ballinasloe and the middle Shannon area are designated for tax incentives. I know the Minister will claim that we cannot give tax incentives to certain areas as Europe will stop us. The important thing is that we are talking about a catchment area of 6,000 people who always depended on Ballinasloe as the focal point. It is probably the only town in the west of Ireland in which there is a declining population. The numbers on the register of voters declined between 2002 and the last local elections not because people were not included but because fewer of them live in Galway East. I call on the Minister to acknowledge that unless the Government leads by creating an incentive to restore confidence, those who currently live in the constituency will also leave. It is important to provide leadership.We hear regularly about the various factors which lead to job losses, but there is no doubt that the west of Ireland is disadvantaged in many ways. Transport costs to move goods between Ballinasloe and Dublin Port, whether importing raw material or exporting goods, are high. We are at a disadvantage because of our location. While the IDA has done tremendous work in certain areas, a 1996 ministerial directive aimed to ensure the authority delivered an even distribution of industry through the regions has not been implemented. There has been a mindset within the IDA over the last number of years which leads it to consider Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Athlone while Ballinasloe has been left isolated between the last two centres. It is a difficult scenario.The proposal to decentralise represented an ideal opportunity to demonstrate confidence in the town and we should have indicated that a worthwhile Department would be moved there. The uptake for the proposed decentralised NRA office in Ballinasloe was poor. If a serious effort were made to decentralise a reasonably significant body, it would demonstrate the confidence of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the area. I acknowledge that the Minister is not responsible for decentralisation and has enough blame on his plate without being blamed for the many failures within that process.It is not too late to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the identification of a development triangle among Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore. I ask the Minister to consider this. Ballinasloe is only 14 miles west of Athlone and could easily be incorporated into the development area to bring it to the attention of the IDA. Despite protestations to the contrary, the IDA has failed miserably to support Ballinasloe as evidenced by its failure to convince 12 potential inward investors who presented with proposals for the area. What is wrong? The infrastructure in Ballinasloe is sufficient as is its tradition of industrial employment. A Minister of State from the area has served for seven years in various Departments, especially the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but he has failed to deliver for Ballinasloe. The Government has reneged on its commitment to the town.We must bin the global figures for the country as a whole as they ignore the black spots which exist. I urge the Minister to recognise the need for the Government to take action to restore confidence to people in areas like Ballinasloe.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I welcome the opportunity presented by the motion to discuss the overall performance of Ireland in recent years in the areas of employment generation, economic success and the objective of maintaining our success going forward. I am also pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the key issues we must address to maintain our competitiveness and the premier status we enjoy among our European neighbours in terms of economic performance.The extent of international media interest and the number of inquiries from countries across the globe in the Irish story are difficult to comprehend at times. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I meet on a weekly basis at home and abroad with people from different sectors internationally who want to find out about the Irish experience and the methods we have used to create so much additional employment. We should acknowledge the tremendous success Ireland has enjoyed over the past ten years but that is not to say we do not continue to face challenges or that there are not difficulties in certain areas. The bottom line is that we have transformed the country in terms of economic and employment growth and are the envy of Europe.People talk about the role of Government, which Senator Ulick Burke attacked regarding Ballinasloe. Interestingly, a key reason cited for the success of Ireland in attracting inward investment is the agility and responsiveness of Government to the needs of multinational companies. Only last week, the directors of Yahoo, which is to set up its European headquarters here, said they felt there was a pro-enterprise approach in Ireland and that we could knock heads together among various interests including the trade union movement, local authorities and Government. We can remove barriers and obstacles and people feel the timeframe they are given within which they can successfully establish an operation in Ireland is reliable. Intel and Dell say they could never have established as rapidly elsewhere in Europe the operations they created here.Our economic growth has been significantly stronger since 1997 than that of our EU partners. The outlook for the future is benign and we expect growth to continue. It is forecast that the economy will grow by 4.7% of GNP in 2005, which is twice the average rate across the 25 member states of the EU. This positive scenario has been recognised by the Commission which acknowledged in its commentary on Ireland's Stability and Growth Pact 2005-07 our strong growth and sound public finances. Strong economic growth has led to significant job increases. Since 1997, the numbers in employment have grown by almost 450,000. According to the unemployment register and notwithstanding blows to the local economy through the closure of traditional industries, Ballinasloe, which I visited recently, has 1,000 more people in employment than a number of years ago.The nature and profile of employment has changed. While we are under pressure in low-cost manufacturing in certain sectors, the services sector has experienced significant growth. Announcements are no longer made about the creation of ten jobs here or five jobs there. We must analyse events. While we acknowledge regional development issues, the additional 450,000 jobs created since 1997 must exist somewhere. They are not all in Cork, Galway and Dublin, the last of which I should have mentioned first.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	318	Senator Ryan is keeping an eye on me. The number of unemployed people has fallen by almost 80,000 from 10.4% to 4.4% in 1997, which is half the average rate among the 25 member states. The number of long-term unemployed persons has dropped by nearly 60,000 from 5.5% to 1.4%, which is approximately 33.3% of the EU average.While unemployment has remained consistently low, it remains necessary to provide for those who are unemployed and find it difficult to secure positions. Following my recent review of FÁS employment schemes, the Government has decided it will continue to operate and provide 25,000 places annually. Senator McDowell commented on the social economy programme and the jobs initiative. We have given certain opinions on the matter and we are in discussions with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to see how we can transfer social economy into a proper community context in order to give a satisfactory underpinning and guarantee, particularly in areas which have experienced difficulties.I recently visited Northside Partnership as part of the Tesco and FÁS initiative which provides retail skills for people who have left education and the workforce. I presented awards to the young women and men involved, which was an uplifting experience. Tribute is particularly due to Northside Partnership and to Senator White's husband, Padraig White, who, together with Senator McDowell and others, provides a first class model of social partnership, making a difference in an area with high unemployment and low skills, etc. The social economy figures were quite high and it made no sense to me to pull them out if we are to be focused and consistent in terms of our employment policy and trying to make a difference in areas which experience difficulties.The emphasis in these schemes will be on developing the quality of intervention by introducing a greater training element with a view to ensuring greater progression to mainstream employment. Our end goal is to assist all those who are unemployed, as best suits their needs, so that they can move into employment.The latest figures for last year show that there were 1,893,600 people in employment, which represents an increase of 57,200 or 3.1% on the previous year. Full-time employment accounted for the majority of the increase. The current employment rate of 67% compares very favourably to the EU 25 rate of 63%. This means a higher proportion of our people are actively involved in the workforce and we are steadily approaching the EU employment rate target of 70%.The outlook is for a considerable expansion of employment and thus the demand for labour. This will mean both increasing the skill levels of our labour force as well as the numbers in it. Given the falling number of young people coming into the labour market, there will be a need to mobilise labour supply from other sources which will mean encouraging more Irish-based people into the labour market. Reference was made to child care initiatives which are an important factor in that regard. It will also mean the adjustment of economic migration policy in Ireland to address identified labour shortages and skills needs. In recent years, the work permit system has been mainly vacancy driven, reflecting demand from employers.With the enlargement of the European Union, it is expected that employers in Ireland will be able to fill the majority of their labour needs from the European Economic Area. Consequently, work permits are now only being granted for non-EEA nationals, by and large, in respect of highly skilled and higher paid positions where no suitable personnel can be sourced within the EEA.Legislation is currently in the final stages of drafting to put the existing employment permit schemes on a sound legislative footing. The proposed Employment Permits Bill 2005 will also include provision for a more managed economic migration policy, including a formal and continual assessment of skills and labour needs. Research carried out by FÁS and the expert group on future needs and skills will continue to inform Government policy in this area.This legislation will also give stronger statutory protection to employees. It will empower those who come into the country, especially those who are highly skilled and needed in specific areas, such as research and development. Science Foundation Ireland places a considerably increased emphasis on attracting world-class researchers into the country. There are other sectors of the economy where, from time to time, we will need high skills, such as information and communication technologies. The legislation will enable the Minister of the day to be flexible and adaptable to emerging skills and respond quickly to those needs as they arise.In addition to increasing the numbers at work, increasing the skills level of the workforce will also be crucial if the economy is to continue to grow. The pressure of globalisation means that Ireland must move up the value chain to become a knowledge-based, innovation driven economy. The emphasis in the past has been on those outside the workforce in terms of skilling and training. However, there is a clear need for a rebalancing of our efforts towards those at work. The report of the enterprise strategy group emphasised the importance of this, particularly for the low skilled.The past 20 years have seen a dramatic acceleration in the growth in educational achievement in Ireland. There is a €27 million increase in this year's budget in company training in order to concentrate on those at work, especially in low skilled employment. There is a significant challenge ahead for business, Government and FÁS in terms of how this will be done. We must incentivise low skill employees to take up programmes of training and courses because they are vulnerable in terms of change. We must also encourage companies to buy into the upskilling of their own employees, which can be difficult because they might fear mobility of employees after the upskilling. However, it is essential for future economic performance and competitiveness.In terms of educational achievements, the completion rate at second level has increased dramatically in the past 20 years, from approximately 60% to more than 80%. The national qualifications framework is important to facilitate the increase in completion and achieve a broader definition of completion. It is not just about getting one's leaving certificate, but about the completion of certified programmes in areas which enable people to take up employment in key sectors.Third level participation has dramatically increased in the past decade. We ramped up the numbers quite considerably in the late 1990s, particularly in software engineering and technician training, etc, to meet the needs of industry and the economy. This is all necessary in terms of increasing the employability of Irish people and attracting investment into the country. On the other hand, the task force on lifelong learning reported that there were still approximately half a million people who had not reached leaving certificate level. This needs to be addressed in the context of in-company training to which I referred earlier.People will need to upskill and re-skill throughout their working lives. Some 80% of people currently working will still be working in ten years' time. They cannot stand still and must therefore participate in the skills programme. We provided €27 million in the last budget, specifically for this area, which was additional funding from the national training fund. Particular emphasis will be placed on delivering a framework for the training of the employed and FÁS will be the main driver in that respect. We will work with companies to help them participate effectively in the programme.Our overall economic development strategy is now aimed at developing a more dynamic, enterprising and innovation-based economy which can sustain higher living standards for all. This involves maintaining an attractive taxation regime and prioritising policies in the fields of research and innovation promotion, entrepreneurship, enhanced competition and consumer policies.Regarding corporation tax, it is important to note the error in terms of the reference to low corporation tax.

It is crucial to the success story of foreign direct investment. I am only at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment since December, but as Minister for Education and Science and also as Minister for Health and Children I dealt with multinational companies. From my experience, the message is clear — without the corporation tax rate we would not make a shortlist of three. Skills, infrastructure and a range of other issues must be satisfactory. Countries outside the European Union are offering zero tax rates. To my knowledge, no country inside the EU offers this rate. Romania's rate is approximately 16%.

However, we are speaking of countries such as Switzerland, Puerto Rico and Singapore as the real competitors in terms of attracting foreign direct investment. Many companies will go to eastern Europe for a range of strategic reasons anyway, but we should not get too paranoid or upset about that fact. There are opportunities for Irish companies to go to eastern Europe as suppliers. Irish companies, now skilled in servicing multinationals, should welcome investment in eastern Europe, get over there and play a role in terms of servicing companies across the board. It is acknowledged that we have built up a lot of expertise in that area.I still have some reservations about harmonisation. I am not too sure if all of Europe, and particularly central Europe, acknowledges the importance of a low corporate tax regime. In the context of the Lisbon Agenda, Europe needs to reflect continually on global competition. Europe does not have a pre-ordained destiny that means it will always be prosperous and wealthy. It will have to compete. Sometimes I feel that Europe is too inward looking and needs to look outside its borders at the emerging competitive forces.Having said that, however, without the EU we would not have transformed our economy, including access to new markets and a significant reduction in our dependency on the UK market.

That remains our agenda going forward.We have a recognised international reputation as regards our capacity to attract foreign direct investment, as evidenced in recent decisions by Yahoo, Bell Labs, Wyeth and CenterCorps.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Approximately 129,000 people are employed by 1,050 companies, half of which are from the United States, so the American dimension is very important. These US companies are responsible for nearly 70% of the value of investments here. US investment is crucial to Ireland's economic success story — it is the largest source of inward investment and accounts for the biggest exporting sector in the country. Nearly one third of all manufacturing inward investment in Ireland comes from the US, as does nearly half of all software investment. Ireland continues to be the leading location in Europe for electronics and is the world's largest exporter of software. As Senators are aware, Ireland is also one of the key locations for pharmaceutical and medical device companies.I do not accept Senator Ulick Burke's comments on the IDA. It is harsh to say the IDA failed to bring some company to a particular town. The IDA organised the 12 itineraries for Ballinasloe. If the IDA was genuinely not interested it would not have done so.

The bottom line is that we must win against stiff competition. We then try to regionalise and the IDA has a regional mandate. The IDA is busily developing infrastructure in Ballinasloe with Enterprise Ireland. I had a good meeting with a company that came to Ballinsloe through foreign direct investment. I have also met some indigenous companies there.I will mention some other points quickly because I am aware of the time constraints. Research and development is a key agenda for my Department. The programme for third-level research and education, which I was glad to initiate as Minister for Education and Science, and Science Foundation Ireland, which the Tánaiste initiated, have resulted in a change in the level, scale and quality of investment in research. From 1995 to 1999, €500 million was spent on research and development by the State, whereas from 2000 to 2006 some €2.5 billion is being spent on research and development. Over the next six years, we want to achieve the Lisbon target of 2.5% of GNP. I am chairing an intergovernmental committee on research and development. We set a task to prepare the road map and blueprint by mid-2005 by which we will achieve that 2.5% of GNP target, which involves both business and State expenditure. I want to know the physical incremental steps we must take to do things such as doubling the number of PhDs by the end of this decade.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	336	It is a challenging agenda for us but not one that can easily be achieved. I acknowledge that it is easy to set the target but I want to get the blueprint as to how we go about achieving it. I am satisfied that research and development is the crucial agenda for Ireland if we are to remain competitive in future.The centres for science, technology and engineering that come under the aegis of Science Foundation Ireland have brought world-class research to the country, including medical therapy, software engineering and nano-technology. Ultimately, they will have an impact on future products and services. A key element is the external peer review, whereby colleges must now submit strategic research to external review by panels. There is no favouritism or an inside tack — one must survive on the strength and quality of one's submission. That has brought about a change in the way universities prepare their submissions and thus organise themselves for future benefit.On the indigenous side, our main objective is the internationalisation of Irish companies, to which Senator White referred. We need to grow quickly the number of small and medium-size Irish companies. Enterprise Ireland, in particular, sees that as its agenda. The enterprise strategy group has provided clear recommendations on how that should be done, which the Government has endorsed. Enterprise Ireland is restructuring itself to give greater strength to its section that deals with internationalisation.Indigenous enterprise has had much success in the past ten years. Some of the criticisms of its performance have been rather harsh. According to a number of global measures, entrepreneurial activity in Ireland is probably the highest in Europe. Currently, one in 12 people working here is engaged in entrepreneurial activity. In the next ten years, we must bring that rate down to one in six, given the way the world economy is changing.Enterprise Ireland sees its remit as assisting and facilitating companies to grow and develop. A recent review of Enterprise Ireland's start-ups recorded that 76% of the 470 companies started since the early 1990s are actively trading today. They are achieving sales of €1 billion and employ approximately 7,500 people. There are measurable successes from the Enterprise Ireland stable of client companies and we see that as being particularly important. It is of equal importance to Science Foundation Ireland's future agenda.I referred to the approximately 130,000 jobs created by American investment here but Irish investment in the United States is creating up to 80,000 jobs. That fact is often overlooked.I will now conclude by thanking Senators for their tolerance in facilitating my contribution. Senator White referred to a lunch at which her company was one of those nominated for an award for being the meat on the bone in terms of what we have all been discussing here.

If I have to vote for one, I think the motion is slightly better than the amendment. We need to examine a number of issues.The Minister spoke at length about research and development but if he was in his previous job and examined the OECD report on third-level education, he would have seen that in recent times our investment in research and development is still way behind the European average. Two thirds of investment in research and development in third-level institutions comes from foreign-owned companies. That is a major problem. The Minister said our future is in added intellectual value, and I agree with him completely. The OECD report showed that Ireland has the lowest level of doctoral students in the EU, which is a matter of concern. It is also a major indictment of the Government that there is no university in the State north of a line between Dublin and Galway. I spoke in the House yesterday about the lack of vision in the OECD report. Senator Ormonde was in the House at the time. One of my concerns related to the complete lack of any discussion on e-learning and e-universities. The Minister agreed with me. The first advertisement I heard this morning just after the 6.30 a.m. news was one for the OU business college.

It was aimed at people in the business community who get up early. It came on again just before the business news on RTE. That is how far behind the times we are. It is that easy. Somebody needs to be kicked around on that one. That is a seriously important issue that we must examine.I appeal to my Fine Gael colleagues in regard to one issue. We should look carefully at the deterioration of employment in the manufacturing sector for one reason. Is anyone regretting this? I do not know anyone who looks forward to having his or her children work on the assembly lines of manufacturing industry. Those jobs are no longer in this country; they have all either been exported or else immigrant workers are coming here to do the jobs.I agree with the point in the motion on indigenous industry, raised by Senator John Phelan in particular, regarding the low level of growth in indigenous companies. I was interested in the Minister's final comment on that issue. He stated that a large number of foreign companies are now investing here. That is hugely important. There is a lack of doctoral level study and a lack of investment by indigenous companies in research and development at third level.I look forward to the employment permits Bill to which the Minister referred. It is crucial. We need to be firm on that. We should not be driven by any side of the argument except the need for skills in our economy. Whether we need forklift drivers, plumbers or university professors, they are all units of employment. We must look at what we need and bring in people to do it. There should be flexibility. We do not want to be embarrassed any further by the likes of today's newspaper headlines about the exploitation of Polish workers in the port tunnel. We saw enough of that happen to our own people in the past 100 years. We should not be involved in that kind of behaviour; neither should we allow any unscrupulous employers to take advantage of decent employers by allowing them to undercut through not paying their workers. Everybody loses in that scenario. Unscrupulous scoundrels should not be allowed to get away with wrongdoing. We need a controlled but flexible permits structure that will help us along the way.I was in a hospital ward today where every single person working there was non-Irish. I spoke to three or four patients who were completely happy. One does not find racism among hospital patients who are meeting and dealing with foreign workers. We have a great amount to do in this regard.I would have liked to see reference in the motion to the question of infrastructure, which is quite appalling. I take issue with the Government about the slow roll out of broadband. I do not care how many speeches the Minister makes. I live 17 miles away from here and I make the journey into the city several times every week so I can stand up here and have a go at someone when the opportunity arises, as it now does. I cannot get broadband 17 miles from here. What chance would I have in Achill or Belmullet? I might have a better chance in some cases. The reality is that there is no roll out of broadband and we are losing out to a significant degree. Areas which have broadband are in a position to develop. We must look at this issue as a matter of urgency.This is not about manufacturing industry; it is about intellectual added value. We need to think cleverly. We need to be able to operate companies from Ireland which might be manufacturing in Asia. We need management supervision from here. We need intellectual added value from here. That is how we will win. We should remember that we got ahead of the rest of Europe, not by accident but by a series of factors, one of which was our educational levels. We are being caught out in that now. Yesterday's figures and those to which I just referred about the need to have people at doctoral level are important, not because we need doctors but because we need people at that level to be the anchors for design, research and development. That is the reality. It is not a made up thing because we want to keep people in college for longer; it is a requirement. If we do not address the issue now we will start paying the price.In the same way as manufacturing industry, particularly the heavy manufacturing industry, is moving from this part of the world to the less developed part of the world, similarly, within a short period of time the top jobs that are currently here will also migrate to another part of the world.

#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The consistently positive news on employment in Ireland each quarter is no surprise given the favourable economic environment which the Government has created for economic growth and employment opportunities. Over the past seven years, in excess of 500,000 jobs have been created. The total number of persons employed is just short of a record 1.9 million. This equates to one person working for every two people in the economy.Ireland's performance in employment terms is the envy of Europe. Our unemployment rate fell from 15.7% in 1993 to just 3.6% in April 2001. It is now 4.4%. The most recent figures for the EU member states show Ireland's unemployment rate at 4.4% compared with an EU 15 average of8%, placing Ireland second only to Luxembourg. There is no doubt that current Government policies are contributing to Ireland's strong labour market performance. The Irish economy has been growing strongly for most of the past decade and has been at the top end of the European growth league, at least in the context of the 15 countries in the EU.There are a number of elements whose combined effect in the past decade or so has generated Ireland's exceptional employment and economic growth performance. These include low corporation taxes; the enhanced education status of the workforce; an increase in the labour force and reduction in the dependency ratio; the fiscal rectitude stance adopted by the Government and the favourable industrial development policy which successfully targeted multinationals in high growth sectors; social partnership which helped restrain wage growth in return for lower taxes; and increased competition in a number of important sectors, notably retail, telecoms, energy and air travel.As a result of the Government's economic strategy, Ireland's GNP per capita is now in line with the EU average. It is imperative that future economic policy continues to focus on reducing joblessness and getting people back to work. There is no room for complacency in these figures. Much more remains to be done. Of the 94,000 people unemployed in July 2004, 46% were aged between 20 and 34 and a further 16% were aged between 35 and 44.The one downside of our unemployment rate is that a tightening labour market gives rise to accelerating wage growth which drives business costs higher and results in higher inflation. However, there is some consolation in the recent population and labour force projections produced by the CSO which sees the labour force increasing by 40,000 to 50,000 per annum over the period to 2011.As somebody who has employed foreign direct labour through the permits system, I welcome the introduction of the permits Bill. It would be a great help to small businesses if language training were provided for those people who come here. There is a deficiency in this area at present.Despite the positive news on employment there remain weaknesses in the economy that have the potential to constrain economic and employment growth in future. Government policy needs to focus on two issues; our physical infrastructure deficit and competitiveness. We will create jobs in the economy only if firms and businesses are in a position to export to international markets. Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world. Our international players will survive if their cost base is in line with or lower than their international competitors. When one examines unemployment rates in Ireland and across Europe, one must conclude that a socialist Europe is an unemployed Europe.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This motion refers to the level of employment in Ireland; Ireland is a success story since there is very little unemployment. In comparison with our European partners, Ireland is a first-class model country, which fact is well established. There may be black spots but ten years ago, when I was dealing with young students' transition from school to work, we had difficulty finding jobs for them. However, having discussed the matter with colleagues in the world of work, there is now no difficulty getting jobs for people.I am delighted our strategy is working. Government policies are working in tackling unemployment. Nonetheless, I agree there are black spots which must be examined. The Minister has referred to these and to how we can best move forward by upskilling and reskilling people in this situation. This must be achieved through programmes such as the FÁS programme. I am glad the Minister referred to the research which is under way to discover how best the Government can ascertain the future skill needs. The Government's aim is that by 2010 Ireland will have a very good knowledge-based economy and we are moving in that direction.The House had a very good debate yesterday on the OECD report on how we can best interdepartmentalise to effectively bring forward education and training, to know where are the black spots and be ready when a business closes down so that we can move jobs from one area to another with little difficulty. The Minister has referred to this approach and the budget for this year acknowledges it. The Department is focusing on areas in which there is a lack of skills upgrading.I am glad that legislation will be introduced regarding work permits for immigrants because it has been very loosely applied. It is far better to introduce legislation to impose a structure on the system so that skills can be assessed when people arrive in Ireland to see how best they can be allocated to jobs suited to their education and skills. The Minister of State should take from this debate the fact that there is insufficient collaboration between the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. There is a variety of programmes at leaving certificate stage and vocational leaving certificate stage and one wonders how they are complemented in FÁS programmes. There are also issues in regard to lifelong learning. There are black spots in how we go about our work but we have a good story; let us sell it. This is a first-class country which is the envy of our EU partners. I am delighted to endorse this fine motion.Where we have to upskill and reskill, perhaps we should talk to industry and the business world to see how we can move forward on research and development, about which issue I could come into my own. It is in research and development that we will succeed in future, to which the OECD report referred. We must commit ourselves to it.

To address the broader perspective of cancer incidence, one in three people in this country will develop cancer. Another frightening statistic is that 60% of cancers will develop in the elderly. If this is the case, it is important we maintain cancer services on a regional basis and are not sucked into the madness of centralising cancer services, which is the mantra of many reports of recent years. Centralising cancer services is not the way forward and we must be careful not to go down that road.To be parochial, Letterkenny General Hospital needs a colorectal surgeon, a breast surgeon and a radiation oncologist. These appointments must be made in the short term. In conjunction with these services, a super-regional centre from where these services will operate is also needed.The leaked elements of the O'Higgins report suggest that breast cancer services will operate in a centralised manner. It has been insinuated that the north west will eventually link up with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. However, this will not be the case. The now defunct North Western Health Board exhausted every avenue in trying to link up with Altnagelvin Hospital. It is not good enough for reports to repeatedly state that north-west cancer services will be facilitated through that hospital or through Northern Ireland services. It is not and will not be the case and we must consider decentralising services.There is need for a full-time breast surgeon at Letterkenny General Hospital. Recent reports suggest it will take until 2007 for breast services to be relocated or decentralised to the west and north west. This is a scandal for the simple reason that in 2000 other areas had their breast screening services rolled out. That women between the ages of 50 and 64 living in the west and north west will not have these services in the short to medium term is a scandal, a disgrace and a matter which must be addressed in every possible way by the Government.While unnecessary bureaucracy is a problem, breast screening services must be rolled out. We cannot blame bureaucracy; we must believe there is political will, but many in the north west do not believe it exists. One frightening and glaring statistic is that cancer death rates can be reduced by 25% in women detected through a screening programme. These services do not exist in the west and north west and, therefore, the women who cannot avail of them are in more danger of developing cancer in comparison to their eastern counterparts. This is an absolute disgrace. People in the west and Donegal pay taxes. Do they not deserve a service that women in the east are receiving? This is a rhetorical question because it is a disgrace that women are faced with such a predicament.

In Northern Ireland alone there are four screening centres in Lurgan, Antrim, Belfast and Altnagelvin, spread out on a regional basis. Others areas in Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged by these services whereas the west and the north-west are so disadvantaged.No consultant radiation oncologist is visiting Letterkenny at present. This means patients must travel to Dublin on the N2-A5 road for treatment. This road is an infrastructural nightmare, although that is an issue for another day. The situation in Letterkenny is disgraceful. Cancer services must be addressed because one in three people will develop cancer. Some 25% of women will survive if they are screened properly.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The national roll out of the breast screening programme to the remaining counties is a major priority in the development of cancer services. The Department of Health and Children has been working collaboratively with BreastCheck and the two host hospitals involved in progressing the roll out. I welcome the opportunity to describe the Government's position on the programme and to outline in detail the different stages undertaken so far.The national breast screening programme commenced in the eastern and midland regions in February 2000. Screening is offered free of charge to women in the 50 to 64 age group. Since the programme commenced, cumulative funding of approximately €60 million and €12 million capital funding has been allocated to support the programme.In February 2003 the Minister for Health and Children announced the expansion of the current BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford. Screening commenced in Wexford in March 2004. BreastCheck expects to commence screening in Carlow in April 2005 and screening will follow in County Kilkenny when the first round of screening in Carlow is completed.In March 2003 the Minister announced the expansion of the programme to the remaining counties in the country. The national roll out required detailed planning for the development of essential infrastructure to provide for two clinical units, one in Cork and the other in Galway. This detailed planning involved considerable work by BreastCheck, University College Hospital, Galway, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, and the Department of Health and Children.The first stage of the development was the planning of the two static clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. This necessitated the establishment of two capital project teams to develop briefs for the units' construction. The former Western Health Board prepared detailed option appraisals for the BreastCheck development at University College Hospital, Galway. The brief proposals, with cost and phasing options, were then evaluated by the Department and the most appropriate option was selected.The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening service into current and future developments at the hospital. The Department made a capital grant of €230,000 available for the study to be undertaken by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. This study was completed in mid-2004 and proposals were submitted to the Department.After the evaluation of both briefs the Department was then in a position to determine the capital funding requirements for the progression of both developments. These requirements were considered in the context of the overall capital investment framework and, in September 2004, approval for a capital investment of approximately €21 million was given for the construction of the units. This investment will also provide for the mobile units which will be available to screen women throughout the country.Subsequent discussions took place between BreastCheck, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, the Western Health Board and the Department on design issues surrounding the development of the static units. It was decided to relocate and develop the symptomatic breast service back to back with the BreastCheck development at University College Hospital, Galway. In December 2004, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children approved additional capital funding of €3 million to support this development.It is intended to progress both of the developments at Cork and Galway simultaneously and it is anticipated that the advertisement for the appointment of a design team will be placed in the EU journal in the coming weeks. The Tánaiste is committed to the national expansion of the breast screening programme. The design, construction and commissioning of projects of this nature generally take approximately two and a half years. The Tánaiste is confident that the target date of 2007 for the national expansion will be met.

The Minister of State said the Tánaiste is confident that the target date of 2007 for the national expansion will be met. What indicators has the Tánaiste used that allow her to be as confident? It means nothing to me because, in 2002, the target date was 2005.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I accept the Senator's interest in the matter and I hoped I had explained the position sufficiently, but obviously not everyone is as satisfied with my answer. We have shown the commitment of the Government and the moneys it has made available in rolling out the programme nationally. In such situations there must be a beginning and an end. The last counties to be addressed will feel hard done by, but we have started. The mobile units to screen women will be available throughout the country.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking this motion regarding St. Mary's national school in Drumlish, County Longford, roll number 166655. It is a six-teacher school with four full-time members of the teaching staff, one learning support teacher and one part-time resource teacher for ten hours per week. With 84 pupils on the roll, the school employs a part-time secretary and cleaner as they lack the funding to retain the necessary full-time assistants. It lacks the funding to retain the very necessary full-time assistants. However, the nub of the matter is that the school cannot afford to pay even part-time staff as it receives only €10,414 per annum and needs a minimum of another €7,000 to pay for a full-time secretary and cleaner. In common with school principals around the country who must be all things to all people, the principal of St. Mary's finds that with the need for staff as outlined, the daily three hours of assistance provided by the secretary is quite inadequate to meet the school needs. If the school had the extra funding it could employ the secretary during the school holidays to catch up with important school work.It is unacceptable to expect the principal to fill the role of school secretary during the hours when the secretary is not there, but that is the reality. When I spoke to the principal this morning, not only was she teaching a class, carrying out her duty as principal, but she had taken three phone calls between 9.30 a.m. and 11.15 a.m. which took her away from her class. She also had to look after a sick pupil and clean up the classroom after the child vomited. This is not an uncommon occurrence, with school nurse duties being added to the work of the already overstretched principal.In no other sector would one person be expected to undertake so many roles. It is not surprising that the number of applications for the post of school principal has steadily fallen since 1996 and that several schools have no principal because nobody wants the job. A position advertised in any other sector which requires one person to be a teacher, an administrator, a personal manager, a caretaker, a social worker and a nurse would have no takers. I am sure the Minister of State agrees, yet this is what we expect of our school principals. They are not given the funding to employ the necessary back-up services.The part-time cleaner in St. Mary's is employed only on Wednesdays and Saturdays so the pupils must empty classroom bins at the end of each day to ensure an acceptable standard of hygiene and cleanliness in the school. No school can operate without the necessary backup and St. Mary's is no exception. With demands on funding for essential extra resources, learning supports and audiovisual equipment, which are the backbone of any modern teaching environment, it is shameful to see money diverted into the provision of services which should be provided as a matter of course.I ask the Minister of State to make up the shortfall in funding for St. Mary's national school and to allow the principal and teachers to have the time and necessary backup to get on with the job they do best, namely, teaching the children in Drumlish. I compliment and thank the principal, Ms Elizabeth Brady, the board of management, the teachers, staff, students and their parents for the wonderful work they are doing in St. Mary's school. Despite the funding difficulties and the day-to-day struggle for necessary resources, this is a happy and motivated learning environment. I hope the Minister of State will take note of what I have said and facilitate the school. A very small sum is needed to give the necessary backup to the principal and her staff, a mere €7,000 per annum. I plead with the Minister of State to give due consideration to the request and I hope his response contains good news.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment as it affords me an opportunity to advise the House of the position with regard to the provision made by the Department of Education and Science in respect of secretarial and cleaning services in primary schools.The Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which the Department meets the full cost of the salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant, under which St. Mary's national school, Drumlish, receives funding.The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is by its nature flexible and gives boards of management discretion regarding which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 in 2002 to €133 this year. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of €7,980 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or fewer and a maximum grant of €66,500 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, provided the school in question does not already have either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme.Where a school already has either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme, the rate of grant payable will be €66.50 per pupil and the minimum and maximum grants payable are €3,990 and €33,250, respectively. It is expected that the appropriate amount of grants at the revised rate will be issued to all primary schools in March, including St. Mary's national school, Drumlish.The running costs of primary schools have been traditionally met by the Department's scheme of capitation grants which are the main source of funding for those running costs. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges, and represent a major source of funding for primary schools. The scheme of funding is flexible in nature and affords boards of management discretion as to how the funding is used in meeting a school's day-to-day running costs.The capitation grant to primary schools has also been increased substantially in recent years. The standard capitation grant at primary level, which stood at £45 (€57.14) in 1997, increased to €121.58 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2004 and is being increased by a further €12.00 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2005, bringing it to €133.58 per pupil. This represents an increase of almost 134% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997. The first payment of the capitation grant for the current school year was issued by electronic funds transfer to the bank account of each recognised primary school on 21 January 2005. The latest increase in the rate of both the ancillary services grant and the capitation grant will be of assistance to all primary schools in meeting their running costs, including the costs associated with the provision of secretarial and cleaning services, and is a reflection of the Government's commitment to further improving funding to the education sector.I thank the Senator again for raising this matter in the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I think the Minister of State is a former teacher or was involved with the teaching profession. Does he think it totally inadequate to offer any school €10,000 per annum to pay a salary to both a secretary and a cleaner in this day and age? The schools are totally underfunded. The Government needs to look at this area.
