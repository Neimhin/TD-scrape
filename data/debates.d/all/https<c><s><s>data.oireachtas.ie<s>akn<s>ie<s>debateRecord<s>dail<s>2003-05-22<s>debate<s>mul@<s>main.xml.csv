#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I am opposed to taking the Order of Business. I have here the official Government request for pairs today. It shows that the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Dea, de Valera, O'Malley, and Deputy Power are attending events in Clare with the Taoiseach. The House of Parliament sits at a time of great political uncertainty. The Taoiseach confirmed yesterday that the matter of the unseemly squabble between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil in respect of the third level fees issue would be dealt with before the leaving certificate begins. Next week is the last week the Dáil will sit before the leaving certificate starts and I want confirmation from the Tánaiste that this House will have a proper opportunity to debate the row that is going on between the parties in Government. They fight on every television programme and in the Seanad, where the Minister for Education and Science attacked the Fianna Fáil Leader of the Seanad yesterday, aided and abetted by the leader of the Progressive Democrats in the Seanad, Senator Dardis, on this issue. Everybody is talking about it but the two parties in Government are not talking to each other.Before we deal with the business before us today, can I get confirmation from the Tánaiste that, first, there will be clarity from Government on the issue of third level fees and that there will be no re-introduction of these fees or imposition of charges of up to €8,000 on parents for every student; and second, that this House will be given Government time next week to debate the proposals by the Government on third level fees?We have this carry on every Thursday morning. Four or five Ministers are attending events in County Clare with the Taoiseach while the national Parliament sits at time when a report in the Tánaiste's Department indicates that up to 800 jobs per week have been lost every week since this Government came into office, when the Government has brought about a position where we are now the most expensive country in the euro zone and when we have slipped out of the top ten in international competitiveness ratings. This has proven to be a Government of broken promises and panic-stricken actions.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	14	On behalf of the Labour Party, I also seek a guarantee from the Tánaiste on this. I welcome the Tánaiste back. We have not seen her for a little while but she is very welcome. Before this matter is dealt with we would like, and have already sought, a guarantee that the proposal by the Minister for Education and Science to re-introduce third level fees will be debated in this House next week.The reason is very clear. As Deputy Kenny has pointed out, this issue is being debated across the country. It is a matter of some anxiety for parents and students who are about to sit their leaving certificate exams. The fact that the Government is riven in two on this issue does not do anything for the peace of mind of the electorate. That the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach seem to be unable to discuss this matter or that the Cabinet seems unable to discuss it, indicates some kind of dysfunctional relationship between the two parties, which does not reassure the public. We have not had a chance to debate this, a central issue in education, in this House even though it has now been discussed in the Seanad. It is being discussed everywhere else but the national Parliament.It is important that the Tánaiste give this undertaking. We are running out of time. We have one week left and if we do not get to debate this in Government time next week, young people will go in to sit their leaving certificate exams in a state of uncertainly and concern because the Government cannot get its act together and cannot defend the interests of students who are seeking third level education that would be of benefit to them, yes, but also of benefit to us as a society.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I remind Deputies that the proposal before the House is for the late sitting.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I am dealing with the late sitting. It is important to bear in mind that we have already heard two concurrent views on the need for a debate. We in the Green Party called for a debate on the issue of third level fees and the plans, lack of plans, confused plans or differing plans from the Government in that issue. There has been no mention so far of the agreement to have such a debate and we cannot agree to the Order of Business until that is clarified. We cannot disappoint students, some of whom have been in the Public Gallery and have left already, and who are effectively on an educational death row wondering how long it will be before their case will be heard.The Minister said that he would have this matter dealt with in January and then said he would have it clarified by Easter. It is a long time to wait to know one's fate and the Government has an obligation to tell the country what the plan is so that we can have a frank debate about the issue in this House.

The longer the delay in offering clarification on the Government's intention vis-à-vis the re-introduction of third level college fees or some sort of loan scheme, the more we add to the distress and burden of concern on young people facing their exams.None of us have the detail at all of what the Minister is proposing. Where has it ever been explained to us that disadvantaged students or young people from disadvantaged areas of this jurisdiction will be empowered in terms of taking up third level places? Nothing has been explained and this total vacuum is grossly insulting to the Members of this House and very offensive to the wider public. It is this evening that we want to see this clarity, not at some later point in the coming week. We can agree to an extension of time but let us use it wisely and sensibly and clear up this continual fudge on the part of the Government and the exchange between the Tánaiste's party and Fianna Fáil in Cabinet.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	18	What we are dealing with here is the late sitting and it is important that the Dáil sit later this evening to deal with important matters of business. On the issue raised by the Deputies opposite, they have Private Members' time at their disposal if they wish to raise any issue. The Taoiseach already indicated during Leaders' Questions in this House yesterday that the intention is to bring clarity to the matter raised before the leaving certificate begins.

The clock is ticking on the issue of third level fees. The Government's numbers in the vote would have been five higher if the Taoiseach's cavalcade was not proceeding around County Clare. I hope they are travelling under the speed limit in orderly fashion to Dromoland Castle for their lunch. Deputies Killeen and Breen are here for some strange reason – they are doing their constitutional duty by representing their people in the Parliament.I oppose the Friday sitting. I seek confirmation from the Tánaiste that the House will sit the week after the bank holiday weekend, as there is no reason it should not. I seek confirmation if possible from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the issue raised by Deputy Coveney regarding the Government's position on the Irish Box. It relates to the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill.I oppose tomorrow's sitting without confirmation on those issues.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Labour Party also opposes this sitting. It is not acceptable to us that the Government is trying to create the impression that substituting Friday sittings for proper sitting days meets the need for proper debate in the House and to deal with serious issues.The Government proposes to close the House for a week, which is totally unnecessary. We ask the Government to ensure we return for that week to debate the issues of the day and carry out our work as legislators. We do not accept that a sanitised Friday sitting, as proposed by the Government, is any substitute for the rigorous work we are supposed to do. On Fridays there is no Order of Business, no Leaders' Questions, no questions to the Taoiseach, no ordinary questions to Ministers or Private Notice Questions, no Adjournment Debate and no votes. That is not parliamentary practice as it is known in the Dáil.I ask the Tánaiste to live up to her commitments to accountability. We have had many lectures on accountability from the Progressive Democrats over the years.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Green Party is opposed to the Friday sitting under the terms proposed by the Government. The Tánaiste has already told us that if we are concerned about third level fees, we should use our Private Members' time, which is available to us about once every three months. That is a derisory suggestion.We should be able to provide the time and if the Government was not afraid of dealing with the issue it would make the time available so that this could be clarified. That would be for the greater good of the public, which cannot say what the Government's plan is other than that the Administration is menacing whatever way it moves. We should look again at the Friday sitting and make it a proper parliamentary sitting. It is not appropriate to have a sitting in which there is no Order of Business and no votes. It is a sham and it does the House no good to engage in that kind of sham politics. I ask for a proper Friday sitting in which we have an Order of Business and voting.

I ask the Tánaiste to indicate that she and the Taoiseach will ensure that the issue of third level fees will be included in the business for tomorrow. I appeal to the Tánaiste and hope she is as anxious as everyone else to have this matter finally and substantively addressed.Deputy Sargent mentioned sham politics, and there is an awful lot of it in evidence in the House. On one hand the Labour Party is always complaining that the Taoiseach is not here to answer questions on Thursdays, yet it was that party which facilitated his absence.

Day after day Fine Gael Members are instructed not to vote to facilitate the Government. That is sham opposition and the people deserve an awful lot better than that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I wish to explain to Deputy Ó Caoláin, who probably has not been here long enough to understand the mechanics of how the House operates, that this party accepts that Government has to do its duty and has always accepted that Ministers away on legitimate business on behalf of the Government should be paired. We have always stood by that agreement in the interests of the country carrying out its affairs properly. For Deputy Ó Caoláin's information, the people who are in County Clare in the Taoiseach's entourage are not paired by this party because their absence from the House is not on Government business on behalf of the people. Talking about sham politics, he might tell us where the half tonne of semtex is buried.

The Central Bank is primarily responsible for the control of price inflation. Today, we discover that 60% of our price inflation is coming directly from Government. If the Government was not involved, inflation would be below the European average and we would not have the competitiveness problems that have been eroding employment and taking money out of people's pockets, which they can ill-afford. Why has the Government not brought forward this Bill? Why have we not seen debated in this House the anti-inflation package from Government which is an entire sham? It is clear the Government is creating inflation and the lack of competitiveness and not the private sector or any other agent in the State.

A memo will be taken to the Government shortly with the heads of the critical infrastructure Bill. The policy regarding the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill is being reviewed by the Minister for Transport.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Will the Tánaiste state when a Bill to facilitate appeals against decisions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will be introduced, as promised?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The competitiveness issue has been raised already. When will the Bord Bia Bill be introduced? This issue concerns the amalgamation of two key marketing areas in which Ireland is not performing. We import more than 70% of organic produce consumed here. Will the Tánaiste reconsider and bring this legislation forward so we can, I hope, do away with it? It is a bad move to amalgamate two marketing bodies when the country needs to market more.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The amalgamation of the bodies is a good idea and it is already Government policy. The heads of the Bill are due to come before the Cabinet very shortly.

Does the Tánaiste agree that it is regrettable that this House could not solve the problem in recent months despite repeated suggestions to do so from this side of the House and that we have to go to the Judiciary to protect farm interests? Will the Tánaiste inform me if the Minister will comply with the instruction? She might indicate the position of the Government?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Questions must relate to promised legislation.

No effort has been made to address the problem. The Tánaiste might be interested in outlining her view on the matter.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I have two questions on education. The Grangegorman development agency Bill, the higher education authority (amendment) Bill and the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children Bill have been promised. That is the sum total of the relevant Bills on the list. Given that we have been listening to lectures by the Minister for Education and Science, can we expect a Bill to deal with social disadvantage in education or will we have a Bill setting up a loans system to pay for the fees the Minister wants to reintroduce?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Another one gone from the socialist wing of the Labour Party.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	75	At a time when Kathy Sinnott is in the Oireachtas presenting a case on behalf of children with autism and in view of the fact that the Government promised, the day after the Kathy Sinnott judgment, that there would be an education for persons with disabilities Bill, when will this Bill be debated in the House? Time and again, we receive promises but they are not delivered on. Will the Tánaiste declare exactly when we will debate this Bill so people with disabilities get some chance of equality?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The heads of that Bill were approved by the Government recently and it will be published before the summer.

Given that 22 people lost their lives in 2002 and a further eight have been killed on building sites since her commitment last February, what are the Government's plans now that the month of April has passed and that this essential legislation has yet to be presented?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The heads of that Bill were passed a considerable time ago and the Bill will be published this year. I cannot give the Deputy a precise date. Enforcement of the current law has a huge role to play in health and safety in the workplace.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Taoiseach stated on the Order of Business on two occasions this week that there was no review of secondary legislation on the groceries order. Outside the House, the Tánaiste said that a review was taking place. What is the position?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I think the Taoiseach said that no legislation was promised in this area, which is a fact. However, as the Deputy knows, every issue is being examined, including the anti-inflation strategy, which is the responsible thing to do.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Taoiseach said there was no review.

There is no legislation promised in this area, and that may be what the Taoiseach said.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	87	What about secondary legislation?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The education of persons with disabilities Bill will be published first and I think the other Bill will be later this year.

Does she intend to introduce any legislation in that regard given that her colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, has slashed the funding for the local Northside Partnership local employment service by more than 30%?On the telecommunications Bill, is the Tánaiste alarmed at the communications industry reports on the massive profits being enjoyed by people in the mobile phone sector, a factor that must be considered in terms of the cost base of the economy getting totally out of control? Is she prepared to make any representations to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Is any legislation promised?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	94	There is no legislation promised in regard to the local employment service. Telecommunications legislation is promised for autumn of this year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	96	That question is not in order. When will the Bill be introduced?

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Last summer at a meeting in Grangegorman, the Taoiseach made a commitment that legislation would be introduced in the autumn on the Grangegorman project for the Dublin Institute of Technology because it could not go ahead without this. Given that the Dublin Institute of Technology has had its plans drawn up for the several years, can the Tánaiste indicate when that legislation is going to go through? The provision of student facilities or the transfer of facilities from the Dublin Institute of Technology's present accommodation to that new campus cannot take place until legislation is introduced. It has been delayed for at least six months. We have received promises in the past that it will come forward at some point. Will we see it before the summer?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	102	No, we will not, and I cannot give a date for when we will see it.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Tánaiste might remind the Taoiseach that he promised this legislation. It will be at least 12 months later than he promised. This is in his own constituency which makes the delay all the more surprising.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	104	This time last year the Government promised that 200,000 more people would have medical cards. A year later 30,000 people have lost their medical cards. Now that the Government has a new social conscience can the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Health and Children when the health (complaints) Bill will come before the Dáil? I hope that people who lost their medical cards can be represented in this Bill.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The heads of the Bill are expected later this year and the Bill will be published next year.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I do not know whether to call the Minister for Education and Science Madame Rosa as a visionary or Karl Marx as a new-found socialist. Now that the Minister is so committed to ensuring that people from disadvantaged areas have access to better education at all levels can the Tánaiste say when he is going to put sufficient money in place to ensure that school attendance officers can do their job and not just sit in offices?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The Deputy must ask about promised legislation.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Minister for Education and Science says this issue is his main priority but as far as I can see that legislation cannot operate because of Government cutbacks.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Given the serious backlog that now exists in the courts, the serious logjam in the family law courts, and the complete inadequacy of the system to deal with the workload that exists, what is happening to the courts Bill? Hopefully, this Bill will deal with this urgent and pressing situation which has been ongoing for almost the entire life of this Government and its predecessor.

In light of the fact that Dublin city centre is now a "no go" area because O'Connell Street has become the most dangerous street in Ireland, where women are afraid to get into taxis because of the absence of any regulation of standards, when will we see the taxi regulation Bill ? Second, when will we see the greater Dublin area land use and transportation authority Bill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I dealt with the latter Bill earlier when I said that the policy was under review by the Minister for Transport.

In page 3, line 15, to delete "the Arts Act, 2002 " and substitute "Acht an Ealaíon 2003".Is é atá mé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ins an leasú seo ná tús áite a thabhairt i gcónaí do theideal Gaeilge Bhille, toisc gurb í an Ghaeilge príomh theanga na tíre, de réir an Bhunreachta. In aon Acht, fiú agus é i mBéarla, ba chóir go mbéadh teideal oifigiúil na reachtaíochta i nGaeilge. Is é ba chóir a bheith anseo ná An Acht Ealaíon 2003. Le tamall anuas tá an Ghaeilge ag dul siar ón áit cheart ar chóir a bheith aici maidir le páipéarachas, le stáiseanóireacht agus le haon rud eile a bhaineann leis an Stát chóras. Feicimid i gcónaí go mbíonn an teideal Gaeilge ar chomharthaí bóithre, mar shampla, níos lú ná an teideal Bhéarla nó gurb é an tarna teideal a léitear. Ní bhfaigheann an Ghaeilge tús áite ar chóir di a fháil de réir an Bhunreachta. Agus muid ag déileáil leis an mBille seo agus ag smaoineamh ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigúla, a bhéas os comhair na Dála i gceann cupla uair a chloig agus a thabharfaidh stádas cuí don nGaeilge sa Stát choras, ba chóir glacadh leis an leasú seo.Aontaím lena bhfuil molta i leasú a 2 ach b'fhéidir gur chóir Acht Chomhairle na nEalaíon 2003 a bheith ann seachas Arts Council Act 2003. Má fhéachtar ar an mBille atá os ár gcomhair feictear nach bhfuil sé ag déileáil leis na healaíona iontu féin. Níl i gceist ach conas an Chomhairle Ealaíon a bhunadh, conas í a ríarú, conas mar a chaitheann an chomhairle leis an Teach seo agus conas mar a chaitheann an t-Aire leis an gcomhairle. Beidh an chomhairle ag déileáil leis na healaíona, ar ndóigh, ach ní Bille chun cur chun cinn na n-ealaíon atá anseo ach Bille chun comhairle nua a bunadh.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	125	We have arrived at Report Stage after a long, drawn-out period of consultation and the discussion of various reports, a long Second Stage in this House and a Committee Stage that took three days. The initial contents of the Bill have been watered down considerably. Various recommendations were made towards a new framework and a review of arts legislation in the discussion paper first published in 2000 that went out to all interest groups. The large number of recommendations and questions raised therein were certainly not included in this Bill.The report compiled by Theo Dorgan on the submissions received in response to Towards a New Framework for the Arts, which numbered in excess of 230; the report backed by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the strategic review of the arts plan 1995-98; The Creative Imperative: A Report on Support for the Individual Artist in Ireland; and a report on the music industry, together with a number of other reports, have all come together. We must consider this Bill on Irish arts legislation in that context as these reports prompted the former Minister to introduce it.Most of the recommendations contained in the various reports are not reflected at all in the Bill's contents. It is inaccurate to call it the Arts Bill 2002. It should be called the Arts Council Bill 2002 as it deals essentially with the workings of that organisation, its future relationship with the Minister and the abandonment, more or less, of the arm's length approach, except when it comes to grants – and there is even a question mark about that. It also deals to some extent with membership of the Arts Council, which I understand the Minister will be changing to 12 rather than eight, only five fewer than in the original Bill.The Bill does not really deal with anything else. The standing committees proposed, which some people regarded as innovative, have now been scrapped. We are left with special committees which the Arts Act 1973 could have allowed for. If this is to be a real Arts Act, it should include reference to the country's major cultural institutions, such as the National Concert Hall, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Theatre, the National Gallery, the Chester Beatty Library, the National Museum and the proposed new national centre for the performing arts, which will now probably not proceed. The Bill should have made more expansive reference to the Irish language. It certainly cannot be regarded as an Arts Act. It makes no mention whatsoever of the individual artist – surely any Arts Bill worthy of the name should make some provision for or reference to the individual artist.If one examines the previous two Acts, one sees that the present Bill does not differ greatly, apart from the issues of Arts Council membership and the arm's length approach. Let us look at legislation in other jurisdictions. The United Kingdom has the Arts Council of Great Britain Acts 1946, 1967 and 1994. There is the Australia Council Act 1975, the Arts Council (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Act 1994. Other jurisdictions refer to this legislation as the Arts Council Acts. To have an accurate reflection of content in the title, this Bill should also be called the Arts Council Act.Former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, reflecting on the Arts Act 1973, and expressing disappointment with its content, said that we needed a much more expansive piece of legislation to reflect the arts in this country. The arts in this country have certainly moved on a great deal over the past 30 years. Now, more than ever, we need the type of expansive legislation to which Mr. Haughey referred. I suggest to the Minister – he can accept this – that the Bill should be called the Arts Council Bill 2002 and the subsequent Act the Arts Council Act 2003.

Caithfidh mé a rá freisin go mbeidh an tAcht féin ar fáil as Gaeilge chomh maith. Tá neart sa Bhille seo. Leathnaíonn sé na cumhachtaí a bheidh ag an Aire agus ag na comhairlí ar fud na tíre. Nuair a bheidh an Bille seo ar fáil mar Acht, is é mo thuairim féin go mbeimid in ann na healaíona in Éirinn a chur ar aghaidh agus a chur chun cinn.The advice I have received is that because the Bill is written in English, it is appropriate that its title be in English too. Additionally, I should say that the legislation will of course be available in Irish. The argument that the legislation itself deals only with the Arts Council is not correct. For example, the Minister's powers are laid out in this legislation. So too are the functions of local authorities in so far as they affect the arts. One must also remember that the legislation makes very definitive statements regarding the Minister's policy functions and his powers in that respect.It is also important that I point out that there is already legislation on our Statute Book dealing with the cultural institutions. Should it become necessary to make amendments to facilitate their further growth, it would be appropriate to enact legislation amending that. It would not be appropriate to introduce provisions in the Arts Bill dealing with the cultural institutions when they have legislation of their own.

Ba chóir dúinn tús a chur leis an gcleachtadh go mbeadh sé scríofa mar sin ins an Acht nuair a foilsíter é i mBéarla agus Arts Act 2003 i lúibiní in aice leis, má's gá.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Regarding local authorities, the Minister mentioned that there was provision in this Bill which was not in previous Bills. One of the features of the 1973 Bill was that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, introduced an amendment to the 1951 Act giving a role to local authorities in the promotion of the arts. It is already catered for in the 1973 Act. I agree with the Minister that if we want to roll out the arts to all parts of the country, local authorities are a very important vehicle and should be supported more, especially in terms of funding.The main provision in this Bill is the changing of the Minister's role in regard to the Arts Council. The membership of the Arts Council was supposed to be reduced to a small number. The standing committees which created so much controversy have all been changed. The thrust of the Bill is to move from a position where there was clear State support to one where there is an inference of State control. In regard to the future direction of the arts in this country, that is a dangerous departure. While I outlined on Committee Stage the various reasons I thought so and do not want to repeat myself here, that is my greatest reservation regarding this legislation.

In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:" ‘Act of 2001' means the Local Government Act 2001;".Section 6 of the Bill provides that a local authority shall prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts and provide such financial or other assistance as it considers appropriate in relation to the arts within its functional area. The effect of this amendment is to provide that where the term "local authority" is used in the Bill, it shall mean city and county councils rather than all local authorities.The term "local authority" as defined in the Local Government Act 2001 extends to 114 local authorities, including former town commissioners and town councils. I am advised that it would not be appropriate to apply this provision to these smaller bodies which have more limited functions. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend this provision so that it applies to city councils and county councils only. These are the bodies which currently have a local arts function and engage arts officers.

It has contributed considerably to the development of the arts in the town. For example, the St. John's arts and heritage centre was originally a council initiative. The Minister might clarify whether this amendment will rule out the involvement of a local town council such as Listowel's. Is this measure only for county and city councils such as those in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway? Will it take from towns such as Listowel which played such an important role in developing the arts?Listowel is just an example of what is happening in towns across the country. Local town councils could have an important influence on the promotion of the arts locally. The Minister should explain how town councils would be affected by this amendment in regard to their promotion of the arts.

However, the legislation will limit the obligations under the legislation to the local authorities which I have mentioned. In other words, there will be an obligation under the legislation on local authorities, as defined, to prepare and implement the development of the arts within their functional areas and, in so doing, take account of the policies of the Government in regard to the arts. That obligation will apply to the local authorities, which are city and county councils rather than all local authorities.While the obligation will be confined, no restrictions are being placed on other local councils in terms of their desire to develop the arts. In that regard, I am well aware of the excellent work which has been carried out by Listowel urban council in relation to the arts over the years.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 3, line 24, after "interpretative" to insert "theory, conception, process, practice or".The Labour Party put forward this amendment to ensure that theory is included in the interpretation of the Bill. My party feels that the present reading of the Bill is such that theory is not included, an aspect of the arts which must be addressed. While the parliamentary counsel clearly felt he had all angles covered regarding this aspect, we do not agree. Theory has not been included and that must be addressed.I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. It is important in drafting the Bill that we give all aspects of the arts due recognition. That has not been done in regard to this section of the Bill. The Minister should accept the amendment to ensure that theory is included in this section.In proposing to delete "whether traditional or contemporary" in amendment No. 5, we are not trying to delete traditional arts from the Bill. It is too simplistic to define the arts as being either traditional or contemporary. There is a need to delete these words from the Bill because it should not contain a strict definition of contemporary or traditional arts. The Minister should consider deleting that aspect of the Bill.

The words are superfluous because the Bill defines the meaning of "arts". I have brothers who play in a band called Kíla. There are those who would call it traditional while others would call it contemporary but under this definition they are either one or the other. There are many art forms which we cannot conveniently slot into traditional or contemporary and the Bill would be improved by the deletion of "whether traditional or contemporary". That is not to say we are deleting traditional arts from the Bill. I am in favour of the new positions being adopted in the Bill which will ensure that traditional arts and, I hope, Irish language arts get the recognition they deserve and which they did not get over the past 30 years. The Arts Council gave financial support to traditional arts over the years which many people enjoy. The inclusion of this term does not help the definition required.On amendment No. 6, there is a need for proper recognition of the Irish language to be specific. The practice by State boards etc. is to leave it to one side, exclude it or regard the Irish language as an afterthought. Is gá dúinn a bheith ag déanamh cinnte go bhfuil na dualgais atá ar aon eagras Stáit i leith na Gaeilge scríofa go soiléir in aon Acht a ritear, in aon reachtaíocht agus in aon dualgas a chuireann an Phairlimint seo ar a leithéid de eagras. Iarraim arís ar an Aire glacadh le leasú an Teachta Deenihan agus leis an leasú a mhol mé féin agus an Teachta Wall. Má déantar sin beidh Bille níos fearr againn agus míniú níos soiléire ann ar na healaíona tradisiúnta agus eile.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister responded by saying he was advised that the existing text already accommodated art forms and artists using Irish, English or any other language, hence there was no necessity to accept the amendment. Since then I have been advised by those who asked me to table the amendment that they were not happy with the explanation that it would not alter the context of the Bill in any way. They asked me to resubmit the amendment and appeal to the Minister to allay their fears because those who are involved in promoting the Irish language at various levels have concerns about various aspects. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, they would like more clarity in respect of some of the definitions of the Irish language. The Minister now has an opportunity to allay those fears.In respect of the definition, on Committee Stage I mentioned that "new technologies" should be included after the word "dance". I asked the Minster's officials to discuss the matter with the parliamentary counsel but I note it has not been included. I had expected an amendment from the Minister to that effect. With the widespread use of new technologies in music composition, for example, new technologies should be included in the definition. The Minister will have another opportunity when the Bill goes to the Seanad but I advise him to include "new technologies" now because of the changes in the whole approach to music composition. I ask him to seriously consider adding "new technologies" after "dance", which would make the definition of the arts far more inclusive. Perhaps the Minister will refer to that in his reply.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I support the amendments in the name of my colleague, Deputy Wall. To deal with amendment No. 5, there is a real problem with the term "traditional or contemporary" because the Bill does not seek to define what is traditional and contemporary. It would be extraordinarily difficult to do that. The way the definition is presented could be a hindrance in the future. It excludes the possibility of cross-over between contemporary and traditional, an area dealt with adequately by Deputy Ó Snodaigh in his contribution. It also excludes the development of new art forms. For instance, was Riverdance contemporary or traditional? Terminology is being included in the definition which introduces a lack of clarity to the existing definition.On amendment No. 4, in any definition of art we must provide for more than just expression. We should provide for theory, an important aspect of art. We want to include the words "theory, conception, process and practice" in the Bill. A substantial argument cannot be made against this amendment and I ask the Minister to explain the reason art can be described only as meaning any creative interpretative expression while excluding theory from that definition.In regard to the Fine Gael Party amendment in the name of Deputy Deenihan, the House will debate the Official Languages Bill later today. If, as the Minister has indicated, the position is that the official languages are included in the definition, I would be happy to accept it. Too much can be added to definitions and can lead to a lack of clarity or changes which are difficult to comprehend. Whereas amendment No. 4, tabled by the Labour Party, seeks to delete terminology and amendment No. 5 seeks to include further terminology, my consistent view has been that definitions should be kept as short as possible, while addressing all relevant issues.

We have taken advice from the parliamentary counsel in regard to the wording in the legislation. I am strongly advised that the draft form before the Members is adequate to cover all art forms during the creative process and beyond. In addition, it is important to recognise that certain art forms are neither contemporary nor traditional but straddle both categories. By inserting this definition we have ensured that no art form is excluded. It is also important in that context that we do not confine the definition of an art form to the official languages of the State. We should make provision for increasing multi-culturalism and the likelihood that there will be art forms in other languages, which is precisely what the definition does in that it is sufficiently broad to encompass all art forms.On Deputy O'Shea's question regarding theory, it is clear theory must be expressed. In these circumstances, the definition set out in the legislation is adequate and I commend it to the House.

The proposed amendments would not radically alter the Bill or reduce its effectiveness. They aim to improve the Bill and are not intended to be divisive. I appeal to the Minister to consult the various organisations and groups with an interest in the Irish language as he would discover that our proposals are not out of line as he appears to be suggesting, but would add to the Bill.

In page 5, line 4, after "arts" to insert "in both official languages of the State".Tá an leasú seo ceangailte le leasaithe a bhí os ár gcomhair roimhe seo. Is é an rud a deir an Bille ná go ndéanfaidh an t-Aire na healaíona a gcur chun cinn laistigh den Stát agus lasmuigh de. Táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh dualgas ar leith ar an Aire, sa chás seo, na healaíona traidisiúnta agus ealaíona na linne seo a gcur chun cinn ins an dá theanga oifigiúla. Tá chomhionannas don dá theanga, ar a laghad, i gceist ins an cur chun cinn seo. Chuirfeadh seo leis an seasamh atá ag an nGaeilge agus ag na healaíona Gaeilge agus léireodh sé, go háirithe lasmuigh den Stát, go bhfuilimid bródúil as ár dteanga agus nach teanga den dara grád í.Ba cheart go mbeadh billeoga a chuireann na healaíona chun cinn ar fáil go héasca i nGaeilge. Tá roinnt eagrais Stáit a dhéanann sin agus is féidir teacht, go han-tapaidh, ar bhilleoga Gaeilge ar ghnéithe den Stát chóras nó de pholasaí an Stáit. I gcásanna eile ní féidir teacht ar litríocht dhá theangach agus ní bhíonn deis an Ghaeilge a cloisint nuair atá na healaíona á gcur chun cinn thar lear nó sa tír seo fiú. Déantar an dochar is mó ó thaobh pholasaí an Stáit i leith na Gaeilge nuair nach bhfuil sí curtha chun cinn ar chomhchéim i ngach uile bhealach. Tá deis againn anois é a cheangal isteach san mBille seo go mbeidh dualgas ar an Aire an Ghaeilge a cur chun cinn nuair atá sé nó sí ag cur na healaíona chun cinn. Bedh dualgas ar an Aire an Béarla a chur chun cinn chomh maith, ar ndóigh, mar tá dhá theanga oifigiúla againn. Is é polasaí an Stáit an dátheangachas a chur chun cinn sa Stát.Ba chóir don Aire glacadh leis an leasú seo, más féidir in aon chor é. Tá na scríbhinní a tháinig ón Roinn Sláinte agus Leanaí le déanaí, mar shampla, go hiomlán i mBéarla. Tá an páipéarachas atá ag the General Medical Services Division of the Department of Health and Children go hiomlán i mBéarla, cé go bhfuil sin go hiomlán i gcoinne pholasaí gach Rialtais a bhí ag an Stát seo ariamh. Tá an rud céanna fíor maidir leis an Eastern Regional Health Authority. Ní hamháin nach bhfuil an teideal Gaeilge ar aon tomhas leis an mBéarla ach níl sé ann ar chor ar bith. Tá mé ag amharc anois ar litir a tháinig chugam féin ach tá an seoladh agus gach uile rud i mBéarla. Sin an sort ruda a bhfuil mé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh cinnte de nach dtarlódh sé amach anseo. Bíodh an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla comhionann, ar a laghad, ins an mbealach a chuirtear na healaíona chun cinn.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I outlined the reasons the amendment should be included when I dealt with amendment No. 6. The Irish language is part of the ongoing organic development of the arts in this country. The Irish language is part of artistic innovation and growth in the Gaeltacht areas. Interest in the Irish language among Irish communities across the world is growing. It is now common to have Irish language classes in places such as New York, Boston and Chicago. It is important to specify that when the Minister is promoting arts both inside and outside the State both official languages should be used on all promotional material. I do not see any reason the Minister cannot accept my amendment and that proposed by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I understand where both Deputies are coming from as regards the two amendments. Amendment No. 12 states "both inside the State and outside it". If the Minister of the day was not fluent in the Irish language, unlike the current Minister, and wanted to promote Ireland when he or she was overseas, it could lead to translation difficulties. It could cause problems if the Minister of the day could not converse in Irish. If the Minister of the day wanted to write to the Bolshoi Ballet, for example, to invite it to come here for a State visit, should he or she issue the invitation in the Irish language, the English language or in both? If it was written in the Irish language, how would that help to promote it? There are non-State bodies in many of the arts areas. Their ability to provide translators would be limited and costly. I see merit in letting other nations know that we cherish the Irish language and that we want to promote it. We want to extend the use of the Irish language throughout the country and we want to strengthen our Gaeltacht areas. There is merit in trying to raise the status of the Irish language, both inside the EU and further afield.The Bill states that the Minister "shall promote the arts both inside the State and outside the State". That is a little strong for what could be practically and reasonably done by a Minister in terms of promoting the arts outside the State and communicating in the Irish language. I do not have any hard view on it. I see both the plus and the minus side. In the context of the Official Languages Bill, which we will discuss later, certain responsibilities and duties will be placed upon the Arts Council. It will have to provide an Irish language service, as will the Minister's Department. I am not sure the amendments proposed here are practical or that their strict implementation will help the Irish language in any significant way.

The reason the legislation is so broad in this context is to ensure that people who speak neither language will have their art forms recognised as well.We all acknowledge that it is possible for an art form to be expressed in French, Russian or Chinese in as much as it is possible for it to be expressed in English and Irish. Naturally, we try to encourage the Irish language. In that context there will be legislation discussed later in the House and there is other legislation dealing with that. We are trying to be all-embracing in terms of the art forms which will be recognised. It is desirable that we proceed on that basis as to do otherwise would be restrictive.

Glacaim go bhfuil deacrachtaí leis ach caithfear teacht thar na deacrachtaí sin má táimid sásta obair de réir an bhriathair. Is é an polasaí atá ag an Stát ná dátheangachas. Mar sin, níl na leasaithe seo ag teacht salach ar aon pholasaí atá ag an Rialtas nó a bhí ag aon Rialtas cheana.Other countries can manage to promote their arts in several languages. They do not have the difficulties mentioned or if they do they overcome them. In Brussels recently I visited the museum of comics which promotes an art form the Belgians have mastered. All the signage in the museum was in two languages, neither of which I could understand. However I could understand the art form. Because it is art I could interpret it. Nobody is asking that a sculpture be in Irish or English. However, if we are to produce material promoting a sculpture, a sculpture symposium or whatever, it should be promoted in both languages.There was a question in regard to a Minister who might not have expertise in Irish or the fluency this Minister has. We are not asking anybody to do the unthinkable. Press releases are issued in English at the moment. There is nothing stopping a Government press office or Minister from issuing the press release simultaneously in Irish.Every exhibition, concert etc. being promoted by the Government or the Minister can have its promotional material in Irish and English. This is not impossible. Anybody who visits Canada can see that. There they have English and French on every item. There is no problem doing it there or in Belgium. In many African countries the promotional literature is in three languages. If we are serious about making sure that everybody on this island, and those abroad interested in Irish arts, understand that we come from a rich culture grounded in the Irish language—

I understand the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will provide guidelines for the Departments. Is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism prepared to give an undertaking now that the issue which is the substance of these two amendments will be taken into consideration when he provides his scheme to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?

Also, a number of our crafts people are from Gaeltacht areas. There is a need, because of the enormous potential the arts and the Irish language have for the future development of the arts here, for an expression of that in this Bill. If the Minister is not prepared to accept these amendments, which as I explained previously do not alter the context or direction of the Bill, he is reneging on that commitment. I ask him to revisit this question. I am sure then that following advice from his officials he will come round to the view of Deputies on this side of the House.

While that is not covered by this legislation, I have an abiding interest in the language. The legislation provides for accommodation of art forms in whatever language. There are art forms for which no language is used. For example, no language is used in mime, and sign language is also used regularly. It is important that the legislation is all-embracing in so far as the expression of art is concerned. It would be wrong and self-defeating if I were to bring about a scenario that would restrict rather than expand the accommodation of art forms. This legislation is about expansion and accommodation, not restriction.

The amendment specifically states "shall promote the arts". Nobody is being asked to do the impossible. Where no language is involved, neither of the official languages can be promoted. We should not be dependent on schemes to be introduced under the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002, given that they might never see the light of day because they do not have to be implemented as soon as the legislation is passed.There is an opportunity under this legislation for the Minister to set an example for other Ministers to follow. This refers to a simple function of the Minister. Irish should have the same standing as English and it should be promoted on an equal basis. It would be a pity if the standard, which was not complied with by the Arts Council up to now, was not set down in the legislation. The Minister would set an example to the council if he were to accept the amendment.

In page 5, to delete lines 11 to 14 and substitute the following:"(3) In order to give effect to consultations under subsection (2) of this section, there shall be established a permanent inter-departmental review group comprising representatives of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Finance, as well as such other public bodies as the Minister may from time to time determine, whose functions shall be to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of arts policy generally, subject to detailed terms of reference to be provided by the Minister, and who shall publish an annual report setting out their findings in relation thereto.”.To strengthen the Bill and make it more effective, this provision is very important. After section 5(2)(b) of the Bill, it is very important to insert this provision. Section 5(2)(b) provides that the Minister may, in the performance of his or her functions under this section, consult such Ministers of the Government, public bodies or other persons as he or she considers appropriate.Officials in the different Departments may consult each other in a bilateral way and Ministers meet at Cabinet or may use other means of communication. However, the issue of consultation needs to be given far more permanency, which is the reason I tabled this amendment. I am suggesting that here should be established:A permanent inter-departmental review group comprising representatives of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Finance, as well as such other public bodies as the Minister may from time to time determine, whose functions shall be to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of arts policy generally, subject to detailed terms of reference to be provided by the Minister, and who shall publish an annual report setting out their findings in relation thereto.In addition to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism a number of Departments have a critical role to play in the promotion of the arts here. Submission 221 in the Dorgan report made by Ciarán Benson stated:Ireland is relatively advanced in the way that the arts are already integrated into the remit of so many Government Departments. To a greater or lesser degree there is perhaps a role here for the Department in convening a cross-department discussion group or some such body with a view to harmonising and expanding this provision.The PricewaterhouseCoopers report stated that unless there is such a body here, only if support were given at the highest level of Government would the type of change required actually happen. It also suggested a similar type of structure.I know we will have an opportunity to discuss the arts and education later. The Department of Education and Science has a very important role in the development of the arts here. A number of studies over the years have shown a significant lack of music education in our primary and post-primary schools. I will quote some statistics on that later.In this Bill the Minister is stressing the important role of local authorities. Given its responsibility in providing funding for local authorities, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has a considerable input into the development of the arts. The Department of Foreign Affairs has its own cultural relations committee. Will that continue to rest in the Department of Foreign Affairs if the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will be promoting the arts abroad? What will be the Minister's relationship with the cultural relations committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs? Will there be an overlap or if the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is promoting the arts abroad will that be through the cultural relations committee?The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has responsibility for broadcasting which is so important for the arts. The provision for the arts and our national broadcaster is essential for the arts. Individually and collectively the future of the arts rests in other Departments as well as the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Minister should consider this proposal seriously.There are other examples of this type of interdepartmental structure that can work quite effectively and I am now giving the Minister the opportunity to accept such a structure. It is quite apparent that Departments do not work closely together. There is very little contact between Departments. At times there is even lack of communications between Ministers, as evidenced in what has been happening in the last week, with one Minister not knowing what another is doing. If we have to depend on bilateral communication between Departments, we will not achieve the full potential for the development of the arts.

I do not believe adopting Deputy Deenihan's proposal would do anything for the arts in Ireland and would be unworkable in practice. The cultural relations committee, which was under the Department of Foreign Affairs, is now part of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	164	This Bill will give the Minister the power to set up a number of special committees. When doing so he should consider establishing one of those committees along the lines I propose here. I understand there will, for example, be a special committee on education. He should consider the interdepartmental approach.The Department of Finance has a very important role in the promotion of the arts in various ways, particularly through the Office of Public Works, and also as the provider of funding to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. If this type of structure were in place, the Department of the Environment and Local Government would have been much more sensitive towards the provision of funding for the arts in 2003 when it reduced the budget by 8% resulting in a large number of productions being put on ice with consequent loss of jobs and even leading to the closure of some centres around the country. If this type of structure were in place, the Department of Finance and officialdom would be far more sensitive to funding for the arts and there would be considerably more communication between all Departments and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.We must look at the arts in a broader way rather than just compartmentalising them and identifying only the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism with the arts. I am sure the Minister will agree there is an opportunity to capitalise on the vast potential for the promotion of the arts across the various Departments. I am convinced the structure I am proposing would work if property driven. It would be of considerable assistance to the Minister and of benefit in developing of the arts. The Minister strongly opposed this amendment on Committee Stage and clearly will not accept it now. However, when he considers the special committees, which we will discuss later, he should consider this kind of structure.

In page 5, lines 15 and 16, to delete "A direction under this section may include a requirement that the Council" and substitute "The Minister may direct the Council to".This relates to what I said earlier about one of the major changes in the Bill. The Minister has given himself far more power to get involved in the day-to-day running of the Arts Council. If one looks at our history of arts legislation, previous Ministers and Taoisigh stated clearly that they favoured the arm's length approach. They were concerned at all times that the Arts Council would be seen as an independent agency and a kind of buffer between politics and artists and arts organisations. The Bill will change that relationship and that is not a good departure.I said at the outset that it is important the Government is there to provide resources and finance but should not direct policy or decide who gets the money. I realise there is a provision in the Bill ensuring the Arts Council will still be free to decide who gets grants but the Minister has indicated to a number of organisations that he is prepared to direct it to ring-fence money for a particular organisation. He should expand on that rumour.The Arts Council, for all its flaws and deficiencies, has been quite successful over the years but the Bill provides for future Ministers being able to influence policy or take a hands-on approach to the activities of the Arts Council. This amendment and others are intended to ensure the independence of the Arts Council is maintained and that the arm's length approach is accepted and enshrined in legislation. We can then continue to develop the arts in Ireland in a non-political way. The Minister may say this is difficult but the Bill means there will be more political interference in the arts in the future than heretofore.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Since I entered the House no Bill has been the cause of more representations than this one. Obviously there is a need for transparency for all the directives from the Minister of the day to the Arts Council. Those must be documented. It is great to see such interest in the arts, as was seen in the number of representations we got and continue to get. Those people should be able to see the directives the Minister gives to the Arts Council. Such directives should come before the Oireachtas for discussion and then those interested in the arts can see them.Deputy Deenihan is right in suggesting that as it stands, the Bill will mean a greater degree of political interference than heretofore, which is regrettable. Given the amount of interest among people in developing the arts, traditional and contemporary, there should be no such political interference in the work of the Arts Council and the development of our arts. We are lucky to have those arts to develop and the Minister should consider my amendment in this regard.It is important the House has the opportunity to assess any such directives. Many parliamentary questions are returned unanswered to Deputies because the Minister in question has no responsibility to the House regarding the question. If we do not act on this matter we will add more frustration to the situation regarding parliamentary questions. We do not have a mechanism available to us to relay information to our constituents because Ministers state they have no responsibility to the House on certain topics or agencies. We must stop that and put a mechanism in place to ensure such directives are part of the business of the House and therefore subject to scrutiny by Members.I hope the Minister looks at this issue in that light – that it is a mechanism which allows Deputies to investigate ministerial directives to the Arts Council. We can then relay that information to the many interested sectors of the arts community. There should be no grey area here; a Minister should not be able to give directives to the Arts Council without a facility for the public to question those directives through their public representatives.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 relate to, and seek in various ways to limit, the proposal in the Bill that the Minister is empowered to direct the Arts Council to comply with polices of the Government. As I explained in some detail on Committee Stage, it is entirely reasonable that the relevant Minister or the Government is empowered to direct the Arts Council to comply with relevant policies. There is a fundamental principle here, which is that spending of public money should be accounted for to the people from whom this money is taken in taxation. This must happen through the democratic process.Despite some suggestions to the contrary, I do not accept that allowing the Government, which provides funding for arts, to make broad policies regarding the use of these funds in some way involves inappropriate influence on the arts. No one is suggesting that I, any other Minister or any other Government should be able to tell artists what they should produce, what the subject matter should be, what interpretation they should apply or that any political bias or view should advantage artists in terms of funding. There is nothing in the Bill which comes anywhere near any of these things and, indeed, by giving statutory status to the arm's length principle, we are copper-fastening the independence of the council in individual funding decisions. Based on the above, I cannot accept these amendments.Amendments Nos. 14 and 18 appear to be an attempt to improve the legal construction of the Bill. However, the existing construction is based on the advice of the parliamentary counsel and I cannot see any clear basis for disputing his judgment. I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.It is the case that the Minister will be in a position to ensure Government policy is implemented. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If Ben Hur arrived in here on a chariot with Shakespeare at his side and asked me to change this provision, I would not do so. If politicians do not trust themselves, they cannot expect the public to trust them. In that respect, it is surely the function of a Government in any democracy to ensure that its policies are carried out.For many years – let me be quite plain about it – there has been no coherent policy on the traditional arts and they have been inadequately funded. It is of immense importance that there is a coherent strategy for the traditional arts and that this strategy is financed. It is incumbent on the Minister for arts of the day to ensure that sound Government policies are implemented. I make no apology to anyone for that.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	169	We all agree the traditional arts have been neglected. Of the total funding for the Arts Council, they got 1% in 2002. We need a policy for the traditional arts in the future but I do not see this Bill providing that opportunity. There is a contradiction in what the Minister said. On the one hand, he said the Government will assume an arm's length approach in regard to the provision of grants while, on the other hand, he, more or less, implied that he will direct the Arts Council to provide funding for the traditional arts. At this stage, he should declare that the arm's length approach in regard to the provision of grants by the Arts Council is gone.I am totally in favour of providing funding for the traditional arts, whether through the Arts Council or the Department. Most of my work is concerned with the promotion of the traditional arts. It is important the traditional arts are promoted and that organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann are given more financial support from Government sources. It is a national movement and should be supported and funded.I am not discussing the question of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann or any other group, but the principle of State support and control. On Second Stage I mentioned how regimes in the last century manipulated the arts to further their own ideals. I am not saying it would happen in this country but it could. That is the reason the demarcation line should be kept. If the Arts Council is not working, we should improve it but that demarcation line between politics and the arts and decisions which affect individual artists should be kept. It has been emphasised since 1951. As I already mentioned, in history of the arts and in legislation on the arts, it has been emphasised again and again. It is important to keep that demarcation line.This section provides the Minister of the day with too much power for interference in the arts and I think it will lead to a lot of conflict in the future. I am convinced there will be problems because of the additional rather extraordinary powers which this section will give to the Minister. It has nothing to do with funding for the traditional arts. A basic principle, enshrined in previous legislation, is being changed by this Bill.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I find it difficult to understand the rigid position the Minister has taken in this regard. The amendment I tabled would publicise the directive which the Minister will give to the Arts Council, what the Minister is proposing and the way it will help to improve the arts. I find it difficult to understand why he will not provide a mechanism which would allow Members of the House to discuss the directive he will give to the Arts Council. That is the worrying aspect of it. When this legislation is enacted and the Minister of the day gives a directive to the Arts Council, there is no mechanism which would allow this House to discuss it. This seems to be a trend. Members who table parliamentary questions will know of the numbers referred back to them stating that the Minister has no responsibility for the matter. This is one of the most important Bills which will pass through the House, judging by the number of representations we have received, yet we are closing off an opportunity for this House to discuss the directives of the Minister. That is a worrying trend. We are ensuring that this House will not discuss something which has generated considerable interest in the past year and a half since this Bill was brought forward.I am concerned that the Minister will not bring forward some mechanism which would allow ministerial directives to be debated in the House. This is the House of Parliament in which we represent the people of our constituencies, although in this case we are representing a much broader constituency given the number of representations we have received. I am concerned that nothing has been done to put a mechanism in place to allow Members to discuss directives. We are closing off an opportunity for debate in this House on one of the most important legislative items which has arisen in my brief.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Traditional arts represent one of our great natural resources. Irish traditional music is a trade name world-wide and very few countries have their native music as a trade name or have had such an ambassador as Irish music has been for the island of Ireland.The Arts Council's allocation of 1% of its budget towards the traditional arts is a disgrace. All 166 Members should send out a loud and clear message to the Arts Council that is to represent us for the next 12 months that what has happened in the past cannot be allowed to continue in the future.There was a reference to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, to which I feel very close. It was set up in my home town of Mullingar in 1951. Having been a musician before becoming a Member of the Oireachtas, I note that the lack of funding and support by all Governments for Irish art in recent years has been nothing short of a disgrace. The amount of goodwill generated abroad by the playing of Irish music, be it that of the Chieftains or U2, is remarkable. No one has done more for the image of Ireland world-wide than traditional Irish artists.This Bill is coming to the House at the beginning of the term of a new Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has asked for support in respect of various parts and sections of it. I am prepared to give my full support to him because he understands the arts, perhaps because of where he comes from. His heart is in the right place. We can return to the House in the next year or year and a half to assess the pros and cons of the Arts Council's dealings with traditional arts in the next year.

However, they got no support and it is about time we did what we should do and what we have to do. I ask all Members to afford the Minister the opportunity to prove his bona fides that Government policy will be the policy we will all want for the future.Consider what "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance" have done for the image of the young, new Ireland and for the perception of our culture and music. Nothing else could have surpassed the good they have done for the image of our country.I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House. This year, we are giving our total support to the Arts Council but we are watching vigilantly to see how it will treat traditional arts. It has a major problem in that it is perceived to be elitist. I know the Minister would not want to be associated with that, nor would the Government in the future. The council has a problem to address and we will study its progress. If we had the support of the Arts Council, imagine what an allocation of 10% or 15% of its budget would do to assist traditional arts, given that we have seen what 1% can do.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Those of us who come from counties where the traditional arts flourish agree that traditional arts are not getting fair support. I blame the Government as much as the Arts Council. The Arts Council gets a certain sum of money and it is being torn and dragged by all sections for this funding. That it has allocated so little to the traditional arts in the past is an indictment of Governments and probably the members of the Arts Council as well. The board of the Arts Council obviously has to approve the grants allocated by the council.If past Governments had been concerned about the traditional arts, they would have intervened. They should have provided funding independently of the Arts Council. Between 1983 and 1987, the then Government, under Garret FitzGerald, gave £300,000 to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann out of some sailors' fund when it was in deep trouble. There have been no similar gestures made since in respect of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the traditional arts.It is not a question of funding a particular organisation or organisations but a question of the diminution of the arm's-length relationship, established over the years and accepted by everyone in the past, that exists between the Government of the day and the Arts Council. If this relationship was accepted, there was obviously some reason for doing so. An autocratic system might develop where the Arts Council would be dictated to in respect of all its decisions, maybe not under Deputy O'Donoghue but under another Minister. That is my fear and if the Minister can assure me to the contrary I will accept it. This is the main issue because the issue of standing committees is no longer relevant because the Minister has removed references to them in the Bill, and membership will be increased. We should address the kernel of the Bill.

The whole question of funding will, as I have painstakingly pointed out in the past, be a reserved function of the Arts Council but the Government is entitled, whichever Government it is, to have its policies implemented and there is nothing whatsoever wrong with having a provision such as this in the legislation to ensure that happens. I am not going to abdicate my responsibilities and no other Minister could be expected to or should do so. It is quite straightforward.If Government policy is not being implemented, or if policies should be implemented which are not being implemented, it will be the duty or the function of the Minister of the day, and the Government, to write to the Arts Council and insist that the Government's policies are implemented. That is as fair and as straight as I can make it. There is nothing wrong with that, there is no inappropriate interference and there is no secret about it because everything will be on the table. I cannot for the life of me see why any democrat could disagree with that. If people do not like the policies or if they do not like what the Government suggests then they can vote the Government out of power.

Is é priomhchuspóir an Bhille ná soláthar níos mó agus ar chaighdeán níos áirde de sheirbhisí i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil.Ina theannta sin, sonraítear roinnt forálacha ginearálta bunúsacha sa mBille a mbeidh feidhm coitianta leo, mar shampla comhfhreagras i dteanga oifigiúil a fhreagairt sa teanga oifigiúil chéanna, foilseacháin dhátheangacha de dhoiciméid thábhachtacha áirithe, usaid na Gaeilge sna cúirteanna, comharthaíocht, fógraíocht agus ar uile.Beidh dualgas reachtúil á chur freisin ar Ranna Stáit agus ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a leithéid de sheirbhisí a sholáthar ar bhealach comhtháite trí chreat pleanála reachtúil, ar a dtugtar scéim, a bheidh le hathnuachan gach trí bliana le haontú an Aire agus ceann an chomhlachta phoiblí i gceist.Is iad na príomhcheisteanna a bhí romham agus mé ag cur an Bhille seo in eagar ná aitheantas cuí a thabhairt do sheasamh bunreachtúil na Gaeilge mar an príomhtheanga oifigiúil gan aon ghearradh trasna a dhéanamh ná aon bhréagnu a dhéanamh ar an seasamh bunreachtúil sin agus, ag an am céanna, feabhsaithe praiticiúla ar staid lag na Gaeilge sa saol poiblí a bhaint amach, go hairithe ó thaobh seirbhisí poibli tri Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil.Ainneoin phríomhaíocht bhunreachtúil na Gaeilge mar an príomhtheanga oifigiúil tá, mar is eol do Theachtai, staid na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha sa lá atá inniu ann ina fíorbhagairt dá todhchaí, fiú amháin sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Taobh amuigh den Bhunreacht, níl aon reachtaíocht ann chun a chinntiú go gcuirfear seirbhisí ar fáil tré Ghaeilge. Tá mé ag moladh an Bhille seo chun an fhaillí sin a leigheas. Mar thoradh ar an easpa reachtaíochta sin, bhí sé deacair a chur ina luí ar chomhlachtaí Stáit go bhfuil cearta ag saoránaigh na hÉireann i dtaca le soláthar seirbhisí i nGaeilge. Seachas cothrom na féinne a chur ar fáil do chainteoirí Gaeilge, más ón nGaeltacht nó lasmuigh di dóibh, tá meon ann go forleathan gur leor seirbhisí a chur ar fail i mBéarla amháin. Mar shampla, níl aon amhras ach nár tugadh morán aird ar na treoirlínte a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge, mar a bhí ag an am sin i 1993, maidir le seirbhisí Stáit a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge. Tá glactha leis go forleathan anois, measaim, go bhfuil gá le hathrú ó threoirlínte neamhreachtúla go dtí córas foirmiúil reachtúil agus nach mbeidh an t-aitheantas ceart ag an Ghaeilge go dtí go mbeidh aitheantas cuí aici sa Státchoras agus sa saol poiblí. Is mar gheall ar sin gur chinn an Rialtas go raibh gá le reachtaíocht agus go bhfuil Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2002 a chur faoi bhráid na Dála inniu. Beidh deis ag Teachtaí ar ball a gcuid tuairimí faoin mBille a chur in iúl agus tá mé ag tnúth go mór le cloisteáil uathu.Faoin mBille, beidh ar chomhlacht poiblí dréacht-scéim a ullmhú, lena sonrófar na céimeanna ar leith a thógfaidh sé chun a chinntiú gur féidir le saoránaigh a dteastaíonn uathu a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh i gceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla é sin a dhéanamh. Beidh gá an scéim sin a chur in oiriúint do chuinsí eagsúla gach eagrais maidir lena chuid seirbhisí a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge, ag cur leis an rud atá indéanta go praiticiúil go gearrthéarmach chun moiminteam a ghiniúint i dtreo forbartha eile in am trátha. Go bunúsach, séard atáthar ag súil leis ná módh pleanáilte agus straitéiseach chun plean a chur i bhfeidhm ar bhonn céimiúil a thabharfaidh aitheantas ar thaobh amháin d'acmhainní eagrais maidir le scileanna sa Ghaeilge agus, ar an taobh eile, do riachtanais daoine a dteastaíonn uathu an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus iad ag plé leis an eagras sin. Sa gcomhthéacs sin, ba chóir dom a lua gur cheadaigh an Rialtas, i mí Iúil 2000, go nglacfaí le comhionannas na dteangacha oifigiúla mar cheann de thrí phrionsabal maidir le seirbhís chustaiméara fheabhsaithe don tseirbhis phoiblí i gcoitinneLuaigh mé le linn na díospóireachta ar Chéim an Choiste sa Seanad go raibh athbhreithniú déanta agam ón uair a foilsíodh an Bille – i dtaca ach go hairithe le tuilleadh comhairle ón Árd-Aighne – ar roinnt buncheisteanna a bhaineann le stádas dlíthiúil agus bunreachtúil na Gaeilge. Mar a luas sa Seanad freisin, ardaíodh na ceisteanna sin chomh maith in aighneachtaí faoin mBille, ar a n-áiritear aighneachtaí ó Fhoras na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus eagrais eile dá leithéid, maraon le roinnt daoine aonair.Bhain ceann acu le húsáid an fhocail "comhionannas" sa Teideal Fada, sa Ghearrtheideal agus in alt 1 den Bhille i dtaca leis an nGaeilge, ag feachaint d'Airteagal 8 den Bhunreacht. Is í an cheist a bhí anseo ná go raibh se míchuí go labhróidh aon reachtaíocht i dtaobh comhionannais a bhronnadh ar an nGaeilge, ag cuimhneamh gar stádas tosaíochta atá ag an teanga faoi Airteagal 8.1 den Bhunreacht lena bhforáiltear, "Ós í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta is í an phríomhtheanga oifigiúil í."  Mé féin a lua an focal "comhionannas" an chéad uair mar gur shíl mé go mbéarfadh sé ar intinn an phobail agus go raibh tuiscint sa lá atá inniu ann ar an tábhachta a bhaineann le comhionannas. Ach, ar ndóigh, glacaim go hiomlán leis an leasú atá déanta agam féin, gurb í an Ghaeilge an príomhtheanga oifigiúil, agus níor mhaith liom baint de sin.Bhain ceist eile le forálacha ailt 8 agus 9 den Bhille mar a foilsíodh é – ó thaobh ceart an duine teagmháil le comhlacht poibli agus seirbhisí a fháil uaidh in aon cheann de na teangacha oifigiúla a bheith á theorannú d'aon scéim a bheidh ar bun i dtaca leis an gcomhlacht sin – ag féachaint do bhreithiúnas Hardiman i gcás Uí Bheoláin. Bunaithe ar an mbreithiúnas sin, bhí comhairle tugtha dom go bhfuil dualgas ar an Stát urramú do cheart bunreachtúil an tsaoránaigh gach gnó a dhéanamh leis an Stát i nGaeilge, in éagmais aon dlí a fhágann amach go baileach an ceart sin. Comhairlíodh dom, chomh maith, go bhfuil sé de réir fhorálacha an Bhunreachta, á shonrú de réir Airteagail 8.3, go gcuirfear seirbhisi áirithe ar fáil i mBéarla amháin leis an tuiscint go mbeidh, in am trátha, na seirbhisí sin ar fáil i nGaeilge.Ba sa gcomhthéacs sin a rinneadh na leasuithe seo a leanas ar an mBille sa Seanad: scriosadh an focal "comhionannas" as an Teideal Fada, as an nGearrtheideal agus as alt 1 den Bhille, maraon le leasuithe iarmhartacha eile; scriosadh an téacs d'ailt 8 agus 9 den Bhille (mar a bhí); agus rinneadh alt 13 den Bhille a leasu chun foráil a dhéanamh d'ullmhú dréacht scéime ina sonraítear faoi alt 9 den Bhille anois:(a) na seirbhisi a bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an gcomhlacht poiblí iad a sholáthar(i) trí mheán na Gaeilge amháin,(ii) trí mheán an Bhéarla amháin, agus(iii) trí mheán na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla araon;(b) na modhanna cumarsáide ata le cur ar fáil sa Ghaeilge amháin, sa Bhéarla amhain agus sa Ghaeilge agus sa Bhéarla araon, agus;(c) ceangal a bheith ar chomhlachtaí poiblí pleanáil a dhéanamh d'fheabhsuithe thar thréimhse, arna n-aontu le hAire na huaire maidir leis an leibhéal seirbhíse a chuirfear ar fáil sa Ghaeilge.Ní miste dom a lua go ndearnadh leasuithe eile – ba leasuithe teicniúla cuid acu – ar an mBille sa tSeanad chomh maith, ina measc: go mbeidh dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí, comhfhreagras – i scríbhinn nó leis an bpost leictreonach – i dteanga oifigiúil a fhreagairt sa teanga oifigiúil chéanna; agus go mbeidh dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí cinntiú go n-usáidtear Gaeilge, nó Béarla agus Gaeilge (níl úsáid Bhéarla amháin i gceist) ar stáiseanóireacht, ar chomharthaí agus ar fhógráin, faoi reir rialacháin a dhéanfaidh an tAire.Tá i gceist go ndéanfar laghdú, de reir a chéile, ar an réimse seirbhisí a gcuirtear ar fáil i mBéarla amháin, trí fheidhmiú na meicníochtaí monatóireachta agus maoirseoireachta atá á moladh agam. Sna cásanna nach gcuirtear a leithéid d'fheabhsuithe céimnithe ar fáil mar a cheanglaítear sa scéim reachtúil, beidh cumhacht ag an Aire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, a iarraidh ar chomhlachtaí poiblí plean a leagadh amach le haghaidh feabhsú ar an seirbhís Ghaeilge mar aon le hamscálaí faoi leith.Ba mhaith liom anois léargas a thabhairt ar na príomhfhorálacha sa Bhille ina n-ord de réir riar na n-alt. Mar is iondúil i reachtaíocht, 'se alt 1 a leagann amach Gearrtheideal agus tosach feidhme an Bhille. Leagtar amach anseo freisin go meastar go mbeidh an tAcht i bhfeidhm go hiomlán tráth nach déanaí ná trí bliana tar éis é a rith.‘Se alt 2 an fhoráil mhíniúcháin. Tá míniú le fáil ann ar "na Teangacha Oifigiúla" maraon le sainmhínithe ar théarmaí eile a úsáidtear sa Bhille.Déanann alt 3 foráil go n-íocfar aon chaiteachais a bhaineann le riaradh an Achta as airgead a chuirfidh an tOireachtas ar fáil, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais.Tugann alt 4 an chumhacht don Aire, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, rialacháin a dhéanamh i ndáil le forálacha an Achta. Leagtar amach ann go bhféadfaidh ceachtar Teach den Oireachtas rialacháin a dhéanfar faoin Acht a neamhnú laistigh de 21 lá suí ach, i gcúinsí áirithe, beidh gá le rún ó Thithe an Oireachtais chun dul ar aghaidh.Leagann alt 5 dualgas ar an Aire tuarascáil bhliantúil a thabhairt do Thithe an Oireachtas maidir le hoibriú an Achta an bhliain roimhe sin.Baineann alt 6 le cearta Comhaltaí an Oireachtais ceachtar de na teangacha oifigiúla a úsáid i dTithe an Oireachtais.Baineann alt 7 le foilsiú Achtanna go comhuaineach sa dá theanga oifigiúil.Baineann alt 8 le cearta an duine a rogha teanga oifigiúil a úsáid in imeachtaí dlíthiúla. Leagtar amach ann freisin go bhfuil an ceart ag duine éisteacht a fháil sa teanga oifigiúil is rogha leis nó léi.Mar atá luaite againn roimhe seo, leagann alt 9 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí dréacht-scéim reachtúil a ullmhú ina sonrófar na seirbhísí a bheartaíonn an comhlacht poiblí a sholáthar trí mheán na Gaeilge amháin, trí mheán an Bhéarla amháin, agus trí mheán na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla araon; agus na bearta a bheartaíonn an comhlacht a ghlacadh chun a chinntiú go ndéanfar aon seirbhísí eile nach soláthraíonn an comhlacht trí mheán na Gaeilge a sholáthar amhlaidh.Forálann alt 10 go bhfuil dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú go n-úsáidtear na teangacha oifigiúla ar stáiseanóireacht, ar chomharthaí agus ar fhógraí faoi réir le rialacháin a dhéanfaidh an tAire. Leagtar amach ann freisin go bhfuil dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí comhfhreagras – i scribhínn nó leis an bpost leictreonach – i dteanga oifigiúil a fhreagairt sa teanga oifigiúil chéanna.Leagann alt 11 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí, ar chomhlachtaí Stáit iad freisin, doiciméid áirithe ar díol spéise iad don phobal, mar shampla, tograí polasaithe, tuarascálacha bliantúla agus ráitis straitéise, a fhoilsiú go comhuaineach sa dá theanga oifigiúil.Baineann alt 12 le cead a thabhairt don Aire treoirlínte chun cuidiú le comhlachtaí poiblí scéim a ullmhú agus a éisiúint. Leagtar amach ann na nósanna imeachta chun na treoirlínte sin a réiteach, lena n-áirítear próiseas comhchomhairle. Déanfar cóip de na treoirlínte ceadaithe a leagan faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas. Is féidir na treoirlínte a leasú ó am go ham.Leagann alt 13 dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí dréacht-scéim reachtúil a ullmhú. Is é tús an phróisis ná iarratas oifigiúil ón Aire chuig comhlacht poiblí ag iarraidh air dréacht-scéim a ullmhú agus a chur faoi bhráid an Aire laistigh de thréimhse shonrach ama nach deanaí ná sé mhí ó dháta an iarratais. Leagtar amach freisin go gcinnteofar leis an ndréacht-scéim go bhfuil líon leordhóthanach den fhoireann inniúil sa Ghaeilge agus cinnteofar freisin go bhfreastalófar ar na riachtanais áirithe Gaeilge a bhaineann le seirbhísí a sholáthar sa Ghaeltacht.Baineann alt 14 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint ag an Aire roimh dhréacht-scéim a dheimhniú. Tar éis an dréacht-scéim a dheimhniú leis an gcomhlacht poiblí lena mbaineann, cuirfidh an tAire cóip den scéim ar aghaidh chuig Coimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Fanfaidh scéim i bhfeidhm ar feadh tréimhse trí bliana de ghnáth agus ina dhiaidh sin caithfear iad a athnuachan. Tá i gceist go n-úsáidfear an meicníocht athnuachana seo chun feabhas suntasach céimiúil a bhaint amach, thar tréimhse, ar leibhéal na seirbhíse trí Ghaeilge a chuirtear ar fáil.Tugann altanna 15, 16 agus 17 cumhacht don Aire athbhreithniú tréimhsiúil ar scéimeanna a iarraidh; scéim a leasú i gcás go dtiocfaidh aon athrú ar fheidhmeanna nó ar chúinsí comhlachta phoiblí agus aon teip, diúltú nó neamhábaltacht maidir le scéim a ullmhú, a thuairisciú do Thithe an Oireachtais.Leagann alt 18 dualgas ar chomhlacht poiblí scéim a bheidh ceadaithe faoin Acht a chur i bhfeidhm. Forálann sé leis nach mbeidh raon na scéime ina theorainn ar an gcomhlacht poiblí ó thaobh na mbeart a ghlacann sé chun stadas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn laistigh den eagraíocht.Forálann alt 19 nach féidir le comhlacht poiblí aon chostas a ghearradh ar dhuine de thoradh aon dhualgas a thitfidh ar an gcomhlacht poiblí sin faoin Acht.Baineann alt 20 le bunús Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Beidh an Coimisinéir neamhspleách i gcomhlíonadh a fheidhmeanna nó a feidhmeanna agus ceapfaidh an tUachtarán é nó í.Baineann altanna 21 agus 22 le feidhmeanna agus cumhachtaí an choimisinéara. Chomp maith le monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chomhlíonadh an Achta ag comhlachtaí poiblí, beidh de chead ag an gcoimisinéir fiosrúcháin a dhéanamh agus comhairle nó cúnamh a chur ar fáil do chomhlachtaí poiblí agus don phobal. Leagann alt 22 síos, mar shampla, go bhfuil de chumhacht ag an gCoimisinéar dualgas a chur ar dhuine faisnéis nó taifid a sholáthar agus leagtar amach ann an pionós a chuirfear ar dhuine nach ndéanann amhlaidh.Baineann alt 23 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint nuair a bheidh fiosrúcháin a dhéanamh ag an gcoimisinéir.Leagtar síos in alt 24 nach féidir leis an gcoimisinéir gearán is ábhar d'imeachtaí dlíthiúla sibhialta a fhiosrú, mura rud é gur cuí déanamh amhlaidh de bharr cúinse speisialta.Leagtar síos in alt 25 nach féidir faisnéis a gheobhaidh an coimisinéir i mbun a c(h)uid d(h)ualgas a úsáid ach amháin chun na críche sin.Baineann alt 26 leis na nósanna imeachta a bheidh le leanúint i ndáil le tuarascálacha ar thoradh fiosrúcháin ag an gcoimisinéir. Beidh de chead ag an gcoimisinéir moltaí a dhéanamh i dtuarascálacha den tsórt sin agus, mura gcuirfidh an comhlacht poiblí na moltaí sin i bhfeidhm, féadfaidh an coimisinéir tuarascáil maidir leis sin a thabhairt do Thithe an Oireachtais.Tugann alt 27 an chumhacht don Aire amach anseo, le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, scéim cúitimh a thabhairt isteach sa chás go dteipeann ar chomhlacht poiblí forálacha an Achta a chomhlíonadh.Leagtar sios in alt 28 gur féidir achomhairc a dhéanamh chuig an Ard-Chúirt, ar phointe dlí, i gcoinne cinntí de chuid an choimisinéara.Tugann alt 29 an chumhacht don choimisinéir tráchtaireachtaí ar fheidhm phraiticiúil agus ar oibriú an Achta a ullmhú, d'fhonn cuidiú le comhlachtaí poiblí agus leis an bpobal.Leagann alt 30 dualgas ar an gcoimisinéir tuarascáil bhliantúil a ullmhú maidir le ghníomhaíochtaí na hoifige i rith na bliana agus ní mór dó no di an tuarascáil sin a chur faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais. Féadfaidh an coimisinéir freisin, mas cuí leis nó léi déanamh amhlaidh ar mhaithe le leas an phobail, tuarascáil a fhoilsiú i ndáil le haon fhiosrúchán a bheidh déanta aige no aici nó i ndáil le haon fheidhm eile a bheidh comhlíonta aige nó aici faoin Acht.Forálann alt 31 nach ndéanann forálacha an Achta aon difear do chumhachtaí an Ombudsman.Forálann alt 32 nach dtabharfaidh an tAcht aon cheart do dhuine cás dlí a thógáil in aghaidh comhlacht poiblí dá dteipfeadh air a dhualgas maidir le scéim reachtúil a chomhíonadh faoin Acht. Forálann sé freisin nach mbeidh aon chás dlí ann, in aon chúirt, i gcoinne an choimisinéara nó bhaill dá fhoirne i leith aon ghnó a bheidh déanta acu de mheon macánta.Sa Chéad Sceideal, leagtar amach na comhlachtaí a bheidh ina gcomhlachtaí poiblí chun críocha an Achta. Leagtar amach ann freisin an nós imeachta i gcás ina mbeifear ag iarraidh scóip an Achta a leathnú amach anseo chuig earnálacha den gheilleagar, seachas an earnáil phoiblí, atá ag soláthar seirbhísí go díreach don phobal, mar shampla, bainc thráchtála, gníomhaireachtaí eile a thugann iasachtaí, cuideachtaí árachais, cuideachtaí iompair, soláthraithe cúraim sláinte agus cuideachtaí teileachumarsáide. D'fhéadfadh sé go leathnófar an scóip chuig cuideachtaí a chuireann seirbhísí atá comhchosúil leis na seirbhísí a chuireann comhlachtaí poiblí ar fáil nó chuig comhlacht a bhí, tráth theacht i bhfeidhm an Achta seo, ina chomhlacht poiblí ach a rinneadh príobhodú air ina dhiaidh. D'fhéadfadh sé go leathnófar í freisin chuig comhlachtaí a fhaigheann airgead go díreach ó Aire den Rialtas nó ó Roinn nó go díreach on bPríomh-Chiste más rud é nach lú ná 50% de chaiteachas reatha comhlachta i mbliain áirithe an méid a fhaightear.Sa Dara Sceideal, leagtar amach forálacha a bhaineann le hoifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla.Ba mhaith liom anois cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an tagairt don Ghaeltacht sa Bhille seo. I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom aird na dTeachtaí a dhíriú arís ar na forálacha sa Bhille a mbeidh tionchar díreach, dearfach agus suntasach acu do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go speisialta, ar leibhéal agus ar chaighdeán na seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a bheidh de dhualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a sholáthar do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. I measc na bhforálacha sin áirím ach go háirithe an ceart atá ag duine in imeachtaí dlíthiúla éisteacht a fháil agus a rogha teanga oifigiúil a úsáid (alt 8); an dualgas atá ar chomhlachtaí poiblí dréacht-scéim reachtúil a ullmhú ina sonrófar na seirbhísí a bheartaíonn an comhlacht a sholáthar trí mheán na Gaeilge amháin (alt 9); an dualgas atá ar chomhlachtaí poiblí, comhfhreagras – i scribhínn nó leis an bpost leictreonach – i dteanga oifigiúil a fhreagairt sa teanga oifigiúil chéanna (alt 10); an dualgas atá ar chomhlachtaí go gcinnteofar leis an ndréacht-scéim go bhfuil líon leordhóthanach den fhoireann inniúil sa Ghaeilge agus go gcinnteofar freisin go bhfreastalófar ar na riachtanais áirithe Ghaeilge a bhaineann le seirbhísí a sholáthar sa Ghaeltacht. (alt 13).Táim sásta go bhfuil na forálacha sin cuimsitheach agus go gcuirfeadh said go mór le leibhéal agus le caighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge a chuirfear ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Táim sásta freisin go gcinnteoidh an Bille seo, thar an tréimhse tosaigh, soláthar seirbhísí poiblí sa Ghaeilge atá i bhfad níos fearr ó thaobh caighdeáin de agus níos fairsinge ó thaobh réimse de, i gcomparáid leis an scéal fíorasach atá ann i láthair na huaire agus go soláthróidh sé meicníocht a bheidh láidir go leor chun ligean domsa, mar Aire, agus do mo chomharbaí, an leibhéal tosaigh sin a fheabhsú de réir a chéile chun soláthar seirbhísí níos mó, céim ar chéim, a chinntiú, chun freastal ar éilimh na ndaoine a úsaideann an Ghaeilge mar rogha theanga go minic nó ar bhonn laethúil.Táimse lánmhuiníneach chomh maith go bhféadfai, le fíorchomhoibriú ón tseirbhís phoiblí, bunaithe ar na fíor-acmhainní atá ar fáil agus is féidir a bheith ar fail, meadú faoi cheathair a dhéanamh ar an bhfíorleibhéal seirbhísí nGaeilge sa chéad tréimhse pleanála de réir na reachtaíochta nua. Agus tá mé ag dul níos faide fós leis an mBille seo. Teastaíonn uaim suíomh a chruthú a mbeidh sochaí ann a bheidh fíor-dhátheangach, nach mbeidh ar chainteoirí Gaeilge machnamh an dara huair sula ndéanann siad seirbhísí poiblí a lorg agus a úsáid sa teanga is fearr leo. Mar a dúirt mé, cruthaíonn an Bille seo na cuinsí inar féidir linn togáil – ar bhealach pleanáilte, réadúil, seasta – ar an méid is feidir linn a bhaint amach go réadúil anois, agus gluaiseacht ar aghaidh ar bhealach céimnithe, le muinín iomlán go n-eireoidh leis an gcuspóir atá curtha in iúl agam.Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don obair atá deanta ag na heagrais Ghaeilge agus ag daoine éagsúla a chuir a gcuid dtuairimí ós ár gcomhair maidir le forálacha an Bhille mar a foilsíodh é. Rinneadh scrúdú orthu sin ar fad, agus mar is eol don Teach, tá cuid mhaith de na moltaí san áireamh anois sa Bhille atá os ár gcomhair inniu.Mar atá ráite agam go minic roimhe seo, creidim go laidir gurb é an Bille seo ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí don Ghaeilge le fada an lá. Sa gcomhthéacs sin beidh baint lárnach ag an mBille, ach é a bheith achtaithe – rud a bainfear amach, le cúnamh Dé, roimh dheireadh an tseisiún Dála seo – le ceann de phríomhstraitéisí na Roinne don treimhse trí bliana amach romhainn a chur i bhfeidhm. Is é sin, úsáid na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre a mhéadú agus tacú le cothabháil na Gaeilge i gceantair Ghaeltachta trí sholathar níos fearr seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge a chinntiú.Thuig mise go maith go raibh dúshlán mór romham nuair a thug mé faoin obair seo. Bhí a fhios agam gur cuma céard a dhéanfainn nach mbeadh daoine sásta leis. An chaoi a chonaic mise é ná seo, go bhfuil 66 bliain imithe ó cuireadh an Bunreacht i bhfeidhm. I gcaitheamh an ama sin, tar éis go raibh soláthar soiléir san mBunreacht dá leithéid den Acht teanga seo agus go bhfuil féidireacht reachtaíocht luaite go sonrúil san mBunreacht níor tugadh isteach aon Bille teanga ariamh. Is cuma cén chaint a déantar ní féidir le haon reachtaíocht cearta bunreachta a bhaint de dhuine ar bith. Is bun riail dlí é sin.Tá a fhios agam cén staid ar mhaith liom a bheith sa tír. Ba bhreá liom go mbeimís ar nós an Iorruaidh, an tSúilinn ná an Danmhairge agus go mbeadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar chéad teanga ag an bpobal i gcoitinne agus go mbeadh an Béarla ag gach uile dhuine freisin, mar is teanga mór domhanda é. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh níos mó ná 5% den phobal ag labhairt na Gaeilge gach uile lá, go bhféadfaimís gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge go laethúil anseo agus go mbeadh éileamh mór ar sheirbhísí trí mheán na Gaeilge sna háiteanna a bhfuiltear curtha ar fáil. Is iomaí rud ar mhaith liom ach ní leor é sin le rud a chur i gcrích. Níl ach 5% den tseirbhís poiblí, mas aon mhacasamhail den phobal iad, inniúil ar sheirbhísú a chur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ní fhéadfainn an staid a athrú thart trí reachtaíocht. An rud ba mheasa a bhféadfadh éinne a dhéanamh ná reachtaíocht a thabhairt isteach nach mbeadh infheidhmithe go praiticiúl agus bheadh chomh hilmhianach is go ndéanfaí neamhaird air agus go mbeadh an oiread sin daoine ag déanamh neamhairde air is nach bhféadfadh tada a dhéanamh faoi. Chonaic muid samplaí maithe cheana de reachtaíocht nach féidir a fheidhmiú.Is é an slat tomhais a bhí agam agus mé ag réiteach an Bhille ná go scríobhfainn sa reachtaíocht an oiread agus ab'fhéidir a bhaint amach go praticiúil i láthair na huaire. Creidim go mbeidh tionchar an-dearfach ag an mBille seo ar fíor úsáid na Gaeilge go laethúil, ach é a bheith achtaithe.Is deas an rud é plé a bheith ann ach tá sé tábhachtach go mairfeadh daoine sa bhfíor shaol mar atá sé i láthair na huaire. Glacaim leis, ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, nach saol ídéalach é. Feicim gach uile lá i mo dháilcheantar féin nach féidir bun sheirbhísí den chineál is simplí a fháil trí mheán na Gaeilge agus beifear ag cinntiú, nuair a chuirtear na pleananna i bhfeidhm, nach amhlaidh a bhéas.Ó d'fhág mé an ollscoil chaith mé mo shaol ar fad ag obair do eagraíochtaí a raibh baint acu leis an nGaeilge ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile. Bhí mé ag obair i gConradh na Gaeilge tráth agus d'oibrigh mé i gComhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge ina dhiaidh sin. Ansin thóg mé céim mhór agus chuaigh mé siar chun cónaí san nGaeltacht ag obair i gcomharchumann Gaeltachta go raibh sé mar phríomh aidhm aige cúrsaí Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sa cheantar Gaeltachta sin. Tá clann tógtha agam le Gaeilge. Níl rud ar bith, go réalaíoch, nach ndéanfainn ar son na Gaeilge ach cé acu ab fhearr, rud praiticiúil a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus é a chur i gcrích agus toradh a bheith air nó scríoh dlí a bheadh chomh hilmhianach is nach dtabharfaí aird air mar nar tugadh ar go leor beartais i leith na Gaeilge thar na blianta.The media often does not bother reporting what people say in Irish in this House, which is a tragedy and a pity. It does not avail of the translation system which is available. It is, therefore, difficult to speak to the English speaking population through the medium of Irish in the House because of the unwillingness of people to do what they would do in any other place in the world, namely, use translation systems.This Bill is for all the people and for those who believe, whether they have or speak Irish, that the Irish language is part of their heritage and life. As well as providing services for those who use Irish on a daily basis, the other aim of the Bill is that Irish, which is enshrined in the Constitution as the first official language, would be more visible as a language in this country. That is the wish of the majority of non-Irish speakers. Most non-Irish speakers like the idea of a first official language even on a symbolic level, particularly the way we use official terms in relation to our Parliament, such as the Dáil, the Seanad, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. We use words such as Áras an Uachtaráin, Bord na Móna and Raidio Telefís Éireann in common English.One of the aims of the Bill is to strengthen that because if we move away from the concept of Irish belonging to all the people, including those who do not know Irish fluently, we will move away from the concept which is essential to what we are about, namely, the role of the Irish language as a badge of nationhood and being a separate people and country. That is important in the context of how we view the Irish language as a people.As somebody who uses Irish in everyday life, the attraction of the language for me is not as a minority language but as the historic and current first language of this State, mar an chéad teanga oifigiúil. There are those who for one reason or another are not fluent in Irish, who have the same love of the language and who feel the same ownership of it. One of my main aims is to revert to the situation, from which we were slowly moving away, where in the naming of public bodies Irish was not always a céim síos.I hope those who do not speak Irish will not see this as something just for Gaeilgeoirí but for themselves also and that they too will take ownership of it. I count on it that they will welcome a much greater visibility for the Irish language in public life. I hope the position regarding public headed notepaper, for example, will be changed. One would need to get the magnifying glass to read the name in Irish. That is unnecessary. In the past those names were either larger or took equal prominence.Molaim an Bille seo don Teach. Tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht bríomhar, macánta, oscailte air agus go léireofar malairt agus éagsúlacht tuairimí. Beidh mise ag éisteacht agus beidh mé ag súil le Céim an Choiste agus Céim na Tuarascála den Bhille agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bille seo achtaithe agus curtha i bhfeidhm chomh luath agus is féidir.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	195	D'éist mé go cruinn le gach rud a dúirt an tAire agus aontaím go mór leis an chuid is mó. Tá rudaí an-mhaithe sa Bhille seo, níl aon amhras faoi sin, ach tá ceisteanna eile le plé againn inniu freisin. Labharfaidh mé as Béarla ar dtús.This is an important Bill. It is a historic occasion indeed that following the foundation of the State and Bunreacht na hÉireann, this is the first Bill to regulate the use of Irish and promote it at State and national level. It certainly gives equal right to use Irish or English, as one wishes, to any State or Government body. It imposes an obligation on Departments to provide service as Gaeilge if that is how people want to do business. It is practical and realistic that a proper and reasonable scheme is drawn up by each Minister which will service the 5% of the population a bhíonn ag labhairt Gaeilge inniú.We need to reflect more on the print on the Bill head, on the dusty dull law that may or may not mean anything. It does not mean anything if the people do not speak the language. We have spent millions of pounds and euro since independence on the Irish language. How effectively was that money spent? I do not doubt the integrity of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, or his commitment. Everybody knows how committed he is on a personal level to the Gaeltacht, to Gaeilge and the Irish culture. He does not doubt the integrity of any of us. As he said, he wants an honest and open debate, and we will certainly have that today.The reality is that our Irish language policy has failed in the past. If we compare the map of the Gaeltacht as it was in the 1920s with the Gaeltacht now we see a great narrowing of the Gaeltacht area. The reasons for that were both political and economic, particularly economic. Many people had to leave the Gaeltacht in those days. When they went to America or England, they found they did not have Béarla go leor agus gan Béarla, gan post – no English, no job, if they did not have English they could not get a job. That one economic factor destroyed a lot of the Gaeltacht areas. The other issue was that these indigenous areas on the west coast of Ireland were poorer in terms of natural resources and lacked infrastructure and industry. As a result jobs were not available locally. There was no economic benefit from speaking Irish although there was clearly spiritual benefit in the broader sense.I cannot but praise the people, particularly those in the west, who have preserved Irish culture for thousands of years. The last bastions of the Celtic language in Ireland have been pushed back to the current limits in Donegal, west Kerry, Connemara and small places in Counties Cork and Waterford.We must do more than pass this Bill. This is the black and white, the legislation, but we need to reawaken in our schools and culture a positive, constructive, proactive view towards the Irish language. It is in the realm of TG4, Raidio na Gaeltachta, Foinse and popular cultural activities that the future of the Irish language lies. We are the custodians of that but we also represent the collective deficit in a sense. What we have lost in the last century or so of the Irish language we must now try to replace. This Bill gives a legal foundation to this aim but if it is not in the hearts and minds of the people, or if it is not what the young people in the Public Gallery want to feel, think, say, watch and do, it will not mean anything and Irish will continue to be marginalised in our social life and our communities. This Bill goes a long way towards building that foundation.Tá rudaí eile tábhachtacha sa Bhille seo. Ó thaobh stair na hÉireann agus na Gaeilge de, tá sé soiléir gurbh í an Ghaeilge príomhteanga mhuintir na hÉireann go dtí an 19ú aois. Nuair a tháinig mé isteach bhí mé ag léamh "Poems of the Dispossessed" i nDuanaire. Má tá duine ar thriall an ghnáthÉireannaigh roimh an 19ú aois, is sna scéalta agus sna dánta a gheofar iad agus a gcuid saibhris. Ba chóir go mbeadh na bunscoileanna ag léamh leabhair mar seo do na daoine óga. Níl aon mhaith nó aon ghá bheith ag baint le cúrsaí gramadaí. Theip leis an módh múinteoireachta sin. Tá múinteoireacht an chultúir Gaelaigh uainn anois. Tá rich, vibrant cultural heritage ann. The true, historic culture of the Celtic Irish is found in our poems and stories. Much of it was lost but much has also been collected by the Irish Folklore Commission. Ba chóir go mbeadh béim níos mó sna scoileanna ar na rudaí sin agus gan bac leis an ghramadach agus leis an tseanslí leis an Ghaeilge a theagasc.Rinne Conradh na Gaeilge an-jab ar fad do mhuintir na hÉireann agus don Ghaeilge. Bhí an-bhaint ag lucht an chonartha le polaitíocht freisin i gcúrsaí náisiúnachais. Is é Conradh na Gaeilge a spreag suim sa Ghaeilge 100 bliain ó shin agus tá gá mór go fóill le Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus na daoine aga bhfuil suim sa Ghaeilge leis an teanga a mhuscailt agus a choimeád leis an ghnáthdhuine. Molaim an obair atá déanta acu.Níl aon amhras ná go ndearna na Bráithre Críostaí agus na mná rialta an-obair fosta. Beidh cuimhne go deo ag gach duine a chuaigh ar scoil leis na Bráithre Críostaí ar an mhódh múinteoireachta Gaeilge agus cultúir a bhí acu. Rinne siad a seacht ndícheall ar son na Gaeilge cé nár thaitinn na módhanna a bhí acu nuair a bhí dalta faoin leathar.Sa bhliain 1922, nuair a fuair muid ár gcuid saoirse, bhí muintir na hÉireann an-bháúil ar fad don pholasaí náisiúnachais a bhí ag achan duine. Is dóigh liom gurb é an cogadh cathardha a scrios gach rud ar fad. Roimh an chogaidh sin bhí gach duine an-bháúil ar fad don nGaeilge ach nuair a tháinig an t-easaontas mór imeasc mhuintir na hÉireann ba bhriseadh an-mhór é sin ó thaobh an chultúir Ghaeilge a cur ar aghaidh. B'fhéidir nach gcreideann gach duine é sin ach measaim nach bhfuil aon dabht faoi.Tháinig m'athair féin ó Ghaeltacht Chiarraí. Bhain sé amach an teastas timire Gaeilge agus chuaigh sé ag múineadh i nDúrlas Éile. Tar éis bheith ag múineadh i rith an lae théadh sé ag rothaíocht timpeall ag reachtáil ranganna Gaeilge. Théadh sé go dtí an Teampall Mór agus go dtí áiteanna eile. Bhíodh slua mór de dhaoine fásta aige, a raibh suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus a bhí ag iarraidh í a labhairt agus a cleachtadh. Fuair sé an-spreagadh ar fad ón suim mhór a bhí ann ag an am sin. Cad a tharla don suim sin? An bhfuil sí ann go fóill nó an bhfuil sí imithe? Caithfimid go léir an suim sa Ghaeilge agus i gcúrsaí Gaeilge a mhúscailt arís.Tá athrú mór tagtha ar léarscáil na Gaeltachta ó bunaíodh an Stát. Ó fuair mé an post seo mar úrlabhraí Gaeltachta is iomaí duine a dúirt liom nach raibh mórán Gaeilge acu ach gur cuimhin leo dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht nuair a bhí siad óg. Tá cuimhne an-mhaith ag aon duine, óg nó aosta, a bhí sa Ghaeltacht ariamh agus tá áit speisialta ag daoine a chuaigh go dtí an Ghaeltacht nuair a bhíodar óg. Caithfear an Ghaeltacht a coimeád chun an Ghaeilge a cur ar fáil do dhaoine. Caithfear níos mó áiseanna chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht dos na daoine óga a théann ann i rith an tsamhraidh. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh níos mó chaitheamh aimsire ag na daoine óga a fhreastalann ar na coláistí Gaeltachta. Tuigimíd go léir nach mbíonn an aimsir go ró-mhaith sa Ghaeltacht de ghnáth, fiú amhán i rith an tsamhraidh, agus tá easpa mhór ann maidir le linn snámha agus le háiseanna chaitheamh aimsire atá oiriúnach d'aimsir fliuch. Ba chóir pleanáil forbartha níos fearr a dhéanamh don nGaeltacht ó thaobh chaitheamh aimsire de. Níl aon dabht ach gur rud an-mhaith é daoine óga a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Tá triúir mhac agam-sa agus tá an duine is sine acu 19 d'aois. Bhíomar a fiafraí de ar mhaith leis dul go dtí an Fhrainc nó go dtí an Ghaeltacht ar saoire i mbliana agus dúirt sé gurb fhearr leis dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht. Bhí mé sásta faoi sin. Más rud é go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a leathnú caithfear níos mó daoine óga a mhealladh chuig an Ghaeltacht agus áiseanna níos fearr a chur ar fáil dóibh.Tá féachaint níos doimhne ag muintir an iarthar ná mar atá ag muintir an oirthir, ar an gcultúr Gaelach ach go háirithe. Tá suim níos mó acu ann agus eolas níos mó acu ar chultúr na hÉireann. Tá saibhreas cultúrtha ag an ghnáth duine san iarthar. Bhí mé ag muineadh ar feadh na mblianta fada i nDroichead Átha agus rinne mé cupla iarracht ar Ghaeilge a mhúineadh do pháistí. Déarfaidís liom, "What is this all about, why are you teaching us this language, what good is it to us and what am I going to get out of this Irish? I want to be a fitter or a mechanic". Ní raibh aon cheangal ag an pháiste óg leis an Ghaeilge nó leis an chultúr Gaelach. Caithfear aidhm speisialta a bheith ann ó thaobh mhúineadh na Gaeilge de, go mórmhór do dhaoine san oirthear.Rud an-mhaith atá san mBille, is é sin go mbeidh postanna ann do dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus go bhfuil sé soiléir go mbeidh sé de dhualgas ar na heagrais Stáit daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu a chur ar fáil chun freastail ar lucht na Gaeilge i measc an phobail. Caithfimid níos mó aird a thabhairt ar na daoine óga, ar an dearcadh atá acu ar an saol agus ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge. Tuigimid go léir cén mhaitheas a dhéanann sé an Ghaeilge a foghlaim ach ní thuigeann páistí scoile é. Caithfear smaoineamh níos mó a dhéanamh ar mhódhanna múinte Gaeilge.Tá sé cinnte gur loit an Ghaeilge éigeanntach, mar a bhí, suim na ndaoine sa Ghaeilge. Le blianta fada, ní fhéadfaí an t-ard teistiméireacht a fháil gan pas sa Ghaeilge. Níor rud maith é sin. Tá sé éigeanntach anois an Ghaeilge a dhéanamh mar ábhar agus sin rud maith. Tá sé soiléir anois gur féidir le duine óg a rogha féin a dhéanamh agus níl an Ghaeilge á bhrú mar a bhíodh. Daoine an-mhacánta ab ea na daoine a bhí ag brú an mheoin sin ar mhuintir na hÉireann ach níor éirigh leo. Ní éireodh go deo le daoine a bhfuil an dearcadh sin acu.Tá tuairimí Chonradh na Gaeilge nochtaithe ag an eagras sin. Scríobh an conradh chugam agus seo a thuairimí ar an mBille:Is é an phríomh aidhm atá againn mar eagraíocht ina thaobh seo, seirbhísí Gaeilge gan dua a bheith ar fáil don phobal. Ina theannta sin, ní foláir don Stát géilleadh don mBunreacht agus don Ghaeilge mar theanga náisiúnta agus mar phríomh theanga oifigiúil agus do na hordaithe bunreachtúil a theascraíonn as sin, mar a dhearbhaigh an Breitheamh Hardiman sa Chúirt Uachtarach.Ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de, ní foláir don Stát gach tacaíocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge inti. Ní hamhlaidh atá faoi láthair, áfach. Is ag brú Béarla tríd is tríd a bhíonn an Stát agus a chuid ball, faraor. Ní foláir don Stát feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge sa limistéar Gaeltachta agus dea-shampla a thabhairt tríd an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga oibre aige ann.Is dóigh liom gurb é sin an pointe is mó atá ag Conradh na Gaeilge. Níl an t-eagras sásta go bhfuil go leor teagmháil á dhéanamh idir an Ghaeilge agus an Stát sa Ghaeltacht agus tá sé ag rá gur cheart go mbeadh ceangal níos láidre ann. Deir Conradh na Gaeilge gur cheart go mbeadh sé mar aidhm ag an Stát go ndéanfar gnó trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus go ndéarfar sin go soléir. Measann an conradh nach bhfuil sin á sholáthar san mBille seo. Tá cearta áirithe leagtha síos san mBille ach níl siad ann go bunúsach.Scaip an conradh billeog ar fud na tíre a bhfuil "Cothram na Féinne don Ghaeilge" mar theideal air.Deir Conradh na Gaeilge:Tá i bhfad níos mó i gceist le teanga ná meán cumarsáide: is í an nasc is bríomhara idir daoine í. Is súil eile ar an saol gach teanga. Múnlaíonn sí meon aigne an chainteora agus seibhríonn sí ár gcomhoidhreacht dhaonna.Dúirt an conradh go bhfuil gá le seirbhísí Gaeilge ó chomhlachtaí poiblí gan cheist sa Ghaeltacht agus gur cheart don Ghaeltacht bheith mar aonad riaracháin a riarfaí trí Ghaeilge uaidh. Nuair a bhí an Bille sa Seanad, dúirt an tAire nach ionann an Ghaeilge in achan Gaeltacht agus go bhfuil áiteanna sna Gaeltachtaí nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge iontu.

Sin ceist mhór bhunúsach agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire ag amharc uirthi agus caithfimid féachaint an-righinn uirthi mar más rud é go bhfuil sin fíor cuireann sé isteach ar na daoine sna fíor-Ghaeltachtaí. Más rud é go bhfuil cúngú níos mó ag teacht ar an Ghaeltacht, caithfimid seo a fhreagairt ó thaobh cearta na nGaeilgeoirí a theastaíonn uatha a ngnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge.Deir daoine eile gur féidir nach bhfuil a lán Gaeilge sa cheantar sin ach tá vótaí ann agus úsáideann siad iad sa toghchán don údarás. Caithfimid scrúdú a dhéanamh air sin freisin. Tá orainn bheith i ndáiríre faoin ghníomh seo. Caithfimid an Ghaeilge a neartú ach caithfidh an Ghaeltacht bheith fíor.Beidh ar chomhlachtaí poiblí freagra as Gaeilge a thabhairt do chomhfhreagas as Gaeilge. Is amhlaidh atá cúrsaí le comhfhreagas as Gaeilge chuig an Aontas Eorpach – má chuirtear ceist an Aontas Eorpach as Gaeilge, gheofar freagra as Gaeilge.

Pointe a bhí ag baill na comhdhála ná go mbeadh an cur síos atá ar na teangacha oifigiúla sa Bhunreacht in úsáid sa mBille, go ndéanfaí comhfhreagras i nGaeilge leis an Stát a fhreagairt i nGaeilge agus go mbeadh comhsheasamh ag an nGaeilge ar fhoirmeacha agus fhógraí.

Seo an pointe is mó idir Chonradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus an Rialtas – go mbeidh seirbhísí i nGaeilge ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta ó chomhlachtaí poiblí gan cheist. Tuigim go bhfuil a lán sa Bhille ag iarraidh sin a chur i bhfeidhm ach tá leasuithe molta ag an chonradh agus ag an chomhdháil. Tá a fhios agam mar bhí mé suas go dtí a 2 a.m. aréir á scríobh agus tá siad in oifig na gceist anois. Sin croí na difriíochta atá eadrainn.Luaigh na heagraíochtaí fosta nach bhfuil sé inghlactha go mbeadh mír sa Bhille a chuireann bac ar an saoránach dul chun na cúirte sa gcás nach bhfuil na nithe atá á ngeallúint faoin Bhille ar fáil dó. Más rud go deir an coimisinéar nach n-aontaíonn sé le duine, níl cead aige dul chun na cúirteanna chun a chearta a bhaint amach agus ní cheart sin.Deirtear liom nach bhfuil go leor múinteoirí le Gaeilge agus iad a bheith báúil don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó ann. Ní bheidh daoine óga na Gaeltachtaí sásta Gaeilge a labhairt muna bhfuil na múinteoirí ábalta an teanga a labhairt ar leibhéal níos airde ná leibheál na bunscoile mar muna bhfuil an múinteoir ábalta á labhairt, sin comhartha nach bhfuil ann ach teanga marbh.Níl seirbhísí siceolaíochta ar fáil as Gaeilge sna scoileanna. Más Gaeilgeoir duine, caithfidh go bhfuil sé nó sí in ann caint leis an síceolaí as Gaeilge, sin rud bunúsach. B'fhéidír go bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus Eolaíoichta ag féachaint air sin ag an bomaite seachas rudaí eile ara bhfuil sé ag féachaint faoi láthair.Tá Bord Sláinte an Iarthair tar éis banaltra scoile agus í gan Gaeilge a fhostú.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Tá an Bille seo os comhair na Dála in ndeireadh thiar thall. Foilsíodh an Bille in Aibreán 2002, níos mó ná bliain ó shin. I dtús báire ba é an Ghearrtheideal a bhí ar an mBille ná, Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Comhionannas) 2002. Ghlac an Seanad le leasú ón Aire chun an téarma, "comhionannas" a bhaint as an nGearrtheideal. Dá bhrí sin tá an Ghearrtheideal nua seo ar an mBille, Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Tá an Teideal Fada athraithe freisin. Tá an choincheap comhionannais bainte as an Teideal Fada ar mheon bhunreachtúil. Is é a deir an Bunreacht gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta agus an chéad theanga oifigiúil agus gur dara teanga oifigiúil í an Béarla. Ós rud é nach féidir aon rud atá i gcoinne an Bhunreachta a chur isteach i reachtaíocht, ghlac an Seanad leis na leasaithe ón Aire a bhain leis sin.Bhí mé ag smaoineamh ar m'óráid-se don díospóireacht ar an Dara Chéim de Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. I dtús báire bhí sé ar intinn agam labhairt go hiomlán as Gaeilge ach in ndeireadh na dála tháinig mé ar an gcinneadh seo: mo chuid ama a roinnt idir Ghaeilge agus Béarla. Bhí cúis an-thábhachtach agam leis seo, cúis a luaigh an t-Aire níos luaithe. Tá díospóireacht leathan, mácanta, oscailte a bheadh saor ó bhrú ag teastáil sa tír seo ar cheist na Gaeilge. Dá mba rud é go labhróinn go hiomlán as Gaeilge bheadh seans beag ann go dtabharfadh na nuachtóirí ó na meáin cumarsáide Béarla aon aird ar a bhfuil le rá agam. Ar ndóigh, a mhalairt a bheadh ann ó na nuachtáin agus na hirisí Gaeilge, ó Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4. An rud atá uaim ná cabhrú chomh mór agus is féidir le díospóireacht taobh amuigh den Teach seo a spreagadh. Tá an díospóireacht sin thar a bheith tábhachtach. Muna ghlacann muintir na hÉireann úinéireacht dheimhneach ar an nGaeilge is beag feabhas a thiocfaidh ar an scéal.Níl sé ar intinn agam an Bille a scrúdú ar mhion cheisteanna nó ar cheisteanna teicniúla. Beidh an seans sin againn ar Cheim an Choiste. B'fhearr liom, um an dtaca seo, labhairt faoin mBille i gcomhthéacs cheist na Gaeilge go hiomlán.Any legislation that comes before the Dáil needs to be scrutinised in regard to a number of fundamental questions. What problem is it seeking to address? Does it offer the most effective way of addressing a particular problem? How much will it cost to implement all the provisions of the legislation? Does it give real value for money to the taxpayer and is its implementation practical and justified? Who really wants it?On 19 February, at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív presented the draft strategy statement of his Department. He stated that, for the purposes of the strategy statement, the Department's work had been grouped into four main areas with goals identified for each.With regard to the maintenance and promotion of the Irish language, the Department's goal is to increase the use of the Irish language countrywide and to support the maintenance of the language in the Gaeltacht areas. The commitment of the Government to this goal is questionable, particularly in light of the 22% reduction in the allocation to Údarás na Gaeltachta for grants to industries and capital expenditure on buildings. This is against the backdrop of significant net job losses in the Gaeltacht. In view of such job losses, people are increasingly being forced to seek employment outside the Gaeltacht, which is having a further negative impact on the maintenance of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht areas.Considering this goal, to what extent does the implementation of the Official Languages Bill serve its achievement and is this the best way to use available funds in pursuit of that goal? The Department has done no effective costing of the full implementation of the Bill. In terms of implementing the provisions of the Bill the supply of people with sufficient fluency in the Irish language is a real problem. Addressing the question "Who really wants this Bill?". I was amazed to be told by someone from Connemara, at the recent Labour Party national conference, that there was no great knowledge of the Bill in Connemara. I certainly had taken it that the opposite was the case and perhaps the Minister could enlighten me further on that issue.I am concerned that, in general, only a small minority of people know about the Bill or are interested in its passage into law. I am of the view that interest in the Irish language is waning in the Gaeltacht and in the Galltacht simultaneously. Nowhere was this better illustrated than in social partnership agreement 2003 to 2005 document, Sustaining Progress, which was produced by the Government and the social partners. The only Irish in the document is on the first page where the notice from the publisher, the Stationery Office, is in both Irish and English.The forward to the document is signed by the Taoiseach, so there is an Irish word there. However, I have been unable to find any Irish or reference to the Irish language in this document. When we get down to the business of what really matters to us, the Irish language does not figure in our considerations. Not many people know about or are interested in this legislation.Sustaining Progress deals at length with delivering quality public services and includes sections on education at all levels and modernisation of the Civil Service and local authorities. Despite the fact that the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002 was before the Oireachtas when Sustaining Progress was negotiated and concluded, the Irish language did not figure in the social partnership agreement for 2003 to 2005. This is a damning indictment of the Government's commitment to the Bill and to the Irish language in general.If the Government and the social partners had declared their support for the Bill in Sustaining Progress, it would have engendered a significant and much needed debate which would have informed the public regarding the Bill. This represents a lost opportunity to cultivate support for the Irish language in general and for the provisions of this Bill, in particular. I have long put forward the view that unless and until there is a full and frank national debate leading to the population at large adopting a proactive ownership of the Irish language, any other measures are doomed to limited, if any, success.I wish to outline the questions that need to be addressed in this debate. Should we seek to revive the Irish language? If we wish to revive it, why is this desirable? What are the appropriate measures necessary to maximise the revival? If it is desirable to revive the Irish language, what are we prepared to do, individually and collectively, to advance this objective with all haste? The latter is perhaps the most important question we must ask. Strong actions, not words, are required. The establishment of Coimisiún na Galltachta is a possible vehicle to stimulate this process. The vast majority of the population has not engaged in any meaningful way with the Irish language question. Unless and until the community at large takes up ownership of the Irish language, free of elitism and fanaticism, the prospects of halting decline are scant indeed. The Irish language belongs to all the people and I was pleased the Minister said so as it should be clearly stated again and again.I refer now to an issue which I have already raised in the House with the Minister regarding the multicultural Ireland that has developed and continues to develop. The Minister has already made substantial changes to the original Bill, the Official Languages (Equality) Bill, based on Article 8.1 of the Constitution, which states that the Irish language is the national language and the first official language. Article 8.2 states that the English language is a second official language. The Bill as originally presented could therefore have been interpreted as contrary to the Constitution. We should bear that in mind – the Constitution states that English is a second official language, not the second official language. The Bill does not state this.In 1937, when the Constitution was drafted, voted on and passed into law, we did not have a multicultural Ireland so the issue of official languages other than English and Irish did not arise. The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill, which is similar to this Bill, has been denounced by the Commission for Racial Equality in the UK as racist. The Commission is concerned that giving too much prominence to Scotland's indigenous language could offend other ethnic minorities and damage race relations. I acknowledge the UK does not have a written Constitution. I understand that the Chinese community in Ireland numbers 50,000, in or about the population of Waterford city, which I represent. Scotland has fewer than 60,000 Gaelic speakers. What is the real figure for Irish speakers in Ireland? Perhaps the Minister knows. He should address this when summing up.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	206	We should not be afraid to debate issues such as this and not react to them in a hostile, angry way from our trenches.We should preserve and develop the use of the Irish language. Its cultural value makes it a national treasure. The Irish language movement has nothing to fear from full, open and frank debate. If people believe that it is a waste of time and money to revive the language, they should be encouraged to state their views without fear or intimidation. The revival of the Irish language tended to be a God value in the State and those who did not share that view have in the past been scorned as being anti-Irish. That mindset is changing but all shades of opinion must be encouraged to participate freely and openly in the kind of debate which is the only real prospect for progress in the revival of the Irish language.We are spending a great deal of money on the Irish language and we are certainly not achieving results commensurate with that investment. We need to examine and analyse what we are doing in a comprehensive way. We do not know precisely how much money the State and local authorities are spending on Irish. A great deal of money is provided for the educational system at all levels. Children, on completion of primary education, have had eight years of Irish, yet two years later they can have a fluency in a continental language that they do not have in Irish. Outside the school environment there is little incentive to use the Irish language. Changing the public's commitment to the Irish language in a positive proactive way is basic to providing the supportive environment to encouraging primary school children to use the Irish they learn at school in the world outside the school. Obviously if parents are sympathetic and committed it is tremendous and the greatest motivation children can have.Networking between families genuinely committed to the Irish language in localities would make a considerable contribution to increasing the use of Irish countrywide. Children must be made to realise that Irish is not just something they must learn in school as a sort of penance. There is no doubt that motivated pupils will learn quicker. They must learn that both inside and outside school the Irish language and culture can bring much joy to them and add to their lives.When we consider the vast amounts of money spent on Irish at all levels of education we must ask what is the strategic objective in regard to teaching of Irish throughout the education system. For many years I was under the misapprehension that public policy was the creation of a bilingual society in Ireland. However, I found out that there was no real public policy regarding Irish. Any nation that does not have a strategic policy for an important area of its national life, like its native language, will undoubtedly not achieve that objective. The Minister's strategic goal is much more modest than achieving universal bilingualism in Ireland but is probably more realistic. Any entity that seeks to achieve an objective of the scale of reviving a national language that does not have a clear objective, a well thought-out programme, the resources to implement that programme and an effective monitoring system will certainly achieve limited success.The Bill focuses on the Oireachtas, public bodies and the courts but it is absolutely vital that the political parties should be brought under the provisions of the Bill if we are really serious in regard to Irish. Political parties should be clearly named in the Bill and it should be noted that those parties now receive a considerable part of their income from the State. If the provisions of the Bill do not apply to the political parties, the sincerity and commitment of the Oireachtas as a whole must be very seriously questioned. The Oireachtas should lead on this issue and set the headline for the rest of the country.The Office of the Official Languages Commissioner is a meritorious proposal. Concerns are being expressed regarding the provisions in the Bill which on one hand provide for appeals of decisions of the Commissioner to the High Court on a point of law, while on the other hand providing that the Act will not confer a right of action in civil proceedings in respect of any failure to comply with a statutory scheme under the Act. It also provides that no civil or criminal proceedings shall lie in any court against the Commissioner and his or her staff in respect of acts done in good faith by the Commissioner and his or her staff.Whereas the curtailment of individual rights is something that should normally be strongly opposed, this is one occasion when I believe that it is the right course of action. The independence of the Commissioner and the status of the office is paramount.The Minister has presented the Official Languages Commissioner as an ombudsman, in effect, and I go along with that point of view. There is also the very real danger that if a right of action in civil proceedings were provided, it could very well prove to be an expensive crank's charter.Tá na tuairimí seo leagtha amach agam agus glacaim go bhfuil an tAire i ndáiriíre mar gheall ar an mBille seo. Táim cinnte gur oibrigh sé go dian air agus go bhfuil a chroí san áit cheart. I ndeireadh na dála, an cheist atá agamsa dó ná an í seo an tslí is fearr cabhrú leis an Ghaeilge sa Gaeltacht agus sa Ghalltacht? Bhi Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ann agus tá a mholtaí ag an Aire agus tá sé ag iarraidh iad a chur if bhfeidhm ag an noiméad. Tá mé a rá leis le fada, afach, agus tá fhios agam nach n-aontaíonn sé liom, go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh coimisiún na Galltachta againn le díospóireacht a spreagadh sna bailte, san sráidbhailte, sna cathracha agus ar fud na tíre ar fad ar an Ghaeilge. Tuigeann an tAire go bhfuil dea-mhéin ag an bpobal don Ghaeilge. B'fheidir go bhfuil sé sin fíor ach dea-mhéin bog atá ann.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I indicated my overall opposition to the Commission's proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 27-28 January 2003. The proposals would constitute a significant reorientation of the CAP and, therefore, require detailed and comprehensive analysis. My objective in the negotiations, which are ongoing, is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement to ensure the best possible ongoing level of support and protection for our production base. It is envisaged that the pace of the discussions will intensify over the coming weeks.

When does he believe agreement will be reached and when will the next meeting of the Council of Ministers be held? He stated that the Government is opposed to the Fischler proposals as, indeed, is Fine Gael. Will he outline the main reasons it is opposed to them? Does he believe there will be a detrimental knock-on effect on businesses in small towns and on the food processing industry, notwithstanding the fact that the most important component is that we have a viable agriculture industry, the foundation of which is the farmers and the producers? Is the Minister concerned that if we move to this new system, which is not production based, there may be a dramatic fall in production and that in the future it may be a little easier for the Commission to cease, or to dramatically reduce, payments or subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	209	In relation to the negotiations and the pace of them, as I mentioned, the detailed proposals were put before the Council of Ministers in January of this year. Last year, of course, there was an intimation and a leaking of those proposals but the formal proposal were put on the table in January. Since then much healthy debate has taken place among the social partners. The Department has held a number of seminars and public meetings. We also got economists in Teagasc and FAPRI to look at the likely implications.Negotiations have accelerated in recent weeks and a determined effort is being made by the Commission and the Greek Presidency to bring finality to them by the end of the Greek Presidency which is the end of June. I cannot say whether that will be achieved. All I can say is that there seems to be a greater urgency in the past couple of weeks. Having deliberated for a numbers of months, at least one of the main farming organisations, the Irish Farmers Association, has come out on one of the main issues, decoupling.The proposals are profound and have extreme implications for Irish agriculture because they signal a change in direction. The difficulty about the negotiations in relation to decoupling, for example, is that if full, comprehensive decoupling was to come in, it would be almost irreversible because if farmers cease production, it would be very difficult to get a new generation of farmers back into production in the next decade. The mid-term proposals, if adopted, would change the nature of agriculture and will have profound implications, both upstream and downstream, for supply to farmers and the inputs to farming and, on the other side, for the processing of farm products in the processing industry.The debate which has taken and is taking place is very helpful. I want to go into the final serious part of these negotiations with a unified position. I am pleased Fine Gael and parties in the Dáil generally are supportive of the national position in relation to these negotiations. The farming organisations and the industry generally are supportive as well. It is important in critical international negotiations to speak with one voice because one is then in a much stronger position. The next Council of Ministers meeting is next week and I do not expect to have any radical new proposals for that meeting. I believe the June meeting will be the critical one.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I urge the Minister to fight for the best deal possible for this country. There are people who find certain aspects of the Fischler proposals attractive but I believe if the Fischler proposals come in in their entirety, particularly the one on break from production, we will see an acceleration in the flight of farmers from the land and a drop in prices in the next couple of years. Farmers may think the removal of red tape will solve all their woes, but the increased emphasis on farm compliance will cause a lot of difficulties for them.The Minister was right to speak about a system being put in place to take away the incentive from production. Unlike other industries, which can be cranked up very quickly, it will take a little longer in agriculture. If that link is broken, it will be very difficult. It may be said we are overproducing and we have to find markets but no matter what industry one is involved in, one must go out and find a market. That is part and parcel of production. If the proposals come in, what will be the impact on other agriculture related industries, including the processing industry and small businesses in rural areas?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Both studies, including the FAPRI one, indicated that there would be a substantial drop in our suckler herd and in the ewe flock. That would lead to a drop in the volume of sheepmeat and beef going through our factories which would have a very serious effect on jobs, on throughput and on the critical mass of product going through the plants. It would certainly lead to uneconomic plants in certain areas. Co-operatives and supply firms in towns and villages supplying farms would also be badly affected. It is important to retain our production base.The new system should be simple and not as complex as the present one – in other words, there should not be as much bureaucracy. Some of the proposals put forward in relation to partial decoupling, for example, would be neither here nor there. There would be some decoupling, but we would have properly more complex type schemes. I want a simple practical outcome which would retain the benefits of Agenda 2000 to Ireland and ensure that in any rejigging of the finances, Ireland, as a member state, will not lose out.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I regret that the industrial action taken by members of the CPSU is continuing and inconveniencing farmers in the five counties involved. However, I understand that the union has agreed to ease restrictions in relation to herds affected by brucellosis and tuberculosis and this is being pursued with the union. The Department has temporarily suspended the necessity to get advance clearance from the CMMS data for animals intended for local slaughter houses. Department officials met the CPSU last week and while no resolution to the dispute emerged, my officials are having ongoing talks with CPSU representatives in an effort to resolve this dispute.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The strike is now in its ninth week. The Minister referred to inconvenience to farmers but I suggest it is more serious than that. Enormous hardship is being experienced by some farmers who, on account of this strike, cannot process their animal sales for instance. I realise the issue of animal welfare has been accounted for, which I welcome, but this matter has significant financial implications for a very large number of farmers. Those on strike are suffering as well. Is there any possibility of intervention to help resolve this problem before it escalates?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	214	To reiterate, I regret the inconvenience and difficulties being experienced by both the producers and the people on strike. This industrial action is contrary to partnership. There are mechanisms within the partnership arrangements to resolve issues as they arise and they should be used in this case. I am hopeful that a resolution to this dispute will emerge from the discussions with the CPSU which have taken place over the past week and which are taking place this afternoon.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	216	He is taking them separately.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I understand that Priority Questions must be taken separately.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I thank the Minister for his reply on the discussions but there two other points I would like to raise. A request has been made that the steering committee which oversees the partnership talks might get involved and promote a resolution. It cannot be overlooked that one farmer has already received a court order directing the Department to lift the restriction on his farm and to release the cards that he needs to sell his animals. Has the Minister a comment to make on that and its potential implications in the event that the problem escalates?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I can confirm that the steering committee has become involved in this dispute to seek a resolution. The Department and I want to have this dispute resolved amicably because it is causing inconvenience and difficulty. Some people are precluded from disposing of their cattle, especially because of the bad weather. Therefore, we all want to see a resolution.On the Deputy's second point, Judge Harvey Kenny made a judgment yesterday in Galway Circuit Court directing that the ID cards of animals of a farmer in Mayo be returned to that farmer. That order is being observed and the implications of the decision are being studied by the legal people in the Department. The issue is due to be dealt with again in court next Tuesday so I am precluded from making any other comment because of the sub judice restrictions.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Last year was a difficult one for farming and it followed a number of relatively favourable years. Teagasc estimated that farm family income increased by 43% between 1999 and 2001.The vision and long-term strategy for the development of the agriculture and food sector is set down in the Agri-Food 2010 Plan of Action. The current challenges confronting the sector were comprehensively addressed in the partnership agreement recently concluded with the social partners. The agriculture element of the partnership document is valued in excess of €300 million over the three year lifespan of the programme and it could be greater depending on the take-up on the agri-environment schemes. The document sets out agreed objectives with regard to agriculture, negotiating positions with regard to CAP reform and the WTO and commitments on the development of the beef, dairy and food sectors. There are significant provisions concerning the implementation of the nitrates directive and improvements to the REP, farm waste management and dairy hygiene schemes. There are reviews of the special areas of conservation and forestry schemes. The animal health provisions seek to reduce levels of TB, brucellosis and BSE in the national herd.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Does the Minister agree that farm incomes dropped by 8% in 2002? What other sector would put up with that? The poor quality of soil in 2002, coupled with the weather this year, makes one wonder if circumstances will be the same this year. I hope this will not happen. If it does, has the Minister plans to address the problem?I am thankful that there is an increase in cattle prices this week, which have been bad. When the sheds were full with cattle for the past two months there was no indication that the Government had intended to do anything about it. The strike in the agricultural offices is causing hardship for farmers. The Minister said he regrets the strike but that is no good to a farmer depending on headage payments and premium payments, who has a big family and needs money for children going to school. It is not good that such a farmer cannot get his blue cards back.Has the Minister any news on his application to the EU for the over-50 premiums? Will the Government be opting for full decoupling or partial decoupling? Why was there such a delay in the appeals system concerning the milk quota? If farmers want to plan ahead, there is no point in telling them in March or April that they will not get an extra milk quota if they submitted an application last September? How can they plan ahead in such circumstances?I complimented the Minister on his stand on foot and mouth disease. He did a great job but I cannot compliment him on the way he has handled the agricultural brief in the past 12 months.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Last year was difficult for a number of reasons. As the Deputy said, the weather was extremely poor and caused great difficulty for farmers. The market returns, especially for dairying, came under pressure for the first time in many years. The estimated drop in aggregate income was approximately 8.6% but that was after a number of good years, particularly the previous year, in which farmers' incomes were up very substantially in spite of the problems associated with BSE and foot and mouth disease. That was not the case in some other sectors of the economy, which fared very badly.I am thankful that the weather was much better this spring. Markets appear to be a bit more balanced than they were last year. As the Deputy knows, An Bord Bainne produced its results in recent days, which were very good, and it looks forward to a better balance in international dairy markets.Weanling and store prices are very firm and the live trade has improved considerably. It is up by approximately 139% when one compares the first five months of this year with the first five months of last year. There is a very strong trade for weanlings going to continental Europe and for adult cattle going to the Lebanon. That is creating competition in the market, which is helpful. If the weather continues to be good, I expect a substantial improvement in the agriculture industry in the autumn. Farmers and their co-operatives have a responsibility to ensure that they get the best return from the marketplace and that they have the most efficient operation possible.In dairy, for example, some farmers can produce milk for 40 to 45 cent per gallon, but for others the cost is 75 to 80 cent per gallon, so neither they nor Deputy Breen can blame the Minister of the day for all the problems in farming and in agriculture. I regret that farmers have withdrawn from processing in the beef industry. They were substantially involved up to a decade ago and they have withdrawn one after the other and left the private operators to undertake beef processing. Oganisations such as Kerry Co-op, Golden Vale, Glanbia or Avonmore, as it was then, and Cork Marts IMP were all co-operative which were farmer controlled, but none of them is involved now. We need to be competitive and I expect that this year, not because of anything I do but because of the influence of the weather, will have a big impact on improving the position of farmers for the coming year.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I regret the inconvenience caused to the farming community due to the industrial action taken by the CPSU members and I am anxious to resolve the dispute. Department officials had contact with CPSU representatives in recent days and are meeting CPSU again as we speak. However, no formula for resolving the dispute has emerged. My officials are keeping the talks going and I have encouraged them to seek to resolve this dispute as quickly and as amicably as possible because I want staff to be in their work places rather than outside on picket lines. I want farmers who want to trade in an orderly way their livestock to be allowed to do that and I am hopeful that we will have an early resolution of this dispute.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I thank the Minister for his reply but week in week out this issue has been raised in this House, yet the urgency of resolving it has never struck home with the Minister. The situation has changed drastically since yesterday when a farmer was forced to go into court to get his calves to move them to a factory of the mart. That man must have been desperate to have to take such action. The Minister has stood by and allowed this situation develop and the court action will incur high costs. Surely the precedent has been set that everyone whose calves are held up and cannot be brought to the mart should get them back. Can the Minister not move on that issue? Surely the Minister should use some of the money spent on the court case to try to resolve this dispute. It has changed drastically since yesterday – it is so important it will be mentioned in the House next Tuesday.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Generally speaking, over the past decade or so there have been very good industrial relations between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the staff. The Department has more than 4,000 staff in offices around the country. It is regrettable within the spirit and the terms of partnership agreements that staff go out on strike but it is not of my making. It has serious implications for partnership, the economy and the national finances – that is what partnership is about. There are mechanisms under the partnership programmes, and strike is not an aspect of partnership. Every possible effort is being made to resolve this dispute and obviate the inconvenience and hardship caused to people.In relation to the court case yesterday, I have already answered that the order of the judge is being complied with and the implications are being studied by the legal people in the Department. It is up for mention on Tuesday so I am precluded from making any further comment on the matter.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Is the Minister concerned about food safety or a disease outbreak? Is he happy that everything is in control in that area because I have some questions about it?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I am not happy in that area and I am concerned. First, I took advice from the Food Safety Authority about food and some decisions were taken which are very helpful. I am concerned at the implications of not being able to deal with issues, such as a farmer with a brucellosis herd who cannot dispose of the animals concerned. That is a highly contagious disease and in negotiations with the union we have introduced temporary measures for several brucellosis herds and have been able to deal with them. Nonetheless, that situation should not arise as it has very serious implications for the national herd, for animal disease generally and particularly for diseases as contagious as brucellosis.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The agriculture element of the social partnership agreement entitled Sustaining Progress is valued in excess of €300 million, and could be greater depending on the take-up on the agri-environment schemes, over the three year life of the programme. The document sets out agreed objectives with regard to agriculture, negotiating positions with regard to CAP reform and the WTO and commitments on the development of the beef, dairy and food sectors. There are significant provisions concerning the implementation of the nitrates directive and improvements to the REP, farm waste management and dairy hygiene schemes. There are reviews of the special areas of conservation and forestry schemes. The animal health provisions seek to reduce levels of TB, brucellosis and BSE.In terms of adapting agriculture to change, there is provision for a review of the 2010 report, full stamp duty relief and stock relief for young farmers, and an initiative to reduce the burden of land annuities. The Government will examine with the EU Commission the possibility of extending the disadvantaged areas classification to the whole BMW region. There is an objective to build on progress already made with regard to customer service, simplification and the use of computer technology. A comprehensive review procedure is also included in the document.The rates for REPS are to be increased, subject to EU Commission agreement, with a view to increasing participation from 37,000 farmers at present to 55,000 farmers by the end of 2005.Additional InformationOn this basis, the proposed new rates would be: €200 for the first 20 hectares; €175 for the next 20 hectares; and €70 for the next 15 hectares, that is, cumulative, up to a maximum of 55 hectares per holding. This would in effect mean that a REPS farmer with a holding of 20 hectares would receive €4,000 per annum; a holding of 40 hectares would receive €7,500 per annum; and a holding of 55 hectares would receive €8,550 per annum.The farm waste management scheme ceiling has increased to 450 income units and the investment ceiling to €75,000. The investment ceiling for the dairy hygiene scheme shall be increased to €50,000. The Government will also set up an independent appeals committee to deal with appeals put forward by farmers regarding destocking percentages on commonage framework plans.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank the Minister for his detailed reply to that question. Have all the farming organisations now committed to the partnership agreement and, if so, are they happy with the provisions in place there? Will the Minister comment on the special areas of conservation because of the interaction between Dúchas and the Minister's Department?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	230	After a sustained period of deliberations and negotiations the farming pillar agreed to join the partnership. I am sure they are happy about that, as I am. It is a good way to do business and each of the farming organisations and their representative bodies have signed up. It is a very valuable agreement, in particular with the mid-term review negotiations and the world trade talk negotiations coming up where it is important to have a degree of domestic unity. That is why it is important that the talks conclude. The specifics of the agreement are contained in the Sustaining Progress document, particularly on the special areas of conservation and their commonage framework. We have agreement on how to deal with that and we have an appeals body now that the partnership has been agreed. The farming representatives have their nominees on that body under the chairmanship of Dr. Gerry Scully from the west. I hope that we will be able to make progress in that area.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I would like to emphasise the point regarding the SACs that, at least in some parts of the country, there are concerns about their implications for such people. There is a need for serious interaction between Dúchas, the farming organisations and the Department to ensure that those people are reassured regarding the implications of SACs for them.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I thank Deputy Upton for referring to that matter. We all enjoy and support the richness and diversity of the Irish rural landscape, and long may that continue. At the same time, we want traditional commercial farming to take place. Farmers are entitled to the liberty to farm, and there must be interaction between farming representatives, the Department of Agriculture and Food, Dúchas and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure that we can go forward in harmony, protecting our natural environment in rural areas and pursuing commercial farming at the same time.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	233	The Department of Agriculture and Food met Veterinary Ireland, the body that represents temporary veterinary inspectors in the meat inspection service, on 20 December 2002 to discuss TVI shifts in the context of budgetary allocations for 2003. Several issues were discussed, including the need to make the most efficient use of the resources allocated under the Estimates for that purpose, while ensuring that appropriate standards of public health, food safety and animal welfare are met. My Department has also held a series of meetings with the Irish Meat Association and IBEC, which represents the meat processing industry, to discuss the practicalities of implementing efficiencies in the meat inspection service this year and consider how best to provide a more efficient and cost-effective service in future.There has been no disruption of meat processing activity this year as a result of reduced shift allocations. However, the allocations have led to a greater focus at industry level on the service being provided and on identifying ways and means of ensuring continuity of service while improving efficiency, broadening flexibility and delivering value for money. In the context of those discussions, I have already allowed meat plants some flexibility in the use of those resources to enable them to meet their commercial commitments, on the clear understanding that the overall budget for the year must be respected.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	234	There is concern among many of those involved in the meat industry. Much may be rumour, but I would like the Minister to clear up the facts. Is his Department happy with the amount of meat coming in from third countries? I recently heard of a meat processor who was killing 400 animals weekly and is now down to about 60 because of other suppliers. That may be a rumour, but it certainly needs to be addressed and clarified by the Minister.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	235	My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Treacy, will be answering that question on beef imports to Ireland comprehensively. I believe that it is question No. 9.I consider the cost of meat inspection to be extremely high – prohibitively so. I want to have a root and branch examination of inspection with a view to reducing costs while maintaining our high animal health status and ensuring that we have the most rigorous food safety regime in place. Many sectors of the food industry are now self-regulating. Thankfully, many of them have ISO standards, with inspection provided by the relevant control Department. I would like to see much more of that type of supervision regarding inspection facilities. Over the next few months I hope to bring about a streamlining of the whole meat inspection service.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I have two simple questions for the Minister. How does he propose to deal with the issue? He stated that he was having discussions with the veterinary unions, but what would he like to see as their outcome? Is the current difficulty having an impact on output?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	237	There has been no impact on output hitherto, but we must find a resolution. As I said, we have an expensive system and need to have it streamlined. I am talking to the various representative bodies and considering a range of suggestions about how the service might be improved. My Department will shortly initiate discussions with all interested parties with a view to setting in motion a process that will lead to ensuring that the service can reach higher levels of efficiency, provide a greater degree of flexibility and make maximum use of resources while delivering better value for money. In any new arrangement I will ensure that the quality and safety of meat products will continue to be the main priority.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Food Agency Co-operation Council, which was established in 2000 under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Food to promote the fullest practical co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry, last month published a guide entitled Market Led New Product Development in the Food and Drink Industry. The publication's objective is to provide guidance to food and drink companies regarding best practice in new product development and how to improve the new product development success rate, reduce the risk of failure and set out how State agencies can provide services to support the industry in new product development.Studies examining the industry's track record in new product development have found that as many as 90% of all new food and drink products fail to survive more than one year in the marketplace. Among the main reasons for that high failure rate is the fact that the majority of companies engaging in new product development do not have an explicit new product development strategy and do not approach it in a market-oriented fashion. The research highlighted the fact that many companies engaging in new product development are company rather than market led, focusing on internal capability rather than market and consumer demand.The key message emphasised in the guide is that new product development will succeed nowadays only if food and drink companies fully understand the consumer and the nuances of the marketplace. The easy-to-read guide offers a structured approach to the hazards of developing new products and sets out what assistance State agencies can provide at each stage of the process. The guide sets out in a user-friendly way the key tasks that companies should undertake in the new product development process, and two case studies are included to give insights into the experiences of companies in the area. The importance of having a formal, market-focused new product development system to manage all stages of the process actively is emphasised throughout.At the launch of the guide on 1 April, I emphasised the importance of disseminating it, and the approach to new product development set out therein, to the widest possible audience. In addition to a mail shot to all food and drink companies by the Department, the various State agencies involved in the Food Agency Co-operation Council held, or are planning to hold over the coming months, a number of events at which the guide will be rolled out to target audiences. Judging from feedback received to date and demand from companies for additional copies, I am satisfied that the guide has been well received as a useful and practical initiative. I am confident that the excellent advice and guidance provided in it, along with the renewed emphasis by our Department and the state agencies on the importance of approaching new product development in a structured fashion, will assist in improving the success rate of Irish companies involved in new product development in the food sector.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I thank the Minister of State for that detailed and comprehensive review. The cost of developing a new product must be enormous. While I do not have any figures, I presume it would vary significantly from one product to another. There is clearly a huge waste of resources. Some of that is to do with privately owned companies, in which case the cost will presumably be carried by such companies. However, there is also significant State investment in the development of new products. Why is it that ten or 15 years ago we had a number of extremely successful brand leaders with new products developed in this country? What has happened since? We have dipped so far down the scale that a high percentage of new products fail on the market.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	240	There are a number of reasons for this. Ireland has low domestic consumer demand. Almost 90% of all production in Ireland must be exported because there is only the capacity here to consume about 10% of the products created. Based on the fact that the domestic market is small and that some companies may go to the domestic market without having carried out sufficient research, companies may find themselves in a situation where they fail.While we have had brand leaders in the past, companies are now subject to serious competition within the European and global marketplace. In the macro-markets in particular, the bigger companies have the capacity and resources, and can afford the expertise, to create new products and new processes. Nonetheless, we have had brand leaders in the past and still have some, particularly on the drinks side. I am confident that with the current attitude in the corporate food sector in Ireland, there is a strong commitment to research, development and innovation. I hope we will have new brand leaders on the market, perhaps this year.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Does the Minister agree that the time is right to invest more in research and development for food product development? We are cutting research budgets in the food area. Would it not be more productive to invest more in that area?
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The Minister mentioned the comprehensive guidance available. I have encountered a constituent who has put a number of years and virtually all of his income into the development of a food product. Is there assistance the Department could give to such an individual? I am aware that he has received some funding from his local enterprise board.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	243	To return to Deputy Upton's point, I do not accept that the research budget is being cut. We have increased the resources for research massively in recent years. I was delighted recently that University College, Cork, in conjunction with Teagasc, the food research centre in Moorepark and a number of international corporations, was able to secure massive funding for food research and food technology from Science Foundation Ireland.We are prioritising the resources available. We want to become more focused. There cannot be research for its own sake. For too long, we have continued to carry out research and produce reports when only those involved in the production of the reports knew of them. We must ensure that the products researched and the reports produced have a commercial focus, particularly in the food area.In response to Deputy Timmins, assistance and guidance is available from the county and city enterprise boards. There are major feasibility study grants available from Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia. If a particular company has a product or project which we would support, the Department would be delighted to consider it.
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The sale and supply of veterinary medicines is governed at European Union level by a comprehensive and detailed framework of legislation which member states are obliged to implement in the interests, primarily, of the health of consumers of animal products and also of animal health and welfare. These EU obligations are embodied in national regulations which have been enacted under the Animal Remedies Act 1993. Under this legislation, the competent licensing authority is the Irish Medicines Board, except in the case of veterinary vaccines where competence rests with my Department.It will be generally accepted that an area such as this must be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation, which necessarily imposes certain restrictions on what otherwise would be a free market. For example, it is necessary to ensure that the quality and safety of individual products are in accordance with current scientific principles before they are licensed for the market. Furthermore, it is recognised that a medicine which may have potentially harmful effects for users or consumers, or where a professional diagnosis is necessary to determine the precise product to be used in a given circumstance, must be subject to restrictions appropriate to the product concerned.It is also necessary to ensure that distribution systems meet requisite standards in terms of storage and record-keeping in the interests of ensuring full traceability of products being used. That said, the restrictions imposed in respect of products or categories of products must be no more than what is reasonably required to safeguard public and animal health and welfare, and must not be used by any interest group to maximise profit or indulge in restrictive practices.On a more specific level, the House will be aware from replies to a series of parliamentary questions that the Department of Agriculture and Food is currently considering how best to implement a recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board that intramammary antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis should be brought under prescription control. There has been wide consultation on this issue with a view to designing a regime which is sensible and workable for all concerned, while ensuring that public health and animal health and welfare are protected. It is my intention to reach final decisions on this issue at an early date.As regards veterinary vaccines, it was necessary to review all existing licenses which had been issued under outdated legislation. In terms of determining routes of supply in the context of issuing the updated licenses, I again stress that the Department, as competent authority in this instance, does not have a general policy approach to exclude any of the sales categories currently provided for in the legislation. Rather a decision is taken on the basis of the characteristics of the individual product, taking account of the relevant recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board, and the objective criteria specified in the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996.Finally, there is currently under way a fundamental review of the EU legislative framework governing both human and veterinary medicines on the basis of proposals from the European Commission. The proposals contain many positive aspects, not least to improve the availability of treatments which has been acknowledged to be an ongoing problem in the veterinary area generally. The proposals would, for example, be very helpful to the further development of our horse industry. However, we have difficulty with the Commission's proposals to bring all veterinary medicines for food-producing animals under prescription control. In discussions at technical working group level, Ireland has raised the difficulties we see with the proposal, but it is evident at this stage that we do not have majority support for this position, with only three other member states sharing our perspective to some extent. We will, however, continue to press the issue as the package of proposals moves forward through the co-decision process.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	245	In a long and detailed answer, the Minister has not addressed the question everybody is asking, namely whether the Government will bring change in this area. With recent changes in agriculture, farmers dealing with medicines are now very professional and are specialists in every relevant area. I would go so far as to say that some of them are more specialist than some of those left in place to handle the issue. I challenge the Minister to look again at this area.Many young people are now educated in the agricultural area. They have green certificates and otherwise, and are top class dairy and sheep farmers and horse breeders. Why is there such need to introduce this change?
#LiamAylward	unknown-#LiamAylward-party	unknown-#LiamAylward-dob	unknown-#LiamAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Veterinary medicines, including veterinary vaccines, are regulated under comprehensive EU legislation. We must abide by the decisions imposed upon us. There are two distinct areas: the intramammary legislation for the control of mastitis and the three co-operative outlets licensed by the health boards, from where veterinary surgeons supply medicines to their clients, and the pharmacists. The Irish Medicines Board makes the recommendations to the Department of Agriculture and Food.The Department has tried to be practical and to bring in a regime that is acceptable to all. First, we are responsible for public health and, second, for animal health and welfare. Third, we want to bring in a regime that is acceptable to all the stakeholders, particularly the farmer. The Department does not want to impose another cost on farmers if it can be avoided and for that reason we are trying to find a practical solution to the problem.In the area of vaccines, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has control but he has to do that with the recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board. Some 160 to 170 products are currently licensed under the Department of Agriculture and Food and we do not always accept the recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board. In the past, we rejected some 20 out of 60 proposals put forward. While living up to its responsibilities, the Department of Agriculture and Food is also trying to introduce a practical regime here that is acceptable to farmers, which is a concern. I emphasise that the first priority is human public health, followed by animal health and welfare and then cost.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	248	With regard to beef, EU labelling regulations introduced in 2000 require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their product with a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived. For the purpose of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing up to and including retails sale.These labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the Community, regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country and not all the above details are available, that beef must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC" along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.Last year we established an expert group to examine the whole issue of food labelling, including beef and also other meats where EU labelling requirements are not as extensive. In its report, which it presented to us in December 2002, the food labelling group made a number of recommendations relating to the labelling of "origin" as follows: information on the origin of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat pigmeat and poultry meat sold in retail outlets, prepackaged or otherwise, should be declared; information on the origin of the primary meat protein source – beef, sheep meat pigmeat and poultry meat – sold in the food service sector should be provided to the consumer; consumer research should be carried out to establish, first, how origin should be defined in respect of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat pigmeat and poultry meat sold in retail outlets and, second, how origin should be defined in respect of the primary meat protein source – beef, sheep meat pigmeat or poultry meat – sold in the food service sector and, third, the usefulness and effectiveness of the beef labelling regulations from a consumer perspective; and only where an imported food product undergoes substantial transformation in the importing country can the name of the importing country be given as the country of origin on the label or at the point of sale or consumption. To this effect, "substantial transformation" should be clearly defined and harmonised across all EU member states.We have established an inter-agency committee to progress the recommendations contained in this report. The committee comprises of representatives of all Departments involved in food labelling, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board.

Will he agree there is concern among farmers that a great deal of non-EU beef is coming into this country? Can the Minister assure me that such concern is not well-founded and that all the beef is legitimately coming in from the EU? Can he confirm also that the concern expressed by farmers about beef coming in from non-EU countries is not justified? What is the position in that regard? If I buy beef in a factory that is of non-EU origin, can I be assured that the country of origin will be clearly identified? Can the Minister assure Irish consumers and farmers that non-EU products coming into this country are subject to the same production methods as those in the EU? Without going into detail, we often hear that animals are treated badly during the production process. Will the Minister indicate if that is the case? Do these countries have a production system for exports and another for the home market? I would like the Minister to put the issue to bed once and for all and tell us whether our concerns are well-founded.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	250	From all the information available to us from the Department of Agriculture and Food, including to the Minister, those concerns are not well-founded. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has raised those concerns at Council of Ministers meetings, in the Commission and with Commissioner Byrne and Commissioner Fischler. In the reply to the next question I will give the statistical data on imports into this country which I hope will ease people's minds in that regard. We have been assured by the European Commission, in discussions we have had and documentation exchanged, that all the countries supplying the European Union are subject to the same rigorous inspection tests by inspectors within the European Commission vis-à-vis production processes, systems standards, etc., as is the case here. That issue has been raised continuously by the Minister on behalf of this country at various Council and Commission meetings and we are satisfied with the assurances given in that regard.We must understand also that we are part of a global trade network. We export 90% of our beef but we are also subject to WTO agreements, based on which we must import a certain percentage of beef. The amount imported gives us a huge leverage not only in exporting food and beef products but also in getting other products into the greater global marketplace. If we did not have that agreement we could not do our business. There is a condition that WTO beef and food coming in here goes to the catering industry predominantly, which gives us stability in the markets.

There was a wrapper around it indicating it had been produced by a certain meat company here but when she brought it home she discovered from a mark on the tin foil that it was a pork product produced in Belgium. What plans, if any, does the Minister of State have to ensure that when consumers buy products with, say, Treacy's Meats, Ballinasloe or whatever on them, that is what they are getting as opposed to a product from Brussels or elsewhere?

The Minister mentioned whether the labelling should be "non-EU" or the actual country of origin. There is disagreement between the consumer and the trade groups on this issue. The trade groups want only non-EU products but the consumer groups are interested in having the country of origin indicated. Which of those options does the Minister believe is more suitable?

A final conclusion has not been reached on this issue. The best deal for consumers and producers, and for the country as a whole, would be EU product and non-EU product and on that basis we could get the freeflow of product across the different frontiers and into the different markets to the maximum benefit of a primary producer like Ireland.To go back to Deputy Timmins's point, we set up the labelling group. We have now set up an inter-agency committee to implement the recommendations contained in the group's report. We are waiting on the different agencies to come up with final decisions. If the Deputy gives us details of the exact situation in Kilkenny, I am certain my ministerial colleagues will investigate the matter. We will then find out whether the product packaged by the Irish company originated in another country. If a product is imported into the European Union, it should be clearly marked as non-EU.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in respect of imports of meat and meat preparations. The information is compiled on a quarterly basis and supplied to my Department at the end of the following quarter. On the basis of this information, I am in a position to supply to the House statistics, by country, on the quantities of beef imported for the year 2002. For 2003 I have included information for the month of January.While no figure is available for beef imports to Austria for January 2003, it imported 82 tonnes of beef in 2002. Belgium imported 218 tonnes in 2002 and 51 tonnes in January 2003, Germany imported 1,125 tonnes in 2002 and 110 tonnes in January 2003, Denmark imported 248 tonnes in 2002 and two tonnes in January this year, Spain imported four tonnes of beef in 2002 and 19 tonnes in January 2003, France imported 851 tonnes in 2002 and 30 tonnes in January 2003 and Great Britain imported 3,629 tonnes in 2002 and 256 tonnes in January 2003. While no figure is available for beef imports to Greece in 2002, some 12 tonnes were imported in January this year. Ireland imported 110 tonnes of beef last year, no figures are yet available for January of this year. Italy imported 125 tonnes in 2002 and 24 tonnes in January 2003. The figure for 2002 is not available in the case of Luxembourg which imported one tonne of beef in January this year. The Netherlands imported 942 tonnes in 2002 and 78 tonnes in January 2003. No figures are available for Portugal. While no figure is available for imports to Sweden in January, it imported 29 tonnes of beef in 2002. Northern Ireland imported 1,491 tonnes in 2002 and 31 tonnes in January 2003.It should be noted that in certain cases the record of import may include the re-importation of Irish products that were originally the subject of export from this country. The information available for imports from the other member states does not differentiate between imports originating in the European Union and those originating from third countries which may already be in free circulation within the Union.Under the Single Market, there is free circulation of goods within the European Union, but uniform EU-wide controls apply to the production and trade in meat and meat products such as beef. Under EU law, it is a requirement that beef is sourced from an approved establishment, whether a slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold store. It must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or health certificate which bears the identity of the establishment from which the beef has been despatched.Additional information.On a more general point, it should be noted that, under European Union harmonised rules, imports into the EU from third countries must have been sourced in premises and countries approved by the European Commission and are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on imports laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export.The Union labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef at retail level within the Union regardless of whether the beef in question was produced within the Union or in a third country. Where beef is imported from a third country and not all the details I have outlined are available, it must, at a minimum, be labelled as "Origin: non-EC" and the third country in which slaughter took place indicated.

Perhaps I misinterpreted the Minister of State's reply. Did he state that it is possible that imports from other European Union countries may contain beef from non-EU countries? Will he indicate who are the importers of beef here?While attending a meeting in the Minister's neck of the woods, I was berated from the floor on the issue of imports of non-EU beef. I later tabled a parliamentary question and was surprised to discover that 500 or 600 companies and individuals are licensed to import beef. I assume the entities in question would not be licensed unless they were involved in importing beef. Are they co-operatives, meat companies or individuals and companies within the catering industry?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Most of the companies in question are licensed to import and export. However, this does not mean that they all import beef because some of them may export only. The importers include processors and food producers manufacturing various types of food product. The figures I provided cover meat and meat preparations, such as meat mixes and various types of meat which may be pure or a component of the end product. These figures relate to imports by country, rather than imports to Ireland from other countries. A number of companies have no option other than to import certain foods or food preparations from foreign countries in order to complete their products or ensure they are edible, taste properly and are ready for the marketplace. That is the basis on which much of the importation takes place.The position regarding pure meat is governed by World Trade Organisation rules, which allow a number of dedicated companies which must be registered with the European Union and the WTO to import products into this country.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Generally speaking, there is no undue delay in the processing of REPS applications or the issuing of annual REPS payments. Industrial action by clerical staff is affecting the processing of REPS applications in local offices in counties Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Galway and Mayo. Technical grades have recently withdrawn co-operation in respect of temporary transfers in certain grades. Such temporary transfers are used to prevent backlogs in processing applications pending the filling of vacancies. This action is affecting offices in Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Monaghan and Cavan. My Department is arranging to fill the vacancies, which requires that certain procedures are followed. The advertising and processing of these vacancies is taking place and they will be filled without delay.My Department will ensure that farmers will not be penalised for the late receipt of applications resulting from current industrial action. Where possible, farmers who are due to apply for their annual REPS payments should post their applications and obtain a certificate of posting in case a dispute arises. No one will be penalised due to factors outside the control of individual applicants.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	266	It is important that everything possible is done to make REPS amenable as it is a good scheme which should be promoted. However, farmers are losing confidence in it and late payments are part of the reason. How long does it take to issue payments? Some cases appear to take much longer to deal with than others. I do not know the reason for this. What is the average length of time between submission of an application to the Department and the issuing of cheques?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The payment should issue within 14 weeks. REPS is an outstanding scheme and farmers have no excuse not to participate in it. Farmers obligations in terms of the countryside, which we have already discussed, under the scheme should, in any event, be good farming practice. It might interest Members to learn that €1.2 billion has been paid to farmers under the REP scheme to date. Approximately €200 million will be paid this year, a figure which is set to increase in the next two years. A further €1 billion or thereabouts will be paid under the scheme in the next three years.Farmers receive €4,000 or €5,000 and in some cases as much as €8,500 per annum to implement good farming practice. I encourage them to participate in this superb scheme. I want the cost of the REPS plans kept to a minimum. REPS is being reviewed at present. We want to make REPS as simple and straightforward as possible and to take the costs out of it, particularly for smaller farmers. If a small farmer gets €2,500 or €3,000 and has to pay a few hundred euros for the plan, their net amount will be reduced. I want to reduce the complexity involved. There is every reason to encourage farmers to participate more fully. Approximately 37,000 farmers participate in it at present, but we want that to increase to approximately 55,000.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I agree with the Minister's comment that it is a good scheme and that people should be encouraged to participate in it. Many people regard filling out forms as a barrier but that is not the case. Some of the people in REPS II have been asked to go on a course, although they have already completed the same course under REPS I. That makes it more difficult for people. Why are people who have already completed a course in REPS I being asked to do the same course again?
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	269	While I agree that REPS is good for the country from an environmental point of view, almost 2,500 farmers had penalties imposed for non-compliance in 2002. While I appreciate that if someone is non-compliant penalties should be imposed, that figure represents 10% of the total number involved in REPS. That seems a high percentage. Is the system so complicated and difficult for them that they become non-compliant?
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I do not accept that the system is overly complex. It is a good scheme with good amounts of money. Farmers are asked to do what good farmers do anyway in farming. However, I am currently carrying out a full scale review. We have received approximately 55 submissions under that review. The simplification and smooth running of REPS and the reduction in the amount of penalties and costs, particularly for small farmers, will be taken into account. We will then submit it to Brussels to get clearance for the new scheme. We want to see more people involved in the scheme. If up to €1 billion is available in the next three years for a scheme for good farming practices and to enhance the countryside, it is incumbent on all of us and on farm leaders to encourage participation in the scheme.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	271	What about the courses?

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Minister for his reply. However, I am sure he will agree that it has a considerable impact on farming. It behoves us all to take account of the implications of the nitrates directive, regardless of the shape or form in which it might ultimately appear. There are issues which are important, although they may refer directly to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. When the nitrates directive is being applied or agreed, we should consider the issues of human health, the aquatic environment and eutrophication where there could be animal health considerations. Even if they belong officially with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, we should take account of the consequences of what might happen if nitrates are overused or misused even within the nitrates directive.

I ndeireadh na dála caithfear a admháil gurb ar an nGaeilge atáimid ag díriú agus muid ag plé leis an mBille seo.Tá aistriúchán Gaeilge ann ach ní raibh a fhios agam go raibh sé ann go dtí go raibh mé ag caint le duine éigin ar ábhar eile ar fad. Cuireadh cóip Béarla amach do oibrithe agus do dhaoine eile ar fud na tíre. Scaipeadh go forleathan iad agus táim ag glacadh leis gur léadh iad agus ní raibh focal mar gheall ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla ann. Ba mhór an chailliúint í sin chun díospóireacht a spreagadh imeasc an phobail a dhéanfadh an-mhaitheas don Ghaeilge.Nuair a bhíonn aird dhaoine dírithe ar chúrsaí pá nó ar chúrsaí leasa shoisialta, mar shampla, féachann siad ar rud a chosnódh airgead, b'fhéidir. An féidir aird dhaoine a dhíriu ar an mBille seo ar aon tslí is ceart é sin a dhéanamh? Caithfidh an t-Aire glacadh leis nach bhfuil eolas ag an bpobal i gcoitinne ar an mBille seo, fiú amháin san nGaeltacht. Tá reachtaíocht thábhacht os comhair an Tí maidir le stádas na Gaeilge agus níl a fhios an an pobal go bhfuilimid á phlé. Tá an locht sin ar an Rialtas sa mhéid is nár deineadh iarracht díospóireacht a spreagadh nó eolas a chur os comhair an phobail mar gheall ar an mBille. Ní feidir leis an Aire éalú ón fhírinne sin agus caithfidh sé é sin a admháil má tá sé macánta faoin mBille.Tá rudaí maithe ag tarlú i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Tá sé idir lámha ag an bhForas Teanga, mar shampla, foclóir údarásach nua-aimseartha a chur ar fáil. Tá sin ag teastáil le fada. Tá cuid mhaith focal nua tagtha isteach sa teanga ach níl siad le fáil ins na foclóiri. Deirtear go dtógfaidh sé cúig bliana leis an bhfoclóir seo a cur le chéile. Bhéadh sé i bhfad níos fearr don nGaeilge dá gcuirfí níos mó airgid sa bhfeachtas sin agus an foclóir a bheith le fáil chomh luath agus is féidir. Ach tá tús curtha anois ar an scéal sin a leigheas agus sin an rud is tábhachtaí. I ndeireadh na dála nuair a bhíonn tír, comhlucht, Roinn Stáit nó daoine ag iarraidh cuspóir a bhaint amach caithfear a bheith soiléir cad é an cuspóir atá acu. Is cuimhin liom muinteoir a bhí ag múineadh liomsa uair amháin a bhí ar fheabhas ar fad ag múineadh na Gaeilge. Ach, ós rud é nach raibh an timpeallacht ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Ghaeilge nó ag mealladh na daoine óga chun an Ghaeilge a d'fhoghlaim siad ar scoil a úsáid, diag ar ndiag chaill siad a gcuid Gaeilge. Sin an fáth go mbeidh mé ag rá arís agus arís eile go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh díospóireacht ann ar cheist na Gaeilge go hiomlán. Gach lá a théann thart nach bhfuil sé sin ag tarlú tá an scéal ag dul i léig.Tá a lán ag dul leis an mBille seo agus a bhfuil ann ach ní cheart go mbeimid ag cur dallamullóg orainn féin nó ag iarraidh dallamullóg a chur ar dhaoine eile agus ag maíomh go leigheasfaidh an Bille seo ceist na Gaeilge. Tá i bhfad níos mó ag teastáil. I ngach áit a bhfuil airgead á chaitheamh chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt caithfidh go mbeadh cuspóir soiléir agus plean chun an cuspóir sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus an t-airgead ar fáil chun an jab a dhéanamh. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh córas éifeachtach ann chun tomhas a dhéanamh ar cé chomh maith is atá cúrsaí ag dul ar aghaidh nó an fearr aistriú ó shlí amháin go slí eile. Tá an aidhm a chuir an t-Aire os ár gcomhair i bhfad níos laige ná an tír a dhéanamh dhátheangach ach b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé macánta agus gur sin an méid gur féidir a bhaint amach. Níor mhaith liom go gcaillfimis an aidhm straitéiseach eile. B'fhéidir gur leor an aidhm atá leagtha amach ag an Aire don noiméad seo agus go dtiocfaidh an lá nuair a shroichimid an aidhm eile.Muna bhfuil meoin i measc an phobail úinéireacht deimhneathach a bheith acu ar an dteanga agus gur leo é, is beag dul chun cinn a déanfar.

Is cúis áthais dom tacaíocht a thabhairt dó. Tá Bille mar seo ag teastáil le fada an lá agus is fíor chéim ar aghaidh é don Ghaeilge agus do stádas na Gaeilge i gcomhionnannas leis an mBéarla mar theanga oifigiúil.I support the principle behind the Bill. I am happy that people will be enabled to carry out day-to-day business and their principal activities in the Irish language, without the fear of being a figure of curiosity or ridicule.The Bill confirms the equal status of Gaeilge and English as official languages of Ireland. This equal status should extend to the sphere of education. It should be the inalienable right of every student to receive a primary and secondary education in schools of their own choice, whether Gaelscoileanna, Gaelcholáistí or bilingual schools. There appears to be a retreat from this type of educational provision.In my own constituency, a dedicated group of Irish language supporters, Cáirde Ghaelcholáiste Mhuíneacháin, has fulfilled all the necessary criteria for the establishment of an all-Irish post-primary school, and was confidently expecting its official opening to take place in September next. The group had already arranged for a patron, identified a premises and had an assurance of in excess of 30 students to commence their post-primary Irish language education, having graduated from Monaghan's three existing Gaelscoileanna.These were the required criteria prevailing at the time of application in September 2002. The coiste of the proposed Gaelcholáiste satisfied every one of them. The Department of Education and Science has frozen its application, deferring it for at least another year until the school accommodation committee comes up with some ‘revised criteria', as if the existing criteria were not good enough for the existing Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí. Where is the equality in this scenario? Certainly, there does not appear to be much parity or equality of treatment for those worthy people who have campaigned earnestly to have this Gaelcholáiste established.All existing Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí began in precisely the same manner – with a ground-breaking and dedicated group of Irish language enthusiasts who were imbued with a vision, which they succeeded in seeing through to fruition. No doubt, one of the first actions of the proposed official languages commissioner will be to adjudicate upon, and address this situation, which makes a mockery of any concept of a perceived right to a post-primary education through the medium of Irish, not to mention of all the preparatory work and negotiations by the founding coiste of the Gaelcholáiste.This year marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of Raidio na Gaeltachta and the 50th anniversary of the establishment of that great and imaginative Irish language organisation Gael Linn. At the time, dire results were forecast and modest expectations were held out for the success of both these projects. However, they have amply exceeded all expectations, and are now respected and ingrained component parts of the Irish national psyche, as it were.Teilifís na Gaeilge, or as it has subsequently become known, TG4, has been an unqualified success, generating a high standard of Irish programme output, and using the latest modern state-of-the-art communications technology to get its message across, which is, essentially, the promotion of Irish.There is something lacking in the current system of teaching Irish when many young people develop an aversion to the study and learning of Irish and leave primary school with a less than adequate knowledge and a distinct lack of enthusiasm for it. There have been numerous innovative programmes aimed at raising the standard of spoken Irish in schools, including the "Buntús Cainte" method, and the subsequent TV series "Labhair Gaeilge Linn" and "Anois is Arís". All these have apparently failed to significantly raise the standard of spoken and written Irish in schools. This must give cause for serious concern about the future viability of the Irish language.The position vis-à-vis the Bill closely resembles that which obtains in Canada, where English and French are the official languages and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use by all institutions. The Canadian commissioner of official languages acts as a type of languages ombudsman and is the custodian of fundamental linguistic rights. No doubt the Irish official languages commissioner would also address fundamental causes of linguistic deficiencies.Fearaim fíor-chaoin fáilte roimh an mBille seo.

Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh sé seo i bhfeidhm. Gabhamid uilig buíochas le TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta as na seirbhísí an-mhaith ar fad a chuireann siad ar fáil.Tá mé an-bhródúil bheith anseo ag labhairt as Gaeilge agus beidh seans againn as seo amach á labhairt cosúil leis an Bhéarla. Le blianta fada, ní raibh aon tacaíocht don Ghaeilge. Bhí dualgas ar dhaoine freastal ar an Ghaeilge ar scoil agus, mar gheall air sin, bhí an teanga i gcontúirt mar ní raibh dea-mhéin ag daoine don teanga ach anois beidh seans ag daoine í a chothú arís. Déanaim féin iarracht Gaeilge a labhairt.Molaim Údarás na Gaeltachta agus dreamanna mar sin. Bhí muid ag cur geolta ar an fharraige in Acaill agus cionn is go raibh muid ag baint úsáid as an Ghaeilge agus sinn á dhéanamh, thug Údarás na Gaeltachta airgead dúinn leis an obair. Tá suim mór ag daoine óga sna geolta agus nuair a tháinig siad le breithniú ar an obair, chuala siad sinn ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus tugann sin dóibh rud nach raibh acu riamh – seans an Ghaeilge a labhairt fosta. Tá cúpla focal ag gach duine ach tá muid cúthail úsáid a bhaint as. Cuireann rudaí mar seo misneach do dhaoine.Bhí mé ar Oileán Mhanainn cúpla seachtain ó shin agus chuala mé Manainnis ar an raidío. Cé go raibh tionchar an Bhreatnais soiléir, ba léir gur tháinig an teanga sin ón Ghaeilge. Chuir mé ceist ar dhaoine an bhfuil an Mhanainnis beo ar an oileán agus dúirt siad go bhfuil 650 duine atá in ann á labhairt. Tá 80,000 ar an oileán agus tá an teanga ar an raidió. Tá seans againn cuidiú a thabhairt do na daoine sin. Tá áiteanna eile ina bhfuil teanga ach nach bhfuil go leor misneach ag daoine í a labhairt.Cuireann rudaí mar sin dóchas orm agus tá súil agam go tabharfaidh an Bille seo seans do dhaoine atá as cleachtadh snás a chur ar a gcuid. Cuirfidh an Bille fostaíochta ar fáil fosta, le seirbhísí nach raibh ann riamh agus tá sin tábhachtach. Bhí an Stát ag tabhairt béalchrábhaidh don teanga agus seo seans dó sin a cheartú.Ar feadh na blianta bhí rudaí uafasach ag tarlú. Bhí an bata scoir ann agus cuireadh eang sa bhata gach uair a labhair páiste Gaeilge agus ansin bualadh air nó uirthi. Ní mór dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh air sin agus a chuimhniú gur throid daoine go cruaidh ar son na Gaeilge agus le haghaidh seirbhísí i nGaeilge. Molaim an Bille seo.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Díreach mar a bhíonn an dúlra níos boichte agus níos laige má chailltear ainmhí nó planda, bíonn an saol níos boichte agus níos laige má chailltear teanga, mar cailltear luachanna, míniú ar stair an phobail agus go leor eile. Creideann an Comhaontas Glas gur tubaiste as cuimse i stair na nÉireann i gcás formhór na ndaoine cailliúnt na Gaeilge. Creidimid go mbeadh i sochaí eiceolaíoch deireadh leis na forsaí atá tar éis a sheilbh ár ndúchas saibhir idirdhealaithe agus a chosc ar an daonra iomlán. Is cúis imní duine í go bhfuil cap an bháis a bhagairt ar an Ghaeilge ag na forsaí seo.Ag an am céanna, aithnímid go spreagann úsáid na Gaeilge forbairt na féinmhuiníne, nadúr na meithle agus forbairt na crurthaíochta i measc ár muinteartha. Mar gheall air seo, beidh feidhm lárnach ag an Ghaeilge sa reabhlóid éiceolaíoch atá de dhíth orainn. De bharr na cúise seo agus le cearta a chosaint agus maoireacht fhreagracht an domhain, geallaimid an ceart do gach duine áiseanna teagasc na Gaeilge a fháil agus a úsáid.Is gá go mbeadh gach duine in Éirinn in ann a shaol nó a saol nó aon chuid den saol sin a chaitheamh trí Ghaeilge más mian leis nó léi, go mór mór i réimsí riaracháin phoiblí, craolacháin agus oideachais. Anuas ar seo, ní foláir do gach ceantar Gaeltachta bheith saor ó scrios eacnamaíochta agus teanga agus a chúrsaí polaitíochta féin a reachtáil go neamhspleách.Go minic cuirtear an cheist conas is féidir gan ghéilleadh don bhrú Béarla a úsáid. Tuigimid go léir má tá cúigear ag bualadh le chéile in áit ar bith, agus má tá Gaeilge ag ceathrar acu agus Béarla ag duine amháin, deirtear go bhfuil sé drochbhéasach gan Bhéarla a labhairt. Sin cuid den bhrú atá ar lucht na Gaeilge go minic. Sa Chomhaontas Ghlas, aithnímid go bhfuil daoine tar éis dul i ngleic leis an fhadhb seo le teangacha neamfhorleathanacha agus teanga móra lámh le chéile.In Éirinn, tír ina bhfuil teangacha éagsúla á labhairt anois, bheadh teanga neodrach a fhoghlaimítear go furasta úsáideach i dtreo is nach mbeadh míbhuntáiste ar chainteoir teanga amháin i gcomhrá le cainteoirí teanga eile. Tá polasaí ag an Chomhaontas Ghlas a mholann comhpháirtíocht leis na tíortha is boichte ar domhan agus chuirfeadh teanga neodrach ar chumas phobail difriúil labhairt le chéile gan chultúr agus teanga phobail amháin a bheith thíos ar mhaithe le pobal eile atá níos láidre. Sa chomhthéacs sin, is ceart iarracht a dhéanamh Esperanto nó teanga cosúil leis atá neodrach agus furasta a fhoghlaim agus triail a bhaint as. Is fiú sin a chur chun cinn.I gcomhthéacs Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2002, cuirimid fáilte roimh fhoilsiú an Bhille agus tá súil againn go spreagfaidh sé suim i gcúrsaí teangan, i gcúrsaí féinmheasa, i gcúrsaí cultúir agus i gcúrsaí éagsúlachta sa tír seo, ní amháin i measc daoine ach i measc na comhairlí condae agus comhlachtaí príobháideacha agus poiblí. Is cuimhin liom go maith go raibh tráth ann nuair a bhí comhlucht ar nós Toyota as foilsiú fógrái as Gaeilge ar an teilifís. Thuig an comhlucht go raibh suim ag pobal na hÉireann ins an teanga agus cheangail siad í leis na hearraí a bhí á dhíol acu. Tá suim ag daoine a thagann ar cuairt go dtí an tír seo an difríocht a bhaineann leis an tír a fheiceáil, agus tá an teanga mar chuid de sin.Is bun rud é seirbhís Ghaeilge a bheith ar fáil agus is bun chuid den mBille seo é sin. Ach tá sé chomh tábhachtach go mbeadh an Ghaeilge feiceálach, cruinn agus beo ar chomharthaí. Feicim go minic botúin i gcomharthaí ar fud na háite. Caithfear deireadh a chur leis na botúin sin mar cuireann siad olc ar dhaoine agus is léiriú drochmheasa ar an dteanga é. Cur i gcás,chonacthas, "Sráid na Mórcha Ná Lach" i mBaile Átha Cliath ar "Grand Canal Street" i mBéarla. Shílfeadh duine gur Dáithí Lacha a bhí á chomóradh. Chuirfinn deireadh leis an mBéarlachas atá á n-úsáid i gcuid mhór logainmneacha timpeall na tíre. Níl iontu ach Gaeilge truaillithe. Má táimid i ndáiríre mar gheall ar an dteanga, mar gheall ar stair na tíre agus mar gheall ar fhorbairt an phobail ba cheart go dtuigfeadh daoine cad is brí le logainm a n-áit féin. Dá nglacfadh pobal na háite leis an athrú chuirfinn deireadh leis an leagan truaillithe atá ar an áit.Ní chuirfear seirbhísí ar fáil go dtí go mbeidh feabhas mór ar an gcóras ceapacháin ins an Stát Seirbhís. Táimid tar éis dul siar go mór ó thaobh chaighdeáin de. Thuig mé é sin go maith nuair a labhair mé Gaeilge sa Teach seo i mbliain na míle aoise. Dhiúltaigh mé Béarla a úsáid ná a labhairt ar feadh na bliana sin. Bhí an-deacracht ag na státseirbhísigh ag plé leis na ceisteanna pairliminte a chuir mé agus le glaonna teileafóin a rinne mé. Léirigh seo dom go bhfuil jab mór le déanamh ag an Aire agus guím gach rath air. Is cinnte go bhfuil obair mhór le déanamh.Tá gearán déanta ag an Aire mar gheall ar leasaithe atá ró-dhian, ó Chonradh na Gaeilge mar shampla. Tuigim go bhfuil deacrachtaí praiticiúla a bhaineann le cáipéis dlí agus mar sin de ach ní haon dochar na deacrachtaí a phlé agus féachaint cé chomh praiticiúil agus is féidir linn a bheith agus cé chomh idéalach agus is féidir linn a bheith. Ceapaim go bhfuilimid ag dul i dtreo chóras na Breataine Bige, tír atá fós faoi chos ag na Sasanaigh, agus ní i dtreo Cheanada. Ar ndóigh tá banríon acu siúd chomh maith.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Ins an tuairisc atá agam anseo ón Welsh Language Board deirtear:The main factor that contributes to the death of a language is the failure to transfer the language from one generation to the next. To put it simply, for a language to survive parents have to speak it with their children, thus creating a new generation of indigenous speakers.Éinne a bhfuil Gaeilge acu tá súil agam go bhfuil sé sin ar siúl acu sa bhaile mar tá dualgas orainn é a dhéanamh.Ó thaobh chúrsaí oibre de, deir an tuairisc:Welsh helps you get a job. Employment agencies in Cardiff cannot provide enough bilingual secretaries and receptionists. Welsh language media companies cream off the best graduates and insist upon Welsh speaking spokespersons for news bulletins. The arrival of the Welsh Assembly resulted in a shortage of translators. The working Welsh speaking parents want a Welsh speaking nanny for their children.A large number of Welsh people have discovered the value of the language. For some it is a matter of defining who they are, for others it is a matter of ensuring that their children are not deprived in the same way as they were, for others there is an economic advantage in being bilingual and for some it is a matter of belonging to the community that they live in.Bhuail mé le bean in Rath Chairn le déanaí. Cheap mé gur chainteoir ó dhúchas a bhí inti ach bean ó Chicago ab ea í. Tá a fhios aici cé hí agus mé ag déanamh tagairt di ach léiríonn seo gur féidir le daoine teacht anseo agus Gaeilge a fhoghlaim.Beidh an-fhreagracht ar an gcoimisinéir teanga. Sin an dóchas atá sa Bhille seo, go mbeidh coimisinéir againn. Dá bharr sin beidh Gaeilge agus Béarla ar phacáistí ar nós Kelloggs Corn Flakes, b'fhéidir go mbeidh ollscoil Gaeilge againn agus gréasán sóisialta do lucht na Gaeilge. Tá tús maith tógtha ag an Uachtarán atá tar éis Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus molaim í as sin. Aontaím leis an Teachta O'Shea, gur cheart go mbeadh an dualgas ar pháirtithe forógrái a chur ar fáil sa dá theanga. Tá ceann an Chomhaontais Ghlais le fáil, má tá suim ag éinne ann.

Fáiltím roimh aon rud a chuidíonn liom, mar Ghaeilgeoir, mo chearta a bhaint amach. Tá laigí ann, déanadh iad a phlé sa Seanad agus déanfar iad a phlé go mion ar Chéim an Choiste sa Dáil. Mar sin, níl mé chun iad a phlé go doimhin anois.Mar a dúirt an t-Aire, taobh amuigh den mBunreacht níl aon reachtaíocht ann chun cinntiú go gcuirfear seirbhísí ar fáil sa Ghaeilge. Tá an Bille seo á mholadh aige chun an fhaillí sin a leigheas. Rachaidh an Bille bealach éigin chun an fhaillí sin a leigheas ach ní haon panacea é. Is léir ón méid sin cé chomh dona is a caitheadh leis an nGaeilge ó bunaíodh an Stát. Ní gá dul siar chomh fada leis an Chéad Dáil. D'aithin an Chéad Dáil cé chomh luachmhar is a bhí an Ghaeilge mar bhí Aire Gaeilge acu, rud nach raibh againn ó shin. B'fhéidir go mbeimid in ann filleadh air sin amach anseo.Má tá sé mar aidhm fós ag an Stát an Ghaeilge a ath-réimiú caithfimid díriú isteach ar conas is féidir sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé mar aidhm ag páirtí s'againne an Ghaeilge a cur arís i mbéal an phobail agus a bheith mar theanga labhartha ag formhór na ndaoine sa tír. Chun é sin a dhéanamh ní féidir brath ar an mBille seo. Caithfidh an Stát plean straitéiseach a chur i bhfeidhm agus an Bille seo mar chuid de. Ní ann dó faoi láthair agus ní ann dó le tamall fada.Caithfidh an plean straitéiseach díriú isteach ar an oileán ar fad, go háirithe agus Foras na Gaeilge ann. Tá deis againn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar gach uile chuid den oileán seo. Ba chóir don Aire labhairt leis an Rialtas agus impí air iacall a chur ar Rialtas Shasana a leithéid de Bhille a fhoilsiú agus a achtú sa Tionól nuair a thagann sé le chéile arís, ionas go mbeidh Bille teanga againn sa Deisceart agus sa Tuaisceart. Tá leasuithe curtha ag dreamanna éagsúla – beidh ár gcinn féin againn – agus impím ar an Aire díriú isteach orthu agus féachaint go géar ar an tuairim taobh thiar de na leasuithe sin. Ní leasuithe ar son leasuithe iad. Tá i gceist ag na heagrais ar fad agus ag Teachtaí sa Teach seo go mbeidh an Bille seo chomh láidir agus is féidir. Ní fiú é muna dtiocfaidh rud éigin as agus é ina shuí ansin gan bheith curtha i bhfeidhm.Sa dóigh is go mbeidh sé in ann feidhmniú i gceart caithfimid airgead a chur ar fáil. Sin ceann de na príomhrudaí a bheadh mise ar a lorg. Tá gach rud sa Bhille ag brath ar toil an Aire Aireagadais. Is trua an nasc sin a bheith istigh ann. Is féidir nasc a ghlacadh dá mbeadh sé ag brath ar an Rialtas ach ní ar thoil an Aire Airgeadais, go háirithe toil an Aire Airgeadais atá againn nach bhfuil sásta pingin rua a chaitheamh ar aon rud seachas ar na capaill.Luaigh an Teachta Ó Sé níos luaithe go gcaitear a lán airgid ar an Ghaeilge ach ní aontaím leis sin mar níor caitheadh riamh go leor airgid ar an Ghaeilge a athréimniú. Baineann seo le tosaíochtaí – más tosaíocht dár gcuid mar náisiún an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, cuirimis an t-airgead ar fáil. Tiocfadh muid thar aon bhac a bheidh os ár gcomhair má dhéanfar sin.Níl an toil sin léirithe sa Státchóras go dtí seo agus tá an Bille seo dírithe ar an Státchóras – an Státseirbhís, na seirbhísí sláinte agus na cúirteanna. Muna athróidh an toil, ní oibreoidh an Bille. Ba chóir dúinn é a dhéanamh níos daingne agus níos láidre ionas gur féidir le duine dul isteach agus Gaeilge a bheith ar fáil láithreach. Nuair a thiocfaidh duine isteach in aon Roinn Stáit, ba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilgeoir ann, ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach sa tír ar fad. Tá sin sa Bhille ach caithfidh na Ranna sin a chur i bhfeidhm láithreach agus gan bheith in ann a rá go bhfuil scéim ag córas. Caithfear cur leis an scéim gach uile uair a bhíonn athchoimre uirthi fosta.Caithfimid díriú isteach ar an earnáil phríobháideach chomh maith leis an earnáil phoiblí. Ní hí an Státseirbhís a dhéanfaidh an Ghaeilge a athréimniú nó í a thógáil ó aon chruachas ina bhfuil sí, is é an pobal a dhéanfaidh sin. Caithfimid meas a mhuscailt inár muintir féin agus iad a chur arís chun foghlaim na Gaeilge. Níor mhaith linn iachall a chur orthu á dhéanamh ach caithfimid iarracht a dhéanamh iad a mhealladh ionas go mbeidh siad sásta díriú isteach ar an Ghaeilge agus go dtuigeann siad an luach atá léi agus gur cuid lánach dár gcultúr agus stair í.Tá an-fhadhb ann sa Státchóras. Fuair mé trí litir le déanaí ón Státchóras, ceann acu ón General Medical Services Division of the Department of Health and Children. Tá sí go huile is go hiomlán i mBéarla agus tá sin scanallach. Fuair mé dhá litir ón a boird sláinte agus cé go bhfuil aistriú ainmneacha ann, i gcónaí bíonn an Ghaeilge sa dara háit agus bíonn sí beag. Caithfidh an Ghaeilge bheith ar chomhchéim nó chun tosaí – sin an stadas atá ann ag an Ghaeilge sa Bhunreacht – agus ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht.Caithfimid díriú isteach ar na meáin cumarsáide agus a fheiceáil orthu. Dúirt Teachtaí nach mbíonn an méid a deir siad sna nuachtáin nuair a labharann siad Gaeilge. Caithfear athrú meoin a theacht orthu. Sin an dúshlán mór atá romhainn mar phobail ionas go mbeidh toradh ar an obair seo.Tá sé go hiontach an Bille seo a fheiceáil mar bhí mise ar Choiste Ghnó Chonradh na Gaeilge i 1986 agus ag an am sin bhíodh baill foirne ag caint faoi Bhille teanga le deich mbliain. Sa deireadh thiar tá rud éigin os ár gcomhair agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé foirfe agus gur fiú an feitheamh fada a bhí romhainn chun go mbeimid in ann, ar a laghad, an leithéid atá déanta i gCeanada nó sa Bhreatain Bheag a dhéanamh sa tír seo, go mbeimid in ann sampla a thaispeáint do thíortha eile agus go mbeimid chun tosaí le hathbheochan teanga.

Is trua sin.Tá an Ghaeilge i lár an Bhille ach cén fáth go bhfuil sé scríofa? Sa dóigh is go mbeidh gach duine sa tír in ann úsáid a bhaint as Gaeilge, teanga cheart na tíre seo. Tá a lán oibre le déanamh leis na daoine atá cosúil liom féin, daoine aga bhfuil suim acu sa teanga, ach atá imithe ón seomra ranga.Thosaigh mé ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ar scoil agus gach lá bhí rang agam. Léigh mé leabhair agus scríobh mé scéalta faoi mo rothar nua agus a leithéid. Thug mé freagraí don mhúinteoir nuair a chuir sé ceist orm, "Caide a tharla ansin?". Ansin chuaigh mé go Béal Feirsde, rinne mé ceol agus fuair mé teastas múinteoireachta. Ní raibh Gaeilge ar an chúrsa agus ní raibh Gaeilge ag na mic léinn eile. Mar sin, rinne mé dearmad ar an chuid is mo den teanga. Cén fáth? Mar d'éirigh mé as labhairt na Gaeilge nuair a chríochnaigh mé an mheánscoil agus tá an scéal céanna ann d'fhormhór na ndaoine.Le blianta anuas, shíl mé go mbeadh an seans agam cúpla focal a fháil ar ais ach ní raibh an t-am agam nó ní raibh rang ar siúl. Mar sin bhí leithscéal agam agus sin an scéal a bhíonn ag mórán daoine.An bhliain seo caite, áfach, fuair mé post nua – Cathaoirleach i gCoiste na hEalaíne, Spoirt, Tuarasóireachta, Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta – agus tá seans agam mo chuid a fháil ar ais. Tá mise agus a lán Teachtaí eile ar ais ar scoil le ranganna Gaeilge an-mhaith ar fad. Tá mórán againn ag labhairt as Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais. Níl muid líofa ach déanaimid ár ndícheall agus tá suim mhór againn sa teanga agus tugann na ranganna seans eile dúinn. Gabhaim buíochas le gach duine atá ag caint agus ag tabhairt cuidiú dom.Cad chuige a bhfuil mé ag caint fúm féin? Tá an Bille seo dírithe ar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge agus cuirfidh sé an teanga ar ais ar an chlár – gníomh stairiúil. Ba mhaith liom féin mar Éireannach bheith in ann labhairt go líofa i dteanga na tíre agus mo chuid oibre a dhéanamh as Gaeilge nó as Béarla. Gach bliain téann daoine thar lear agus caitheann siad tamall ag foghlaim cupla focal – ein bier bitte, vin rouge s'il vous plaît nó vino blanco por favor. Ní bhaineann siad úsáid, áfach, as a dteanga féin – an Ghaeilge. Chuala mé duine as Madrid ag rá, “Go raibh maith agat” in Dún na nGall nuair a cheannaigh sé pionta Guinness. Ba mhaith liom é a chloisteáil as pobal Dhún na nGall freisin. Níl mé i mo chónai san nGaeltacht – níl Dún na nGall go léir san nGaeltacht – ach tá a lán obair nua le feiceáil tríd an gcontae. Tá naíonraí, Gaelscoileanna agus meanscoileanna ag éirí. Go minic tá sé deacair rud nua a dhéanamh ach sílim go bhfuil sé “cool” anois caint as Gaeilge agus tá suim úr ag tosú, ach níl sé ag críochnú. Thug TG4 saol nua don teanga agus sílim go bhfuil an fhadhb simplí. Fuair muid Gaeilge ar scoil, tá Gaeilge againn ach má bhím féin ag caint as Gaeilge bím ag lorg na bhfocal agus mar sin ní bhíonn mo cheann ag obair comh tapaidh le mo bhéal. Má bhíonn cuid mhór den Ghaeilge timpeall na háite beidh muid in ann cuid mhór Gaeilge a fháil. Tá a Ián ranganna de díth ag na daoine timpeall na tíre atá imithe as an scoil. Tabhair seans dóibh.I do not apologise to those who realise my Irish is not perfect. I am proud to have contributed as much as I did on my own and it was my own script, for all its faults. It is important that those of us with less than perfect Irish are encouraged to contribute. Sometimes one can be unlucky when speaking Irish and encounter someone who is more interested in making sure the grammar is perfect than in getting the gist of the message across. That hinders the spread of Irish.In any country one goes to on holidays, if the person one is speaking to understands one is making an effort, he or she appreciates that effort and helps one. However, the situation I mentioned can be a problem with developing one's Irish. There is a percentage of people who will answer one in English and refuse to speak Irish if they do not understand one. There is only one way to ensure the language develops and that is to have it around one.When I was in university I carried out a study among primary school children and called it Familiarity Breeds Tolerance. I was trying to explain to ten year olds who did not like classical music that it was not all the same. I explained that I hated some classical music and loved other classical music and that it would be the same for them. The familiarity bred tolerance and I played pieces for them they would have heard elsewhere, like "Nessun Dorma" and the music from the Old Spice advertisement. The children thought those were great.We are dealing with a Bill which is trying to make services available through Irish. We are really trying to ensure that the Irish language is there throughout the country, not just in the Gaeltacht, for whoever wants to use it. Ultimately we are trying to give everyone the opportunity to try to express themselves in their native language, which should be Irish, at whatever level they can. When I taught primary schoolchildren music and played it for them over and over, they began to regard it as familiar and accepted it. It is the same with Irish – the more we hear it the more we will accept it and try to use it. If people accept one's Irish is not perfect and allow one to contribute, then one will improve.In the last couple of weeks there has been an astonishing change in the House. I am here seven years and I have heard more Irish in the last fortnight than in the previous seven years put together. People are having fun, which is what Irish should be about, and they can converse in the corridors. We are going in the right direction and we should be positive. I accept the special status of the Gaeltacht and we must preserve what we have there but I am from an area outside the Gaeltacht and we should have the right to speak Irish also.There are many gaelscoileanna, naionra and Irish language schools at different levels trying to get off the ground in Inishowen, where dedicated people are working in this area. There is also good work being done in teaching Irish in mainstream schools. I ask the Minister to look at the protection and support that can be given both to these schools and to adult education. People like ourselves should be able to access support to get us back into the language. TG4 has been a significant influence, while Raidio na Gaeltachta has been operating for many years, in trying to establish Irish as cool and trendy. It is becoming more cool and trendy than it has ever been.Many people come to Ireland to learn English, and that is a significant economic boost to the country. We recently had an intern from America who said the number of people speaking Irish there is phenomenal. Many people would come here to learn Irish and we are not doing enough to promote our language, music and dance in certain parts of the country. This should be examined.I welcome the fact that Deputies O'Shea and Wall are looking at the whole issue of the Irish language and as Cathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I look forward to working with them on our report.I wish the Bill well. The fact that we are talking about the position of Gaeilge within our communities is very important. I hope to come back am éigin eile agus mé líofa sa teanga. Ba mhaith liom cupla focal eile a fháil, ach tús maith leath na hoibre. I hope to go from strength to strength and to succeed in getting Irish from the back of my head to the front.

Maraon léi is cúis áthais agus bróid dom a bheith páirteach ins an ghnó thábhachtach atá idir lámha againn anseo le Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2002. Tréaslaím leis an Aire, Éamon Ó Cuív, leis an iar-Aire Stáit, Mary Coughlan agus le foireann na Roinne as ucht a dea-obair atá déanta acu an reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair. Is Bille suntasach, misniúil, praiticiúil é a bhfuil éileamh air le fada an lá. Táim féin cinnte go dtabharfaidh sé sásamh agus spreagadh do lucht na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sa ghalltacht. Tá sé thar am rud dearfach a dhéanamh mar gheall ar an easpa reachtaíochta i leith na Gaeilge atá ann ó bunaíodh an Stát, agus go háirithe ó ghlacamar le Bunreacht a thug stádas speisialta don Ghaeilge mar phríomh theanga oifigiúil na tíre. Ní fhéadfadh éinne a rá ach go bhfuil meon an phobail i dtaobh na Gaeilge i bhfad níos báúile anois ná ariamh agus dá bharr sin táim den tuairim go bhfáilteofar go forleathan roimh an mBille seo.Is maith is cuimhin liom laethanta m'óige i gCill Dara ar bhunscoil de chuid na mBráithre de la Salle, agus iad a baint úsáid as an mbata chun Buntús Cainte a mhúineadh dúinn. Inniu tá an brú agus an éigeanntacht imithe agus ina n-ionaid tá módhanna nua-aimseartha in úsáid ins na scoileanna a ligeann dos na daltaí taitneamh agus tairfe a bhaint as an teanga. Siar ins na seachtóidí bhí mé imeasc scata déagóirí i mBaile Chill Dara, i gceartlár na galltachta, a chláraigh le hÓgras, óg eagras Chonradh na Gaeilge, a tháinig le chéile go seachtainiúil chun imeachtaí do dhaoine óga a reachtáil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Cuimhním ar an íonadh a chuireamar a mhuintir na háite agus muid ag dul timpeall le chéile a labhairt Gaeilge. Inniu, ní haon rud íontach nó eisceachtúil é comhrá i nGaeilge a chloisteáil i mbialann, nó i dteach tabhairne nó ar an tsráid in aon áit i gContae Chill Dara.Tá anois cúig bhunscoil lán Ghaeilge ag feidhmiú sa chontae, i Léim an Bhradáin, i gCill Choca, i Má Nuad, i Nás na Rí agus ar imeall bhaile Dhroichead Nua, áit a bhfuil Gaelscoil Chill Dara lonnaithe i bhfoirgneamh íontach a cheannaigh an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta anuraidh ó chomhlucht Seapánach a bhí tar éis meánscoil phríobháideach a eagrú ann ar feadh roinnt blianta roimhe sin. Tá fás buacach ag teacht ar na scoileanna seo agus tá iarracht ar siúl faoi láthair bunscoil eile a bhunú i mBaile Átha Í i ndeisceart an chontae. Níl aon amhras orm ach go n-éireoidh leis an iarracht sin chomh maith. Tá níos mó ná 150 gaelscoil timpeall na tíre faoi láthair. Mar a tharla i gCill Dara, tháinig an iarracht agus an fuinneamh agus an díograsacht ar fad chun iad a bhunú ó thuismitheoirí agus i roinnt mhaith cásanna ó thuismitheoirí nach raibh líofacht acu féin sa Ghaeilge. Cruthaíonn seo an bá agus an meas atá ag an phobal go ginearálta don teanga, rud nach raibh riamh chomh soiléir is atá sé anois.Sa chomhthéacs sin, is ceart aitheantas a thabhairt do na heagrais deonacha agus na heagrais Stáit atá freagrach as an dul chun cinn atá déanta – Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Bord na Gaeilge mar a bhí agus anois Foras na Gaeilge. Is fiú aird faoi leith a dhíriú ar a bhfuil déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta le níos mó ná 30 bliain anuas agus le déanaí ag TG4. Feicim mo pháistí féin ag baint taitnimh as cláracha TG4 – d'éirigh leis an stáisiúin na daoine óga a mhealladh. Tá an-chuid déanta ag an chraoltóir náisiúnta chomh maith le dearcadh na ndaoine i leith na Gaeilge a athrú. Bhí an-tionchar ag Éamon de Buitléir le "Amuigh Faoin Spéir", ag Liam Ó Murchú le "Trom agus Éadrom", gan trácht ar bith a dhéanamh ar atá déanta agus atá ag déanamh go fóill ag Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh.Feictear domsa go bhfuil ceithre príomhghnéithe ag baint leis an reachtaíocht seo. Fáiltím roimh altanna 12 agus 13 ina leagtar dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí scéim a ullmhú agus a éisiúint ina dtabharfar sonraí maidir leis na seirbhísí a chuirfidh siad ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. I lár na 1990í bhí mé imo chathaoirleach ar choiste na Gaeilge i gComhairle Chondae Chill Dara. Ar iarratas ó Bhord na Gaeilge chuir muid le chéile plean don Ghaeilge agus leag muid amach spriocanna don chomhairle maidir le Gaeilge a úsáid ag cruinnithe, ar fhoirmeacha, ar fhógraí, ar an ngúthán agus i measc na foirne agus í ag déileáil leis an bpobal. D'éirigh linn roinnt dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ach ar bhealach éigin, tháinig meath ar an iarrach. Cabhróidh an reachtaíocht seo go mór le húdaráis agus le comhlachtaí poiblí an cineál iarracht a rinne muid i gCill Dara a chur i gcrích, ní amháin toisc an fhoráil atá ann in alt 16 maidir le hathbhreithniú tréimhsiúil ar na scéimeanna.Cuirfear fáilte chomh maith roimh na forálacha atá ann in altanna 9 agus 10 ina leagtar dualgas breise ar chomhlachtaí phoiblí féachaint chuige go bhfuil cinnteacht ann gur féidir le daoine teagbháil a dhéanamh leo agus seirbhísí a fháil i gceachtar de na teangacha Gaeilge nó Béarla agus go n-úsáidfear an Ghaeilge ar stáiseanóireacht, ar chomharthaí agus ar fhógraí. Níl amhras orm ach go bhfuil baill foirne ann i ngach údarás agus comhlacht poiblí agus fonn orthu tabhairt faoin obair seo ach an deis agus an spreagadh bheith tugtha dóibh é a dhéanamh.I measc na bhforálacha is tábhachtaí a leagtar síos tá an ceann a bhaineann le húsáid na dteangacha oifigiúla in imeachtaí dlíthiúla agus an ceart a thugann siad don duine éisteacht a fháil sa teanga oifigiúil is rogha leis nó léi. Is moladh den scoth é bunadh oifig choimisinéar na dteangacha oifigiúla mar, gan amhras agus in ainneoin an dea-thoil atá ann don Ghaeilge, beidh gá le maoirseacht agus le monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an Acht chun féachaint chuige go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm é go forleathan san earnáil phoiblí.This is a well crafted and balanced Bill which will fill the legislative void that has existed in relation to our languages since the enactment of our Constitution. Therefore, to coin a phrase, it is a far better thing we do than we have ever done before. Molaim an Bille don Teach.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am a slightly unusual contributor to this debate in that I do not feel confident enough to proceed in conversational Irish but I was anxious to speak for a number of reasons which I will outline. I compliment the Minister as someone who clearly has the Irish language at heart and who genuinely wants more people to speak it and to see it at the centre of what it is to be Irish. As was said by the last speaker, this is the first legislation since the enactment of the Constitution to legally recognise and enforce equality of language among the two official languages recognised in the Constitution. The first official language is Irish, or Gaeilge, and the second is English, or BéarlaIn relation to official languages in the Constitution, I would like to put down a marker by saying I believe there should be a third language, that is, Irish sign language, a topic to which I will come back towards the end of my contribution. Clearly, the main element which I wish to support in relation to this legislation is the promotion of the Irish language. The establishment of the Office of Language Commissioner is necessary and I welcome the fact that the commissioner will be appointed by the President and not the Minister. That is a sensible, non-political step, particularly when it comes to enforcing elements of the Constitution which is a presidential role. The definition of two official languages receives legal recognition which is welcome. The Bill provides that we, in the Oireachtas, lead by example in that the use of Gaeilge or Béarla is officially recognised and acceptable. Money will be spent on the necessary practicalities surrounding that. The publication of Acts and Bills will receive the same treatment which is welcome.If we are to preach about use and the promotion of the Irish language, we must lead by example and that seems to be happening in an effective way in this legislation. The legislation extends outside this House to other public bodies, and I will come back to some successful schemes in county council areas which the Minister should support.There are no Gaeltacht areas in my constituency but there is a number of gaelscoileanna. The gaelscoileanna movement, which is a genuine one, is evidence of the fact that even people who do not speak Irish at any level or who, like me, would not be confident enough to put into practice their leaving certificate Irish, send their children to gaelscoileanna for their education. As the Minister outlined in his speech – I was glad to hear it – it is proof of the fact that even for people who do not speak Irish, the Irish language means a lot to them as Irish people because it is seen as part of our culture in the same way as Irish music and other traditional aspects of Irish life are, but the Irish language is even more important than those other elements. As someone who does not have fluent Irish, I recognise that. If, or when, I have children in the future, I will consider sending them to a gaelscoil so I hope they would not be in a similar position to that which I am in now in terms of wanting to contribute as Gaeilge but not having the confidence to do so.While I am on the topic of education, if we are serious about the promotion of the Irish language for the masses, we must re-evaluate how Irish is taught in schools. It is extraordinary that although Irish is compulsory and is taught in primary and secondary schools, many people who study French for the leaving certificate and who may only start to study it in third or fourth year find that their conversational French is of a higher standard than their conversational Irish when they leave school. Although Irish is compulsory and is taught at both primary and secondary school, it is extraordinary that many people who study French for the leaving certificate, who may only have started studying it in third or fourth year, find that their conversational French is of a higher standard than their conversational Irish. We should be encouraging people to use Irish for conversation rather than perfecting grammar. We need to re-evaluate the way in which Irish is taught. I feel strongly about that and am supportive of keeping Irish as a compulsory part of education. However, we should debate it and people should not be accused of being unpatriotic if they have a different opinion, which, unfortunately, sometimes occurs.We need to examine how to get rid of the embarrassment factor. The irony is that people who believe more passionately that we should be promoting the Irish language are often the people who are terribly dismissive of people who have a small amount of conversational Irish and attempt to use it. We have made progress in this area. Eight or ten years ago, the embarrassment factor meant that people who were not fluent as Gaeilge would not even attempt to speak for fear of being cut down to size. It is important to recognise that is much less the case now and people who are living in Gaeltacht areas, those who speak as Gaeilge at home, are now far more appreciative when people make an effort to speak half and half, almost in pidgin Irish. That is something which the Minister needs to take a lead on and encourage, particularly because he has considerable credibility among the Irish-speaking population.I, too, recognise the work Deputy O'Dowd has done, as a member of Fine Gael, in trying to reach out to Gaeltacht areas. He has spent much time in them and I know he will continue to do so. Wearing my broadcasting hat, because my responsibilities in Fine Gael concern communications, marine and natural resources, I note that there should be a continued role for TG4. Some cynics say it is a waste of time but I challenge that view. While I remain the Fine Gael spokesperson on communications and broadcasting, we will support the continued existence and funding of TG4, and the same applies to Raidio na Gaeltachta. I say this because TG4 in particular promotes the kind of conversational Irish that I can attempt to buy into as opposed to the heavy, grammatical Irish that would simply turn me off if I tried to apply myself to it.I congratulate the Minister on the Bill, which I welcome. It will receive support from all parties but I encourage him to take it further and lead by example in respect of the points I have made, particularly in the education field. If we are making Irish compulsory in schools, which is the correct decision, children need to look forward to Irish class. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case in many schools.I do not know of any other speaker who raised the issue of Irish sign language, about which I feel strongly. Under an official languages Bill we should be addressing this. People may dismiss it as a niche element of Irish society but I hope the figures will persuade the Minister that it is important. The number of people in Ireland with severe hearing loss, many of whom rely on Irish sign language, is 19,026. The number of profoundly deaf people, who either need to lip read or use sign language, is 4,933. Therefore, there are approximately 25,000 people concerned, which is significant when one considers the number living in Gaeltacht areas.In Britain, British sign language has recently been recognised as an official language. We should follow that example and look at ways in which we can officially recognise Irish sign language. French, US, British and Irish sign languages are different and the latter is not connected with spoken Béarla or Gaeilge. It is a separate way of communicating, it has been in existence for many decades and deserves official recognition in the Constitution. Obviously, that is not possible in the legislation under discussion but I will attempt to table amendments that reflect my view. Will the Minister examine my proposal to see if it is possible? Irish sign language is the first language of deaf people, who are citizens just like everybody else, and, as such, they deserve to have it recognised.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Tá beagán Gaeilge agam. Táim ag déanamh cúrsa Gaeilge faoi láthair agus tá súil agam go mbeidh mé i bhfad níos fearr. Labhróidh mé as Béarla an tráthnóna seoI welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, the purpose of which is to promote equality for the Irish and English languages, the official languages of the State. Crucially, it also attempts to facilitate the language rights of a citizen in his or her dealings with the State.Encouraging increased use of the Irish language in all areas of public life is an important development, which must be expanded and built upon. The Bill aspires to do this. There can be no argument that it is not worthwhile and it is long overdue. The Bill may represent the beginning of the end of paying lip service to the Irish language.I welcomed the contribution of my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd. Last year, I attended an Irish conference in Dingle with the Deputy, which I found very interesting. We visited the ordinary people of the Gaeltacht and he spoke through Irish. It was there that my love for the Irish language was inspired.As a country, we have a great history of talking about the language, raising it to an exalted status and aspiring to return it to its former glory. Unfortunately, we also have a history of doing nothing and using failed methods to drill the language into young people and failing to show a good example in its use. I am grateful that it was a Fine Gael-led Government that began to recognise the role of the Irish language in modern Ireland. When Teilifís na Gaeilge, now TG4, was set up, Fine Gael and our partners in Government, the Labour Party, were castigated by many outside the House for throwing good money after bad. It is good to see that they have now been proven wrong.I commend my former colleague from Clare, Donal Carey, who was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, for his work in respect of the Irish language and the islands. However, it is sad that we are debating this Bill against the background of Government cutbacks at every level of education. There is little point in promoting the use of the language in the House and by other public agencies, when children have to learn in a poorly-funded learning environment.That is a matter for another time but it should remain in the minds of Ministers as we give them our support this evening. I commend the Minister in his role as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for promoting the Irish language at every opportunity. He has been to Clare on many occasions regarding the CLÁR programme and he has promoted the Irish language at several functions which I attended. It would be useful if the Government at some stage gave a Minister of State responsibility for promoting the language.The debate this afternoon takes place against the background of a change in the use of the language. This is highly relevant to the Bill because we increasingly see anglicised versions or abbreviations of Irish words and place names in text books, on road signs and in everyday use. For instance, in the Minister's constituency with which I am familiar, the town of Gort, which was always known as Gort Inse Guaire, is now called An Gort. The same is true of Lahinch in County Clare which used to be known as Leacht Uí Chonchúir and is now known as An Leacht. It is a mistake to change these names because by doing so we are losing our history. Even in children's text books one reads the word "zú" which should be gairdín na h-ainmhithe. We lose the meaning of the language if we modernise these words. I hope that by encouraging the use of the Irish language in an official capacity we may go some way towards ensuring that this practice does not continue. Just as the French had a battle with the creeping anglicisation of their language, so do we face an even greater challenge within the context of a multicultural society, an enlarged Europe and a globalised economy.I would like to highlight a few points in the Bill. I welcome the fact that section 2, in defining the official languages, meets our constitutional commitments by giving primacy to the Irish language as the first official language and the national language, while recognising English as the second official language, as set out in Article 8 of the Constitution.Section 5 provides for the use of the official language in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I encourage this development as it is fitting that these Houses, which form one of the most important institutions in the State should lead the way in the promotion of the Irish language, in recognising its importance and forming an integral part of the Irish identity. For this reason I welcome the fact that the training unit of the Oireachtas is running Irish courses for the Members. I am facilitating that and doing one of the courses. I have been to one session and enjoyed it very much. In the next few months I hope to be in a position to speak some Irish at functions and maybe in this Chamber as well.In this regard placing on a statutory basis the publication of Acts in Irish and English sets a good precedent in the recognition and granting of a clearly defined role for the Irish language in society. I hope that this development will lead to increased use of the language in both Houses of the Oireachtas, even among those who are not as fluent as other Members. The use of the Irish language must be facilitated and encouraged among those people with the cúpla focail. One hopes that this legislation will result in the diffusion of the language into all aspects of the State services and public life, granting a person the right to communicate and receive services from a public body in either of the official languages, coupled with the right to have legal proceedings heard in his or her preferred official language, affording choice to some individuals. Clare County Council is trying to set up an oifig Gaeilge, and the SPC committee is trying to speed up that process so that business can be transacted as Gaeilge.I welcome the Bill. Tá teanga na Gaeilge an-tábhachtach dár n-oidhreacht. I hope it expands the use of our national language and enriches us all.

Tá áthas orm seans a fháil tacaíocht a thabhairt don Aire leis an obair atá idir láimhe aige chun na teanga Gaeilge a chothú mar theanga oifigiúil agus í a thabhairt chun cinn níos mó ná mar atá sí.Níl aon dabht ann le blianta anuas go bhfuil ár dteanga ag dul i laige. B'fhéidir nuair a bhíonn an tír ag dul ar aghaidh agus nuair atá tuilleadh airgid ag daoine nach dtugfar an t-aitheantas céanna don teanga. Is teanga í a úsáidtear go foirmiúil i ngnóthaí oifigiúla agus seirbhísí poiblí áirithe.Is cailliúnt mhór í d'aon tír a teanga dúchais féin a chailliúnt. Tá seanfhocal ann – tír gan teanga, tír gan anam. Tá an Ghaeilge riachtanach dár gcultúr, dár neamhspleáchas agus dár n-aitheantas. Aon tír nach bhfuil á húsáid go oifigiúil, tá an chontúirt ann go gcaillfear ar fad í. Má thugaimid ár gcúl don teanga, caillfear í. I láthair na huaire tá easpa seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge agus tá geárghá chun na faidhbe seo a leasú. Tá Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2002 chun na faidhbe seo a cheartú.Tá roinnt rudaí an-tábhachtacha sa Bhille. Tá na seirbhísí Gaeilge i gcomhlachtaí poiblí an-tábhachtach. Beidh aitheantas ar an teanga oifigiúil, úsáid an teanga oifigiúil in Achtanna, agus an ceart ag daoine a gcás a phlé sa teanga oifigiúil is rogha leis nó léi roimh na cúirteanna. Beidh duine in ann freagra a fháil trí Ghaeilge más mian leis ó aon chomhlacht phoiblí i gcomhfhreagras a bheidh aige nó aici, is cuma an trí phost leictreonach nó litir scríofa é. Beidh comhsheasamh ag an Ghaeilge leis an Bhéarla ar fhoirmeacha, ar fhógraí agus ar chomharthaí i gcomhlachtaí poiblí agus beidh dualgasaí ar na comhlachtaí sin tuairisc bhliantúil a fhoilsiú sa dá theanga oifigiúla. Tá mise ar lorg seo leis na blianta fada mar ní raibh comhlachtaí Stáit ag cur amach doiciméid sa dá theanga. Caithfidh oifig Stáit atá ag cur doiciméid amach é a dhéanamh sa dátheanga. Beidh sé de chabhair do dhaoine iad a fhreagairt trí Ghaeilge mar tugann sé tacaíocht dóibh chun na Gaeilge a úsáid mas mian leo sin. Sin mar ba cheart dó a bheith. Sin mar a bhíodh sé. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire, Éamon Ó Cuív, ag déanamh a dhícheall chun an teanga a chur chun cinn ó tháinig sé isteach. Tá sé soléir, ón tslí ina bhfuil sé ag obair ins an Roinn, go bhfuil sé ag déanamh dul chun cinn maith ann. Tá aithne agam air leis na blianta anuas agus ar a thuismitheoirí agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé díograiseach leis an teanga Gaoluinne a spreagadh, agus tá dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh aige, mar a dúirt.Nuair a rabhas ar scoil, ní raibh focal Béarla le cloisint timpeall an chlóis ag na leanaí, agus dá mbeadh féin, ní tharlódh sé ró-mhinic mar Gaoluinn ar fad a bhí á labhairt ann, agus aon chlann a tháinig isteach ins na scoileanna a raibh Béarla ag na tuismitheoirí, ní rabhadar i bhfad in aon chor ag foghlaim na Gaoluinne. Samhlaím féin go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine ag taisteal, go bhfuil mórán bualadh le chéile ag tuismitheoirí agus daoine ag teacht isteach ón ngalltacht go dtí na Gaeltachtaí. B'fhéidir gur sin an fáth a bhfuil sé ag tarlú.Molaim an obair atá déanta ag an Aire ó ceapadh é, agus níl aon dabht ar domhan ach go mbeidh sé ag tabhairt na Gaoluinne chun cinn annso.

I wish I could say more than that. I remember when I came to the Dáil a year ago, I said that one of my ambitions was to address it as Gaeilge. That is important, and I always admire Deputies who can do that.During the week I was remembering back a little about my schooldays, which were a long time ago. Strangely enough, I went to school locally in Clarendon Street, then in the convent on Crumlin Road and then the Christian Brothers' school in Synge Street and Drimnagh Castle. My reports, some of which have survived in my sister's home, state that I was apparently very good at Irish and coped with it very well. It upsets me that I did not persist with it, and one of the things that I have done, with other Deputies, is sign on for Irish classes. It is important that we do so. I welcome the Bill. It is important to acknowledge that such occasions – I know that there is controversy about these late or extended sittings – give us an opportunity to deal with important legislation, and that is what we are doing this evening.In reflecting on the business before us, something occurred to me. I live in St Mark's parish in Springfield in Tallaght, and the presence of Deputy Dinny McGinley reminds me that our parish priest, Fr. Frank Herron, is currently resting in Donegal. I mention him because when he came to our parish a short time ago, he discovered, as I have recently, that there are 50 different nationalities living there, which is an amazing statistic. He told us at Mass one morning that some of them had met him and apologised because English was not their first language. He told them that that was no problem, since it was not his either.That set me thinking. We all use English in our business. The presence of so many foreign nationals in our communities – we watch and are impressed by the manner in which they are not afraid to promote their own culture and language – reminds us of our obligation. Though I am sorry that I cannot do so as Gaeilge, I have no hesitation in saying that it is important that we work on that ideal. We must understand that in this new century, it is still our responsibility to promote Irish, Irish culture and all things Irish – for that, by the way, is what we are. Just like our foreign friends, we should be proud of our traditions and heritage.I am glad that my admiration for the Minister is universal, being shared by the Opposition too. Not only does he do a good job and reach out to our communities – coming to Tallaght as often as to Clare and everywhere else, something of which I am very glad – but he works at the language. He is the perfect example of a family and community man who is prepared to promote the Irish language, Irish culture and everything Irish. We can follow that example, and I am very happy to do so. Some Members will know that Tamhlacht, or Tallaght, has a huge tradition of Irish culture. We have two all-Irish first level schools, Scoil Chaitlín Maude in Killinarden and Scoil Santain in Avonmore Road, where one of my sons went to school. There are another two schools, one from Knocklyon and Scoil Mológa in Inchicore, which feed into the 250-pupil 18-teacher school, Coláiste de hÍde, which in recent years has moved from Old Bawn Road, where it was for some years, to a brand new, excellent facility in Tymon Park.The work of the school in promoting the language among families, not only the families of those attending the school, but also in the general community, is something of which I am very proud. Deputy McGinley will know that one of the vice-principals in that school is, while one of my constituents, originally from his constituency.

I am making the serious point that the all-Irish schools in Tallaght, both the second level school and the two primary schools, do a tremendous amount of work and promote Irish language and culture. That is something which we all desire.I am also happy to say that South Dublin County Council, which was established by the Government under the Local Government Act 1994, has been active in promoting the language. However, as with every other authority, Members must keep them on their toes as far as that is concerned. I have strong views about the local authority's role. I believe that it has a big part to play, and at that level we have tried to ensure that when people call to the modern offices in Tallaght, if they so wish, their business can be transacted as Gaeilge. We have also adopted a policy on bilingual signs, attempting to ensure that developers use both versions. It is very important that we do so.I am certainly very proud of what has been done in my town and the other population centres represented – Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue – where there is support for Irish language and culture. We should all take the opportunity to promote that ideal as much and as often as possible, and I hope that we can continue to do so. As I said, I hope, through the Irish classes that I and other Members are attending, that appreciation of the language will increase here in the House. I believe that up to 90 Members are now attending, and that is very important. The Minister would undoubtedly want to promote and acknowledge that. I am sure there will be an occasion when we can dance and sing as Gaeilge and show some example.The Official Languages Bill, which has already been passed by our colleagues in the Seanad is now in this House. It is important to acknowledge that it is the first legislation to provide a statutory framework for the delivery of services through the Irish language and that the Bill specifies some basic general provisions of universal applicability. For example, correspondence is to be replied to in the language in which it is written and there will be bilingual publication of certain key documents and use of Irish in the courts and other bodies which are not tied to schemes.Among the principal provisions of the Bill are measures to provide for the publication of Acts simultaneously in both languages and the use of the official language in legal proceedings. A person will have a right to be heard in the official language of his or her choice, which is important. It will be a duty of public bodies to prepare a statutory scheme detailing the services which will be provided through the medium of Irish, English or Irish and English.The measures to be adopted under this Bill ensure that any services not provided by the body through the medium of the Irish language will be so provided with a timeframe to be agreed, in effect, distinguishing between services to be provided in the lifetime of the current scheme and those to be addressed in a longer timeframe. I also welcome the duty of public bodies to ensure that the official language is used on stationery, signage and advertisements, in accordance with the regulations to be made by the Minister, and that certain documents of public interest, policy proposals or annual reports should be published in each of the official languages simultaneously.Regarding the establishment of the office of the Official Languages Commissioner, the commissioner will be independent in the performance of his or her duty and will be appointed by Úachtaráin na hÉireann. The Bill assigns general responsibility to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in regard to ensuring the delivery of State services through Irish.Though I lament that my knowledge of Irish is somewhat rusty, I find that when I am in the Oireachtas canteen or around the Houses, and even when I am speaking to the Minister – I am a little overawed when I do that – I am able to speak some Irish. At my age, it is about trying to drag it up. It is important that we have an interest in and not be afraid to promote the language or stand in Dáil Éireann, as other colleagues have done, to make a speech about the importance of the Irish language as Béarla. It is a good sign that Members have done that.I draw attention to the manner in which the various foreign nationals who have now joined our communities are not prepared to allow their languages and cultures to lapse. We should be just as proud and anxious to promote our language. It would be good if colleagues around the Houses could help me and others with our use of Irish.I told Deputy O'Dowd that I was fascinated with his breakfast time appearance on RTE television last week with Deputies Cowley and Ó Snodaigh, though I was also fascinated by the time of day of the appearance. Having that kind of conversation and interaction is of help to those of us who are anxious to bring the language back to our own vocabulary. I look forward to a day when I can stand in the House – I will try to do it in my first term – and make a speech as Gaeilge, and still mention Tallaght as many times as I must.

Tá sé tamall fada ar an bhealach ach is cinnte gur fearr go mall ná go breá, mar a deir an seanfhocal. Ní raibh mé istigh i rith an lae ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht ach an méid ar chuala mé nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht i m'oifig, chuir sé gliondar ar mo chroí gur chuir gach duine fáilte roimh an Bhille agus gur labhair siad i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Ceann de na rudaí a chuaigh i bhfeidhm go mór orm nó na daoine a labhair i mBéarla, go raibh dea-mhéin agus dea-thoil acu agus go raibh siad deimhneach fán Bhille, Ní raibh aon dhiúltachas ann agus bhí dea-mhéin ag teacht amach frid a gcuid cainte i mBéarla don teanga. Déanaim tagairt do na daoine a labhair romham – an Teachta Simon Coveney, a dúirt nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge aige ach a chreideann go daingean i gcearta na Gaeilge, an Teachta Pat Breen, an Teachta Ó Cnochúir a labhair óna chroí agus ár n-urlarbhraí féin, an Teachta Fergus O'Dowd. Ní chainteoirí dúchais iad agus tá sé iontach go bhfuil daoine nach gcainteoirí dúchais iad agus nach raibh deis acu an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ón chliabhán cosúil leis an chuid eile againn ábalta teacht amach agus labhairt chomh deimhneach sin agus tacaíocht mar seo a thabhairt don Bhille.Tá Billí den chineál seo ag tíortha eile ach is cuimhin liom cúpla bliain ó sin nuair a bhí comhchoiste na Gaeilge ar bun, thug muid cuairt ar Cheanada. Ní chuimhin liom an raibh an tAire linn, b'fhéidir gurbh é a mhol dúinn a dhul ann.

I Quebec agus na cúigí eile chuaigh sé i bhfeidhm go mór orainn, bhí an Teachta Ó Sé linn, nuair a bhí an dá theanga le feiceáil go soiléir in achan gné den saol – duine ag plé leis an earnáil phríobháideach nó earnáil phoiblí, tá an dá theanga ansin dó – an Bearla agus an Fhraincís, gualainn ar ghualainn agus tá a fhios ag duine go bhfuil an bheirt acu ar fáil.Is dócha go bhfuil tionchar ag an Bhille a cuireadh i bhfeidhm ansin ar chúrsaí teangan ansin anois. Tá mé cinnte nuair a bhí an Bille seo á dhréachtú ag an Aire agus ag an Roinn, go ndéarna siad staidéar speisialta ar mar atá cúrsaí i gCeanada.Mar a dúirt an tAire féin, bhí sé de phribhléid againn bheith ina chuideachta an bhliain a thug muid cuairt ar an Bhreatain Bheag. Tá Bille cearta teangan acusan ansin chomh maith agus tá ag éirigh go maith leis. Tá súil agam go ndéarnadh staidéar ar an cheann sin, gur féidir linn foghlaim ón dul chun cinn atá déanta ansin agus foghlaim ós na botúin atá déanta acu. Tá súil agam gur mar seo an cás sa Bhille seo.Deirtear liom go bhfuil an Bille seo ag dul a thabhairt seasamh reachtúil don teanga. Tá seasamh bunreachtúil ag an teanga ó 1937, sí an chéad teanga oifigiúil í. Is millteánach an rud é gur ghlac sé chomh fada sin seasamh reachtúil a thabhairt don Ghaeilge mar an chéad teanga oifigiúil.Tá trí ré gur fios dom féin i saol na Gaeilge. Sa bhliain 1893 a bunaíodh Conradh na Gaeilge. Bhí sé ina ghluaiseacht mhór ar fud na tíre ag an am sin agus bhí gach aicme, dream agus creideamh páirteach ann. Tharla rud suimiúil bliain ó shin. Ní ró-mhinic a bhímse in Áras an Uachtaráin. Ní hionann sin agus an t-Aire. Is dócha gur saolaíodh ansin é, beagnach. Bhí mé in Áras an Uachtaráin ar chuireadh ón a Soilse, an t-Uachtarán. An dream go léir a bhí ann an oíche sin ba as Tuaisceart Éireann iad agus, níos íontaí ná sin, is dócha gur aontachtóiri ab ea an t-iomlán acu. Chuir mé mé féin in aithne don fhear a bhí ina shuí in aice liom agus chuir mé ceist air cad ab ainm dó. Dúirt sé "Christopher Brooke". Fuair mé amach gurb é an seanathair a bhí aige ná Lord Brookeborough. Tar éis tamaill chuir sé ceist orm, an raibh aon fhocal Gaeilge agam agus dúirt mé go raibh cupla focal Gaeilge agam. Bhí pictiúir na n-Uachtarán uilig thart ar na ballaí, agus seanathair an Aire san áireamh, agus taispeánadh dúinn pictúir de Dhubhglas de hÍde, an Chraoibhinn Aoibhinn, mac le ministéir de chuid Eaglais na hÉireann, agus an fear a chuir Conradh na Gaeilge ar bun. Chuaigh muid thart ar an chuid eile agus dúirt an t-Uasal Brooke, "Ar chuala tú iomra ariamh ar Rose Maud Younge?". Níor chuala mé, leis an fhírinne a rá, iomrá uirthi ach chuala mé iomra ar Róise Ní Ógáin, an bhean a chuir an duanaire Gaeilge le chéile. Dúirt sé liom, "Ba í sin mo shean aintín, agus tá mise i mo chonái anois ins an chaisleán a bhí aici-se, an Caisleán Geal Gorm, i gContae Aontrama, i mbaile an-Ghaelach, an Baile Meánach".Dúirt sé liom gur tháinig Foras na Gaeilge chuige anuraidh agus dúirt gur mhaith leo an leabhar seo a chur in ath-chló agus cuireadh a thabhairt don Athair Denis Faul a theacht agus é a sheoladh. Ar ndóigh, ní raibh mórán aithne ag Christopher Brooke ar Denis Faul ach, mar sin féin, tháinig sé agus rinne sé an jab agus bhí comhrá íontach acu ina dhiaidh sin. Dúirt Christopher Brooke go raibh Denis Faul ar cheann des na cairde is fearr dá bhfuil aige anois. Is é an fáth go bhfuil mé ag insint an scéil sin go léiríonn sé níos fearr ná sampla ar bith eile an feachtas agus an comh-oibriú a bhí imeasc gach dream ins an am sin agus bhí sé sin ag dul ar aghaidh. Déanadh botún ag Ard Fheis Chonradh na Gaeilge éigin ag tús an chéid seo caite nuair a tugadh cúrsaí polaitíochta isteach i ngluaiseacht na Gaeilge agus scoilt sí. Nuair a bunaíodh ár Rialtas féin i 1922 leagadh síos polasaí na hathbheochana agus cuireadh gluais leis sin i 1937. Nuair a dhearcaimid siar deirimid linn féin, "Cad é an dul chun cinn atá déanta? An bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt ins an tír nó ins na Gaeltachtaí inniu ná mar a bhí nuair a bunaíodh an Stát nó in 1893?". Is cinnte go bhfuil níos lú Gaeilge á labhairt ins an tír inniu ná mar a bhí in 1893, cibé fá 1922 nó 1923.Nuair a bheidh an Bille seo reachtaithe agus an coimisinéir ceapaithe agus i mbun a dhualgaisí, cad a dhéanfaidh sé do labhairt na Gaeilge agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ins an tír? Tá súil agam go mbeimid uilig anseo i gceann ceithre nó cúig bliana eile agus in ann dearcadh siar ar an lá inniu agus a rá linn féin gurb fhiú é a dhéanamh. Chuireamar freagracht na hathbheochana ar an gcóras oideachais agus ar na múinteoirí. Bhíomar inár suí anseo ag déanamh na rialacha agus d'fhág muid faoi na múinteoirí agus faoin gcóras oideachais iad a chur i bhfeidhm. Ba mhór an jab é sin. Rinne na múinteoirí agus an córas oideachais go leor ar feadh na mblianta ach níl duine ar bith nach gcreideann go bhfuil athrú mór tar éis teacht ar an nGaeilge i gcúrsaí oideachais.Tá rudaí fiúntacha tar éis tarlú. Luadh na Gaelscoileanna agus sin ceann des na comharthaí dóchais is mó atá againn. Tá na mílte buachaillí agus cailíní ar fud na tíre taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht ag déanamh a gcuid oideachais trí Ghaeilge. Beidh siadsan ina gcainteoirí líofa nuair a bhéas an scolaíocht críochnaithe acu. Bhí daoine ins an Teach a chuaigh tríd na Gaelscoileanna roimhe seo. Cuimhním ar dhaoine cosúil le Alan Dukes, a raibh Gaeilge ar a thoil aige a bhí chomh maith le cainteoir dhúchais ar bith. Níl cás na Gaeilge chomh maith ins na gnáth-bhunscoileanna. Tá titim mhór ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge ansin. Is cinnte go n-aontaíonn an t-Aire liom ar an bpointe sin. Luadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin a cuireadh ar bun ins an fichidí agus a rinne cinnte go raibh múinteoirí á gcur ar fáil, bliain i ndiaidh bliana a raibh Gaeilge líofa acu. Cuireadh deireadh leis na coláisí sin agus tá an rian sin le feiceáil ó shin ar chaighdeán Gaeilge na mbunscol.Tá comharthaí dóchais eile ann. Deineadh tagairt don obair atá á dhéanamh ag TG4. Síleann daoine óga anois gur rud taitneamhach an Ghaeilge. Mar a dúirt an Teachta Coveney, tá súil againn go dtiocfaidh an lá go mbeidh na daltaí ins na scoltacha ag fanacht leis an rang Gaeilge in ionad eagla agus doicheall bheith orthu faoi, mar a bhí san am a chuaigh thart. Nuair a thiocfaidh an lá go mbeidh fonn ar pháistí dul isteach ins an rang Gaeilge beidh dul chun cinn mór déanta.Tá Raidió na Gaeltachta molta dá mbeinnse i mo thost. Tá sé le fáil ar fud na tíre agus ar fud an domhain. Freastalann sé ar gach gné de shaol na Gaeltachta agus de shaol Ghaelach na tíre. Tá sin le moladh chomh maith. Tá na tréimhseacháin Gaelacha ann ar nós Foinse agus Lá, atá ar fáil go laethúil anois.Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille. Tá súil agam go mbeidh a thionchar le feiceáil anseo sa Dáil chomh maith le taobh amuigh. Bhí feachtas ar siúl le fada gur chóir aitheantas níos fearr a thabhairt don Ghaeilge i bPairlimint na hEorpa agus go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ina teanga oibre inti. Ba chóir duinn cinntiú a dhéanamh de go mbeadh an Ghaeilge níos feiceálaí anseo i bPairlimint na hÉireann agus go mbeifear ag baint úsáid níos mó as an Ghaeilge in obair laethúil na Dála. Tá an córas aistriúcháin comhuaineach le fáil do Theachtaí nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus ná bíodh leisce ar dhuine ar bith úsáid a bhaint as. Nuair a thug an t-Uachtarán Mitterand cuairt ar an dTeach seo agus nuair a labhair sé i bhFraincis bhí an siondróm céanna ag cur as dúinn go léir agus is beag duine a chuir na cluasáin air fá choinne an aistriúcháin. Rinne muid orainn go raibh an Fhraincis againn.Beidh deis againn leasaithe a mholadh ar Chéim an Choiste. Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an Teachta O'Dowd, atá ag dul bhfeidhm go mór ar Fhine Gael ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ag cur leasaithe os comhair an Tí, comh maith le Teachtaí eile, agus go mbeidh deis againn iad a phlé leis an Aire. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an t-Aire ciallmhar go leor agus go nglacfaidh sé le leasaithe a bhfuil fiúntas leo. Tá daoine amuigh ansin atá ag fanacht leis an mBille seo agus ba mhaith leo go mbeadh sé éifeachtach nuair a bheadh sé achtaithe.Tréaslaím leis an Aire. Ta jab maith go leor déanta aige go dtí seo. Níl ins an mBille ach tús na hoibre. Ar mhaithe leis an teanga agus ar mhaithe leis an tír tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill. I will not be able to distinguish myself in the same way as Deputy McGinley and all the other Members who spoke in the debate. There is nothing as nice as hearing those able to put together a few words in Irish speak the language, whether in this Chamber or at public functions. There is something special about that. Watching the Minister and Deputy O'Dowd on the monitor, I noted their great command of the Irish language. As well as being special, the Irish language is part of our heritage. The ability to speak it tells a great deal about a person and shows a great passion.Deputy O'Connor's comments about his former parish priest reminded me of a parish priest we once had called Fr. Michael O'Dwyer who gave his sermon in Irish every St. Patrick's Day. I remember in my young days listening to him give these sermons and although I could not understand a word, I was highly impressed and the whole congregation listened.Some of us went to Irish college for short periods. Parents from County Tipperary send their children to Irish college in Counties Clare and Kerry. It is a terrible pity there are not more Irish language summer schools as they would help promote and foster a healthier attitude among our young people. One of my sons got into a little difficulty during a by-election and we had to waste a day of the campaign lecturing him and trying to get him to do things right.Those who have Irish will always be able to stand up and speak it. On the issue of schools, two gaelscoileanna in my constituency of Tipperary South are operating in terrible conditions. One, in Clonmel, was promised a new school on a new site three years ago which has still not been built. It operates out of an old county council building which is in a state of bad repair and the roofs are in deplorable condition. Were it not for voluntary effort, the children would not be able to attend this successful and highly rated school. If we were serious about promoting the Irish language, we would not neglect Gaelscoil buildings and would give them all necessary encouragement.Coming from County Tipperary where people are proud of their heritage, it would be remiss of me on this occasion not to mention the late Micheál Mac Cárthaigh, a former president of Conradh na Gaeilge whose family I know extremely well. Micheál was passionate about the Irish language. When I was growing up, he often used to speak to us in Irish to try to pass on a few words of the language. People such as him were so passionate about the language they gave all their free time to promote and develop it.I also welcome the use of Irish in council chambers. Some members of my county council are able to make a contribution in the Irish language, which always impresses me. Simple little things, even the use of the Irish and English versions of people's names in the council chamber, are also welcome.I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on a subject on which I feel strongly. I am disappointed that I have not been able to speak in Irish as other Members have done. I have not had time to do the course in Irish available to Members. However, I hope in future to be able to stand up in the Chamber and speak in Irish as well as the Minister.

Ní raibh stádas oifigiúil ar bith ag an Ghaeilge 100 bliain ó shin. Bhí Conradh na Gaeilge in ard a réim ag an am, eagraíocht a bhí chun tosaigh sa streachailt chun Éire nua a chruthú sa 20ú aois. Bhí slanú na Gaeilge mar príomh-aidhm ag na daoine a throid do neamhspleáchas na hÉireann. "Éire ní amháin saor ach Gaelach, ní amháin Gaelach ach saor" a dúirt Pádraig MacPiarais, céad Uachtarán na Poblachta.Tá a fhios againn uile cad a tharla. Ní saoirse a fuaireamar ach leath-saoirse do chuid amháin den tír agus daoirse fós sna Sé Chontae. Agus cé go raibh an Rialtas nua i mBaile Átha Cliath in ainm is a bheith Gaelach, lean meath na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.Cé go bhfuil stádas oifigiúil ag an Ghaeilge le fada an lá sna Sé Chontae is Fiche, ní hionann sin is a rá go bhfuil cearta teanga á chur i bhfeidhm. A mhalairt. Glacadh le Bunreacht de Valera 60 bliain ó shin agus faoin mBunreacht sin is í an Ghaeilge "an teanga náisiúnta" agus an "phríomhtheanga oifigiúil". D'ainneoin stádas na teanga sa Bhunreacht bhí gá le feachtas i ngach tréimhse ó shin chun cearta mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus cearta lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ar fud an Stáit a chosaint.Ní ón Stát a tháinig an t-éileamh agus an spreagadh chun an dá fhorbairt is tábhachtaí i saol na Gaeilge lenár linn – na stáisiúin craolacháin Ghaeilge idir raidió agus teilifis de, agus na gaelscoileanna. Is ón bpobal a tháinig siad agus bhí ar phobal na Gaeilge dul amach ar na sráideanna chun cearta a bhaint amach. I remember well during my years in the employment of an Irish bank participating in a major protest march in Béal Átha na Sluaidhe, Condae na Gaillimhe, agus bhí mé in éineacht leis an iar-Teachta Michael Kitt, nach maireann. Bhí sé sin i lár na seachtóidí sílim. Bhíomar go léir amuigh ar na sráideanna ar son na Gaeilge ag an am sin. Tá griangrafanna agam den mhórshiúl sin go fóill agus an Teachta Kitt inár measc.Is amhlaidh a bhí se leis an éileamh do Bhille chearta don Ghaeilge. Chuir Conradh na Gaeilge an t-éileamh seo os comhair an phobail ar dtús i 1977 agus tá sé mar éileamh ag pobal na Gaeilge ó shin. I 1998, faoi dheireadh, bhí an cuma air go raibh an Rialtas sásta guth na Gaeilge a aithint. Ag comhdháil Gaeilge ár bpáirtí, Slógadh Sinn Féin, i gCluain Eois i gContae Mhuineacháin i 1998, chuir mé fáilte roimh an plé-cháipéis maidir le hAcht teanga a d'fhoilsigh Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge an tseachtain sin. Gan obair mar sin ag na heagraíochtái Gaeilge, an Conradh, an Comhdháil, Gael-Linn agus ar uile, ní bheadh an Bille seo os ár gcomhair. Aithním, chomh maith, an obair atá déanta ag an Aire féin. Táimid ag fanacht ró-fhada leis an reachtaíocht seo ach ní chuirim an milleán sin ar an Aire. Bhí deacrachtaí aige le Ranna Stáit, agus leis an Roinn Airgeadais ach go háirithe, agus ina pháirtí féin. Murach deacrachtaí sin bheadh Bille níos láidre os ár gcomhair anois.Is céim thábhachtach ar aghaidh í an Bille seo. Is tús é agus ní teorainn é. Gan amhras, tá daoine ann gur mhaith leo teorainn a cur le cearta teanga agus le dualgais an Stáit i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Ba mhaith leo an Ghaeilge a fhágáil ar an imeall. Ach tá formhór mhuintir na hÉireann, agus formhór an phobail nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu san áireamh, báúil don Ghaeilge. Teastaíonn uainn an ceart a bheith ag gach duine a ghnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge, go háirithe i gcás seirbhísí poiblí agus gach gné den saol i gceantracha Gaeltachta ach go háirithe.Sa chomhthéacs sin is céim chun tosaigh í an Bille ach tá laigí bunúsacha ann. Ní leor an méid atá sa Bhille chun cearta na nGaeilgeoirí a chur i bhfeidhm agus ní leor an Bille chun an Ghaeilge a shlánu agus a chur ar ais i mbéal an phobail. Tá gá le straiséis teanga agus pleanáil teanga chun é sin a dhéanamh. Ba mhaith liom dhá laige a lua. Níl sé cinntithe sa Bhille go mbeidh seirbhís i nGaeilge le fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta ó chomhluchtaí poiblí gan cheist. Agus níl sé in-ghlactha go mbeidh mír sa Bhille a chuireann bac ar an saoránach dul chun na cúirte sa chás nach bhfuil na nithe atá á ngeallúint faoin mBille á gcur ar fáil dó nó di. Beidh Sinn Féin ag moladh leasaithe maidir leis na nithe seo agus le nithe eile sa reachtaíocht. Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an t-Aire le leasaithe an Fhreasúra. Is maith an rud gur ghlac sé le leasaithe tábhachtacha sa Seanad.Tugann fás an oideachais lán Ghaeilge dóchas duinn uile. Tá trí Ghaeilscoil i mo chontae féin, i mbaile Mhuineacháin féin tá Gaelscoil Ultan, i gCarraig Mhachaire Rois tá Gaelscoil Rois agus i gCluain Eois tá Scoil Rois. Tá géarghá anois le meánscoil Ghaeilge don chontae. Tá pobal ann chun freastal air agus tá pleananna chun meánscoil a chur ar bun i mbliana, má's féidir. Ach tá gá le ceadúnas agus tacaíocht ón Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh sin go luath. B'fhearr liom go mbeadh meánscoil Ghaelach tras-teorainn againn freisin. It is not just the prospect of looking at the three bunscoil i gContae Mhuineacháin, ach tá sruth lán Ghaeilge i gcathair Árd Mhacha, áit nach bhfuil i bhfad ó bhaile Mhuineacháin. Níl Carraig Mhachaire Rois ach 30 míle ó bhaile Mhuineacháin. D'fhéadfaí meanscoil tras-teorainn a thógáil i mbaile Mhuineacháin atá i gceartlár na mbailte sin.Uaireanta bíonn cuid des na meáin cumarsáide ag iarraidh a chur in iúl go bhfuil Sinn Féin ag baint mí-úsáid pholaitiúil as an dteanga. Ní fíor sin. Ní le Sinn Féin, le náisiúnaithe nó le hÉireannaigh amháin, fiú, an teanga. Is leis an cine daonna an teanga Ghaeilge. Dá gcaillfí an Ghaeilge chaillfí cuid de shaibhreas agus oidhreacht chultúrtha an domhain. Mar sin, tá an Ghaeilge mar chúram agus mar cheart againn. Tabhair dúinn ár gcearta agus beidh ár dteanga slán go deo.

What is the Government trying to hide or to achieve? Time has taught me that there is always a method to the Government's madness and I wonder what that is. While I do not have a problem agreeing to the content of the legislation, it will be a hard sell as far as the people are concerned, particularly when the country is suffering savage cutbacks as a result of the mismanagement of the Minister's party and the previous Government.I wish the Minister well in his task. He has done a good job in introducing and defending the Bill today. The Minister must answer for what happened over the past five or six years. He must explain why the Bill was not introduced during the good times.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Many people in our community have a strong love of the Irish language. I participate in Irish classes and I have a long way to go, although I used to be good at it. We must set an example. However, the people would be more impressed if the money proposed for the Bill was spent on the restoration of the home help service rather than on another office of the Civil Service to administer the Irish language. Somebody on a hospital waiting list does not care what language is written on his or her appointment card as long as it arrives before he or she dies. That is what the people will say when the Minister is forced to defend the introduction of the Bill. I want him to know what he will face. The Minister should try to explain the need for this Bill. Protesting students might appreciate this Bill if they were not busy trying to fight for a third level education devoid of fees.As soon as the Government introduces legislation which the country needs and is crying out for, I will salute it. I am talking about the Government allaying people's fears about walking on the streets and finding solutions to our housing and health crises. That would be more relevant. This is a good Bill, but I question its timing. While we all have a job to do, I hope the Government decides in the near future what the job of governing Ireland means. Is it to find solutions to our many problems or to complicate our lives and make them more difficult at every opportunity? Again, I refer to the Freedom of Information Act. The reason I ask how long this Bill has been in the pipeline is that it does not seem to reflect the needs of a modern Ireland. I welcome it but modern Ireland does and should reflect and pose the challenges of a multicultural society as people from all over the world seek out Ireland as a home. Any Bill which deals with official languages should reflect this.

There is a general perception that Wicklow is a wealthy county. While I appreciate that parts of it are fairly affluent there are parts that are not. It is similar to the Minister of State's former constituency. One has an image of Galway being vibrant with a university yet in south or east Galway there are areas that lag behind the rest of the county.The population of west Wicklow and east Carlow is in the region of 14,000. The area is served by the N81, a road which was identified in the national development plan for an upgrade between Blessington and Tallaght. Approximately £2.5 million was available several years ago for initial work on this but the money is no longer there. We have a situation where a road was mentioned for improvement works in the national development plan, money was available but now there is no money in place.Prior to the early 1970s an adult male in west Wicklow could not do his leaving certificate exam. There was a secondary school for girls in Baltinglass run by the Presentation sisters but right through Blessington, Dunlavin and Baltinglass there was no boys' secondary school that did a leaving certificate. Now, thanks to the vocational system, we have three schools, one in west Wicklow, one in Carlow at Hacketstown and one in Carnew.The reason I tabled this motion was to ask the Minister to try to place some employment in this area? The N81 that comes to Dublin is chaotic in the mornings. It is a road of inferior quality but is one of the busiest roads coming into Dublin. It needs investment.The national spatial strategy talks about the mid-east region which refers to Counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. Within that area it identifies two areas, north County Meath and south-west Wicklow, which are contrary to the general perception and economic development of the rest of the region. The Government should work in conjunction with local authorities and with the good staff it has in the area from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA who have brought employment to the county.I ask the Minister of State to relay the message to the Minister, Deputy Harney, that we would like to see jobs created in west Wicklow, south Wicklow and east Carlow. This is a forgotten area. People from the west of Ireland, good luck to them, have come into the House on a continuous basis to talk about employment and how deprived people are west of the Shannon. However, there are some parts of my constituency that are equally if not more deprived.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.Day-to-day responsibility for job creation rests with the agencies under my Department's aegis, namely, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the county enterprise boards. These bodies are continuing to address the employment needs of west Wicklow and east Carlow and to promote the area for suitable investment projects in the future.The focus of Enterprise Ireland in working with its client companies is on growing and increasing sales, exports and employment. Enterprise Ireland works with its client companies across all aspects of their business, from strategy to production, research and development to marketing and finance. In addition, Enterprise Ireland strives to maximise the number of sustainable job gains through the creation of new jobs by entrepreneurs setting up new high-potential start-up companies.Enterprise Ireland has supported 192 projects in County Wicklow. In 2002 there were over 5,400 full-time and 500 part-time employees in Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in the county. Over 20% of these jobs are in companies located in west Wicklow. Indeed, some of the largest employers in the county are located in west Wicklow, including Duffy Meats in Shillelagh and Glenealy Farms in Glenealy.

Enterprise Ireland will continue to foster an enterprise culture in the Wicklow area through its close involvement with its existing base of companies and encouraging new high-potential start-ups.East Carlow has traditionally been an agricultural area, with most of the industrial activity being located in the west of the county, primarily in Bagenalstown, Carlow town and Borris.In 2002, there were 2,524 full-time and 308 part-time jobs in Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Carlow. Enterprise Ireland approved support of €200,000 for the Carlow community enterprise centre under its new community enterprise programme in 2002 and an incubation facility for new enterprises at the Carlow Institute of Technology in 2001. In addition, over €2 million was approved for projects in the county in 2002.Indeed, only yesterday the Minister announced a major jobs initiative for Bagenalstown. Autolaunch, a local enterprise, is a start-up business with high export growth potential which will lead to the creation of 50 high-skilled jobs. Total investment in this project, which is supported by Enterprise Ireland, is €6 million.Turning to foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland, the agency with statutory responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment into the State, is supporting a number of companies in the west Wicklow area, including Wampfler, a German engineering company which established a business in 1974 which currently has 39 staff in Baltinglass, Icekin Mouldings, which started up in 1987 employing approximately 14 staff and the German company Rupp and Hubrach Opthalmic, which was introduced into Blessington in 1999 and currently employs 96 staff. The latter company is now operating at full capacity and IDA Ireland is in active discussions with Wicklow County Council to free up an adjoining site to facilitate an expansion by the company that will lead to further jobs for the people of west Wicklow.In addition, the close proximity of the area to Citywest/Tallaght and the towns of Naas and Newbridge means that a considerable number of employment options exist or will come on stream in the future in IDA companies there for the people of west Wicklow. A number of companies in the electronics, internationally traded services and software sectors such as AOL, GE Interlogix, UPS and SAP, have established operations in the Citywest/Tallaght area and will continue to grow and create jobs in line with projections.Carlow town is the main area of attraction for foreign direct investment in County Carlow. In promoting Carlow town for development IDA Ireland is developing a new 70 acre business and technology park and planning permission has already been granted for two 50,000 sq. ft. high-specification office buildings in the park. IDA Ireland is also in discussion with developers to build a 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory in the park to attract more traditional manufacturing type investment. New projects will be targeted at the international services sector, including software development, financial services and customer services operations.Carlow is included in the south-east regional plan to introduce broadband interconnectivity between major towns in the region. This is currently being worked on and when operational will further increase the attractiveness of east Carlow to foreign investors.The county enterprise boards in Carlow and Wicklow continue to work actively with local people to set up, grow and develop micro-enterprises. The boards, whose work results in dispersed economic development throughout the region provide a comprehensive system of capital and employment grants, and support, mentoring, advice, training and development for new and existing micro-enterprises.In 2002, the latest year for which figures are available, approximately €264,000 was approved in grant funding creating a net total of 51 jobs in west Wicklow and east Carlow. An enterprise awareness roadshow was carried out in Hacketstown in 2002 and a start your own business course was also delivered in the area. I further understand that other initiatives such as the women in business initiative and a management development programme were delivered in the region. The Carlow and Wicklow boards will continue to remain active in helping new and existing micro-enterprises in the area.While not having a specific job creation remit, FÁS in its role of increasing the employment skills of the workforce, provides a range of supports in the region. It also supports 112 employees in community employment enterprises through the social economy programme.I am confident that the initiatives being pursued by my Department's agencies, in partnership with other local organisations and in the context of the Government's continued commitment to regional development, will result in benefits to the west Wicklow and east Carlow areas.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	321	My matter relates to cruising to tax advantage. According to a report in a national newspaper this week, a consortium of wealthy Irish businessmen and professionals have purchased the luxury yacht, the Christina O, formerly the property of the legendary Aristotle Onassis, for $50 million. Domestic tax law allows them to claim capital allowances for the purchase of the yacht and for its refurbishment and to set these costs against their Irish income for tax avoidance purposes. It is a worthy and successful business enterprise for these investors, but it is absurd that such a venture attracts such significant tax breaks for those involved and that the tax code still has many devices such as this embedded in it.President McAleese stated recently that alcohol abuse is the dark side of our social life, but tax avoidance by the wealthy is the dark side of the economy. I do not wish to comment on any individual. However, I wish to highlight the general principle of tax breaks that enable wealthy persons to achieve a virtual tax free status in the this State, as was shown in the Revenue review of a sample case group of high earners some months ago. A number of other examples related to capital allowances have come to light in recent times, notably the sale and lease back set up for property at the IFSC and the capital allowances concession granted astonishingly to the promoters of the Kinnegad motorway PPP project.All of these devices, sponsored and fostered by Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, allow wealthy individuals to essentially decide how much tax to pay. The Revenue survey of the wealthy showed that significant percentages of high earning individuals paid no tax or paid tax at low rates. In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last December, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy stated that of the approximately 53,6000 taxpayers who acknowledged gross incomes over €100,000 in 2002, some 31,500 were self-employed, including proprietary directors. The Minister confessed that a relatively small number of persons, approximately 3% of taxpayers, declared such incomes. This is a ludicrous figure, totally unsupported by the data from the household budget survey.The tax avoidance industry starves the health and education services and creates a deeply divided society that runs totally counter to the ideals of those who fought for our national independence. I call on the Minister of State to categorically set out the benefits accruing to the proprietors of the scheme of the yacht scheme I mentioned. Parents are currently deeply worried about the imposition of further swingeing fees for third level education and they deserve an answer. It is ironic that the wealthy can yet again benefit from the Minister for Finance's largesse. For all his bluster at budget time about closing tax loopholes, the Minister has been equally busy creating new ones while continuing to ignore notorious existing ones.It is excessively difficult to obtain detailed information regarding the operation of such schemes and the beneficiaries. The information is often refused by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners on the grounds that to do so would undermine the correct principle of confidentiality between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners. However, these are large schemes and are a significant cost in terms of tax expenditure. They starve our health and education systems of so much in the way of resources that the Minister must come clean on tax avoidance. I hope the Minister of State will not hide behind such excuses. If we are to have a rational and reasoned debate about tax avoidance and tax breaks and the additional economic activity they generate, we need the full facts.

The Deputy will be aware of the principle of confidentiality that applies to an individual or corporate taxpayer's dealings with the Revenue Commissioners and of the long standing independence of the commissioners in that regard. Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on the case concerned and can reply to the matter in general terms only. However, it would be less than prudent to rush to judgment on this or any other case on the basis of newspaper reports alone. It cannot be presumed that the matter reported in the media has had the outcome suggested.

I deserve an answer. This is a major scheme and officials in the Minister of State's Department, as well as those in the Revenue, are aware of its parameters. He should provide an appropriate reply to the House.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	324	If the Deputy gives me an opportunity to continue, I might get around to it. As she will be aware, it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, in the first instance, to determine whether particular arrangements are effective for tax purposes. I have no doubt the Revenue is fully aware of the newspaper report concerned.On the general issue of contrived arrangements, the Minister's position is well known and his record speaks for itself. Tax incentives are there to be used and to encourage investment which would not otherwise be made. The Minister has difficulty when incentives, or the tax code in general, are used in highly artificial and "packaged" ways, which can greatly reduce effective tax rates on high incomes. This is unfair to the general body of taxpayers and works against the progressivity of the tax system.In recent years the Minister has taken action on a number of occasions against tax avoidance schemes that used tax incentives and the tax code in this way. Action was taken in 1998 against asset backed schemes that had been set up to maximise special incentive reliefs on industrial buildings. Schemes involving limited partnerships were severely restricted in 2000 and in 2002 legislation addressed abuses involving personal portfolio bonds and reverse premiums. This year measures were targeted against passive investors in the areas of electricity generation, the film and music industries and oil and gas exploration. These measures ring-fenced the reliefs concerned so that they can only be used to shelter an individual's income from tax to the extent, if any, that it is earned from the trade.Deputies may recall that the Minister also acted this year to close a loophole involving the transfer of capital allowances on certain buildings from companies to individual investors. Under this measure, where a building in respect of which a company has claimed capital allowances is sold to individual investors, they will be entitled to set the capital allowances related to the building solely against their rental income from the building concerned. it subsequently came to the Minister's attention that arrangements were being considered, the effect of which would be to circumvent the then Finance Bill provisions through the use of loan finance by investors in an intermediary company or partnership. His response was to act immediately to close off these further contrived arrangements by announcing measures that will be included in the 2004 budget and Finance Bill, with retrospective effect to 19 March 2003.The Minister's record, and that of the Government, is, therefore, clear and unambiguous. The Exchequer must and will be protected against contrived schemes and arrangements that undermine the tax base. The Deputy can rest assured that if further abuses or objectionable arrangements come to light, the Minister will not hesitate to take action and to legislate against them with immediate effect.

Due to its proximity to Listowel and the spiralling cost of sites in the town, a large number of houses have been built in the vicinity of the school. These houses belong in the main to young married couples with families and returned emigrants with families. A large number of building sites have also been sold in the area. Three of the existing classrooms are far too small for full classes in modern times. When they were built in 1964 the numbers in the school were much less. There is no room for storage or computers and movement in corridors is restricted for both teachers and pupils.A pupil had a serious accident in her classroom in September 2002 when she fell while going from the blackboard to her seat. The classrooms do not lend themselves to the implementation of the revised curriculum as envisaged by the Department of Education and Science or by the school management. Therefore, consideration should be given to redesigning these three rooms as special tuition rooms, a general office and a multipurpose room. As these rooms are to the front of the building they are readily accessible to all.The existing GP room is inadequate for the size of the school. There is also no access to it without accessing the main building, the children's toilets and corridors with confidential files. Therefore, community groups using this room have access to the whole building and to the alarm system. Consideration should be given to converting the existing GP room into a staff room and resource area with room for the storage for materials. It is simply located within the building.The current staff room is just nine sq. m. It also doubles as the secretary's office and contains a photocopier and computer. As of 12 September 2002, there were 11 teachers, three SNAs and one secretary. All of these use the staff room daily, not accounting for visitors such as the chairman of the board of management, inspectors and so on.As already stated, filing cabinets are currently stored by necessity in a corridor, thus reducing the width of the corridor to 1,100 millimetres. The recommendation of the Department of Education and Science is 1,800 millimetres. There is a serious and urgent lack of storage space. Total storage in the school is a cleaners' room of three sq. m. Even the staff have had to put the fridge into this cleaners' room. There is no storage provided with any classroom or GP room and there is no strong room in the building.There is no library or resource room. Neither is there any facility for a computer room, which is essential at this time. There is no principal's office despite the fact that the school has an administrative position. If parents call to the school they have to be dealt with in the corridor or the yard. A private or confidential phone call has to be taken in the toilet. There is no hot water supply to any basins for pupils. There is hot water to two of the staff toilets only.There are four entrances to the building from the front. This has given rise to serious security considerations as it is impossible to monitor access. Three old classrooms were each built with their own access. There is no corridor and pupils and teachers going from one of these classrooms to the other parts of the building must go outside the building. This is entirely impractical and, indeed, dangerous for the younger pupils. A corridor should be provided along the front of these three rooms, thus linking them to the main entrance. This would increase security considerably.There are no sanitary facilities for handicapped people in the building. The present building is entirely flat roofed. This has never been satisfactory. New structures in particular should not be flat roofed. There is a lack of staff toilets, for women in particular, as there is only one toilet for 13 female teachers at break time.I appeal to the Minister to consider the request for temporary accommodation for September. I understand that approval for this has been forwarded to the Department of Education and Science by the local inspector, Mr. O'Donovan. The principal has identified the need for extra accommodation since 2002, when he knew that he would have an extra appointment. I know the Minister of State present is not responsible for this, but given the fact that this is my alma mater, I have a special interest in it, so he might do his best to ensure that temporary accommodation is provided in September.

Some of the examples the Deputy point out are very much like my own alma mater, but thankfully we have a new school in Coolderry.The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details regarding individual projects are now available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. Section 12 of the programme sets out the details of the temporary accommodation projects that were approved by the Department of Education and Science. However, based on the budgetary allocation it was not possible to make provision for any further temporary accommodation projects, including the application from Drumclough national school.The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on applications that could not be included in this year's programme. In the meantime the management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters. Again I thank the Deputy. I wish I had some better news for him on this occasion.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Passage West is the forgotten town of my constituency of Cork South-Central. At its height in the 19th century it was the most desirable of areas and a centre for commerce in the general Cork harbour region. It was from here that the Sirius, the first steam boat to cross the Atlantic from Ireland, left.Since then there seems to have been little or no change in the basic road infrastructure or planning and development to enhance the urban environment of Passage West. For this, many State authorities need to take responsibility. My colleague, Councillor Joe Snow, a member of what was Passage West Town Commissioners and a member of the town council since 1994, has raised many of these issues on regular occasions with the authorities concerned.As a Member of this House, I am challenging the various Departments to use whatever influence they can to offer tax designation, soon to run out, to kick-start much needed development to the centre of Passage West. Many difficulties exist in bringing about that development and some impediments have been unenforced and historical. For instance, much of Passage West was designated as a Seveso risk zone due to the existence of the IFA plant at Marino Point, which has since closed with the loss of 200 jobs, many of them held by people from the Passage West area.That put a dampener on modern development on the dock side of Passage West. There is a private dock in the centre of the town which, competing with the Port of Cork Company, is taking cargoes of the most unacceptable type – loose bulk cargoes. This included coal at one stage, though that has stopped, but still includes animal feeds and fertilisers. This takes place in close proximity to urban dwellings and the standard and quality of life of people living in the centre of Passage West has been immeasurably damaged as a result of this continued type of activity.The owners and promoters of the dock site wish to use the land at that location in a more productive way. The existence of urban development tax designation for the site allows for the possibility of smaller commercial units and, in particular, residential units. There are planning concerns to overcome about density and height of likely developments but they can be overcome. The difficulty has been in making a development of any type on this site feasible. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Minister of State's own Department of Finance, which is responsible for tax designation, and the Department for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources need to operate together. For instance, the latter Department is asking for €3 million for in-fill of the bay to make overall development possible in Passage West. It is this lack of joined up thinking in Government circles that is particularly disadvantaging Passage West.The other major difficulty is the fact that along with other changes in the 20th century, traffic has increased but there have been no changes to the road infrastructure. The cross-river ferry taking vehicles mainly from Cobh to Cork city has increased traffic. There is heavy vehicle traffic going to the private dock development and again there have been no changes. In the centre of the town there is an oval shaped junction where nine roads converge and on which traffic can turn in 17 different directions, making it worse than the Red Cow roundabout.There is a reluctance to address this obvious impediment. If the area was revitalised, Government agencies could point to the value of public investment in achieving a town worth aspiring to.I hope the Government will give consideration to giving the power and means for many of these changes to be initiated in Passage itself. Passage was a town commissioner centre and now has a town council, but lacks the enhanced powers of what used to be a UDC. The real problem is the lack of responsiveness from both county local authorities and Government agencies to the various requests of people who know the problems most intimately and are best able to solve them. I hope the Minister of State can take that strident message to his ministerial colleagues.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Passage West was designated for tax incentives under the urban renewal scheme in 1999. Under the scheme, specific areas in five cities and 38 towns throughout the country were designated for tax incentives for both commercial and residential development. The scheme took a more planned, integrated and focused approach to tax incentive based urban regeneration than earlier initiatives. Designations under the scheme were based on integrated area plans submitted by local authorities and were in line with recommendations made by an independent expert advisory panel on urban renewal, which was established to assess all the plans submitted. Five areas in Passage West were designated for incentives under the scheme.As the Deputy will be aware, the Seveso directive came into effect in December 2000, providing for a wider scope and more stringent controls for monitoring establishments involved in the use of dangerous substances. Under the regulation, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is obliged, when requested, to give technical advice to the planning authorities in respect of planning applications for developments in the vicinity of establishments covered by the directive.In accordance with this, Cork County Council requested the HSA's advice in respect of proposed developments in Passage West close to the IFI plant at Marino Point. The HSA's advice, based on detailed risk analysis, was that no development, or only limited development, be permitted in zones surrounding the IFI plant. These zones incorporated development sites in and around Passage West.Following discussions with IFI and its advisers on the safety report and a revised quantified risk assessment submitted by IFI, the HSA issued revised advice to Cork County Council on 8 October 2001. The advice to Cork County Council was that the HSA considered the proposals for sensitive developments – hospitals, nursing homes, sheltered accommodation, schools, etc. – should be forwarded to the HSA for consultation, and that the HSA did not advise against any other type of development. The IFI plant at Marino Point has since closed down.The pace of development in this region was affected by this process, and as the urban renewal scheme 1999 was due to terminate at the end of 2002, concern was expressed that the tax reliefs could be lost which would affect potential investment in the area. However, in the Finance Act 2002, this deadline was extended to 31 December 2004 for projects where 15% of project costs, including land acquisition costs, had been incurred by 31 December 2002. In budget 2003, the Minister for Finance further extended the timeframe for incurring 15% of costs to the end of June 2003. These initiatives were intended to allow as much time as possible for projects in the various areas covered by the scheme, including Passage West, to comply with the 15% expenditure threshold, in order to qualify for the two-year extension to the scheme.It was stressed at the time that eligible projects should be progressed to construction as quickly as possible in order to avail of the incentives and achieve the objectives set in the various integrated area plans. The Minister for Finance has clearly indicated in budget 2003 that given the current and prospective budgetary position, the existing demand for property investment and the desire to improve equity in the tax system, it is not proposed to continue with the various urban renewal tax incentive based schemes after the end of 2004.The Dáil adjourned at 7.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 23 May 2003.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	331	For the purposes of the rural environmental protection scheme, a "farmer" is defined as "an individual agricultural producer, whether a natural or legal person or a group of natural or legal persons, whatever legal status is granted the group and its members by national law, whose holding is within the State". The legal framework for the establishment of milk production partnerships is set out in Statutory Instrument No. 97 of 2002 and confers legal status on such partnerships. Accordingly a milk production partnership is a "farmer" for the purposes of REPS.It is a condition of REPS that a farmer must declare all the land farmed in the agri-environmental plan for the holding. Currently, therefore, only one REPS application may be made by a partnership and all the land farmed by the partnership must be included in the farm plan. The possession of herd numbers is not the deciding factor in determining eligibility for REPS.Where farmers enter into a milk partnership and where one or both are already REPS participants, my Department is obliged to look for a refund of the REPS payments unless a new REPS agreement for the entire area farmed under the partnership is entered into.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	332	In line with current EU developments I am developing a national genotype programme, NGP. The programme, which will be available this autumn, will provide a blood testing service to flock owners throughout the country to determine the level of susceptibility of sheep to scrapie. On testing, I envisage a role for the veterinary laboratory service of my Department and for private laboratories which may be approved to offer a commercial service to flock owners. The outcome of testing will provide a basis for official certification of individual animals, the accreditation of individual flocks according to their levels of susceptibility to the disease and implementation of breeding programmes designed to enhance resistance to scrapie in the national flock. I will elaborate further on the detail of the NGP as the design of various aspects is finalised. It is my intention that it will be as user-friendly as possible and that it will provide a valuable and efficient service to flock owners.As a precursor to the fully-fledged NGP, and in line with EU requirements, my Department is currently undertaking a genetic survey of sheep breeds, which involves taking and testing blood samples from animals in a number of flocks throughout the country. This is progressing satisfactorily although it is as yet too early to draw any overall conclusions.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I am sympathetic to the spirit and objective of the French proposals. The proposals themselves acknowledge that developing countries are net importers of agricultural products from temperate regions and that they derive benefits from export subsidies on those products. Before proceeding, therefore, it is necessary to examine the impact of the proposals on each developing country and in relation to individual products. The French proposal is based on an acceptance of a moratorium on all forms of agricultural export subsidies by all exporting countries and not just the EU.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 69 together.The numbers of reported cases of Johne's disease have increased significantly in recent years. Until recently, measures taken by my Department have included the purchase and slaughter of diseased animals, and in some rare cases entire herds. While the disease is notifiable, there is no obligation on the State under the provisions of the Johne's Disease Order 1955 to purchase and slaughter animals affected with Johne's disease, notwithstanding the fact that the Department has purchased infected animals. However, the current trend in cases of the disease has led to the conclusion that our historical approach has not contained, much less eradicated the disease and that expenditure on the purchase-slaughter of animals no longer generates a worthwhile return. Therefore, in mid-January 2003, a decision was taken to cease the practice of purchase and slaughter and to commit to an overall review of our approach to dealing with this issue.That review essentially involves examining and agreeing ways in which the resources of all interested parties can be marshalled to give a new direction and momentum to efforts to tackle Johne's disease in the national herd. As a first step in formulating a new approach, my Department is engaged in a comprehensive round of meetings over the month of May with key interests. Initial meetings have already been held with Teagasc, Veterinary Ireland, ICBF and key breed societies and with the major dairy co-ops. A meeting with the farmer representative bodies is due to take place next week.This process will be worthwhile in gaining a general recognition and understanding of the problem, securing an acceptance that success is achievable only if all concerned make a sustained commitment to tackle the problem and indicating the role which each party can most usefully play within an integrated and more effective policy approach. Arising from this round of meetings, my Department will draw together the various outputs and will bring the matter to the next stage of policy formulation. I am anxious that a new approach to tackling the problem of Johne's disease be put in place with the minimum of delay so that we can collectively begin to make some real headway in dealing with the problem.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	335	As a result of concerns expressed by consumers on this and other issues, I established a food labelling group to examine issues surrounding food labelling in general. This group reported to me last December and this specific issue was raised in the context of the group's recommendations.There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. However, differences were expressed on how origin should be defined. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers wishes in this area.I have since established an interdepartmental/agency committee to progress the recommendations in this report. This committee is comprised of the Department of Agriculture and Food; the Department of Health and Children; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; and the Food Safety Promotion Board.The Consumer Liaison Panel has drawn up a strategy for consumer research to establish the concerns of consumers about food labelling generally. This strategy includes the issue of origin. I intend to arrange to have research commissioned on this basis.

Detailed reviews of the two other active substances and of products containing them have been undertaken. Those reviews will among other things have particular regard to the need to ensure that the health of users, amateur and professional, is protected and unacceptable influence on the environment is avoided.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	337	It was recently decided to amend the policy on the movement of sheep to agricultural shows following consultation with the industry. The following rules will apply for shows held in 2003 which include sheep from scrapie monitored flocks: two groups of sheep will be permitted to attend such shows: (1) sheep from scrapie monitored flocks, and (2) sheep from flocks which have joined the scrapie monitored flock scheme, but have not completed the three year probationary period.Flock owners will require documentary evidence from their district veterinary office as to the status of their flocks. There must be complete separation of the two categories of sheep at the show. Ideally, this would mean a separate entrance and exit for each group, separate loading and unloading areas, separate penning areas for each of the two groups and separate sale rings for each of the two groups.In locations where all of that which I have outlined may not be possible, the minimum requirement would be for separation of loading and unloading areas and of penning areas. The two penning areas should be separated by a sheep free alleyway at least 12 feet wide. If only one sale ring is available, the sheep from the scrapie monitored flocks must be offered for sale first.There may be separate and additional requirements for sheep, which are intended for export to Northern Ireland.In shows which may be held in 2004 and subsequent years, entry will be restricted to sheep from scrapie monitored flocks and from flocks which applied to join the scheme in 2003. Any flock owner who applies to join the scheme after the 2003 show season will have to complete the three year probationary period before being allowed to present sheep at shows.A show may decide to only have sheep from flocks which are in neither of the two groups described above. In these cases, none of the rules outlined need apply.When a flock owner applies to join the scrapie monitored flock scheme, a farm inspection must be carried out before the flock can be accepted into the scheme. Any farmer considering entering the scheme should make an application to his district veterinary office in sufficient time to allow this inspection to be carried out in advance of a show.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	338	In 1999, I set up the Agri-Food 2010 Committee to propose a strategy for the development of agriculture and food over the next decade. The committee, which was drawn from the agricultural sector and the food industry, published its report, Agri-Food 2010 Main Report, in March 2000. My Department took on board the recommendations of the expert committee and formulated the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action, which contained 197 action points. The plan of action is a comprehensive approach to the future of the agricultural sector, envisaging a dynamic agri-food sector, and offering farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus maintaining the maximum number of people on the land.In December 2001, I published the Agri-Food Implementation Report, which outlined the progress of the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action. In all 94% of the action points have been completed or have seen substantial action completed. My Department's statement of strategy and the 2010 plan of action contain commitments for overseeing the further implementation of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee's recommendations.I am conscious of the very immediate challenges facing the agri-food sector in the context of the mid-term review of CAP and the WTO talks. Accordingly, I have given a commitment, and it has been set down in the chapter on agriculture in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to re-examine the Agri-Food 2010 Report and to update it in the light of developments under the mid-term review and WTO.In the context of the ever changing environment in which the agri-food sector operates, I shall continue to pursue policies and operate programmes which will enable farm families to enjoy living standards in line with general economic and social development and maintain an agri-food sector which is profitable, competitive, sustainable and innovative.

The recommendations cover a wide range of policy issues encompassing rural development, access to education and training, representation of women at political organisational level, access to information technology, social inclusion, personal finance, economic and other legal issues. The report has facilitated the development of policy and encourages positive female role models in agriculture. In particular my Department chaired an interdepartmental working group on PRSI, which highlighted the option of establishing farm partnerships, which may entitle farm spouses to certain social welfare benefits, which facilitates financial recognition of their input.Many of the report's overall findings have been incorporated into the National Plan for Women which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Significant progress has been made in implementing the report's detailed recommendations and most of the recommendations falling within my Department's remit have been implemented.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Following publication of the Commission's full mid-term review, MTR, proposals in January, I requested FAPRI Ireland to study the effects of the European Commission's proposals taking into account the detailed proposals for the mid-term review of the CAP and the current round of World Trade Organisation trade negotiations.The study looks at the full MTR proposals, including not just decoupling, but degression, modulation and further reforms of the dairy and cereals sectors. The study also takes account of the proposals submitted to WTO by the Commission on negotiations on the current trade round. The analysis in the FAPRI Ireland document is provided at both aggregate and farm levels.This independent study confirms that the MTR and WTO proposals have important implications for Ireland and Irish agriculture. I am referring the FAPRI Ireland study to the consultative groups for each sector that I established to consider the mid-term review proposals and the consultative group on WTO for their consideration.

The purpose of the meeting was to review the state of the beef industry and to consider the best market strategy for the industry in the short to medium term.A number of issues were agreed at that meeting. First, the participants accepted that the Bord Bia market strategy involving Irish beef moving up the value chain within the EU and gaining a greater spread of markets, represented the best way forward for the industry. This involves applying greater efforts in maximising the returns from core European markets, including Italy and Holland, targeting growth in European developing markets such as Scandinavia and France, and developing niche opportunities in Germany, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. In this context the UK will continue to be our largest core market for beef and the strategy ahead will involve increasing the volume of overall trade at retail level in the UK.Second, on third country markets there was an acceptance of the need to avail of every market open to Irish beef and in this regard processors will continue to supply the important Russian market and will renew commercial efforts to supply our traditional and important third country markets.The participants agreed also on the importance of introducing mechanical classification at an early date. I undertook to press hard at EU level to advance a framework regulation to facilitate the early introduction of a EU-wide mechanical classification system. I expect that a new EU regulation allowing the introduction of mechanical classification will be adopted next month. Testing of machines should commence in September-October with a view to machines being operational in factories by year-end.

The necessity to get advance clearance from the CMMS data for animals intended for slaughter houses has been temporarily suspended. We are satisfied that other safeguards are adequate because all animals are subject to veterinary inspection and other identity checks. The union has agreed to ease restrictions in relation to herds affected by tuberculosis and brucellosis. They have established a committee with a representative in each of the offices engaged in the industrial action who review applications to temporarily ease restrictions on a case by case basis and this is being pursued with the union.My Department regrets the hardship caused to the farming community due to the industrial action taken by CPSU members and we are endeavouring to resolve the dispute.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I have received representations on behalf of a number of farmers in County Monaghan who wish to have their lands, currently classified as less severely handicapped, reclassified as more severely handicapped. The position is that officials of my Department have met with European Commission officials on at least two occasions since May 2002 at which consideration was given to the possibility of reclassifying the remaining 15% of County Monaghan as more severely handicapped.That part of County Monaghan currently designated as less severely handicapped did not satisfy the criteria for designation as more severely handicapped when the last reclassification took place. In the meetings with my officials to which I have referred the Commission indicated that any formal request now for further reclassification would inevitably lead the Commission to ask us to justify our current designation and classifications for all areas. As this could lead to the possibility of the current classification of disadvantaged areas being open to question the timing and nature of any further reclassification request would require very careful consideration.The measures in the CAP rural development plan including the disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme are currently being evaluated. A report will be presented to the European Commission later this year. In that context I expect to have a further opportunity to raise the issue of reclassification with the Commission.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	350	My Department has made a very strong case to the European Commission outlining specific proposals to deal with the overshoot on the Special Beef Premium in respect of 2002. The main justification put forward for special treatment of Ireland's overshoot was the fact that the early publication of a confidential draft legal text of the Commission proposals for the mid-term review gave rise to a surge of applications submitted to my Department in late December 2002 which contributed to the scale of the overshoot.The Commission, in its reply, acknowledges the exceptional circumstances leading to the overshoot in 2002 and specifically the impact that the leaking of these proposals had on the scale of the overshoot. It goes on to state that it is not ready to propose a derogation from the Council regulation while this issue is part of the current discussion on the reform proposals in the Council.I am satisfied that the Commission implicitly acknowledges that this matter may be further considered in the context of the mid-term review negotiations and I will now take this matter up direct with Commissioner Fischler.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I am aware of certain concerns regarding the impact of the common agricultural policy on developing countries and I am sympathetic to the needs of these developing countries. However, it should first be noted that changes have been implemented in the common agricultural policy to significantly reduce trade anomalies and these changes have brought about a system of direct payments, which are acknowledged as being less trade distorting. The overall EU support – Producer Support Estimate – for agriculture has decreased from 42% in the period 1986-88 to 35% in 2001 and under the Uruguay Round Agreement, the EU has already reduced its ceiling of expenditure on export refunds by 21% in terms of the quantities subsidised and by 36% in budgetary outlay. EU export subsidies are becoming less and less significant and in 2001 they amounted to €2.763 billion compared to €10 billion in 1991. Ireland supports the EU mandate in the current WTO negotiations whereby the EU is prepared to negotiate, under certain conditions, further reductions in export refunds.We must also recognise that in 2002 EU direct payments to Irish farmers accounted for 69% of Irish aggregate farm income and that transfers from the EU totalled €1,903.4 million euro in 2002. Therefore Ireland has a significant national interest in the CAP.Although there is much criticism of the CAP, the facts are that the EU as a whole operates a more favourable agricultural trading system with developing countries than other trade blocks and special and differential treatment for developing countries is an essential element of the EUs position in the WTO negotiations. The EU imports more farm products from developing countries than the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand taken together. It is the largest importer from least developed countries and has introduced the "Everything But Arms" programme, which gives the 49 poorest countries immediate duty and quota-free access to EU markets with the exceptions of bananas, sugar and rice where transitional arrangements apply.It should also be remembered that EU subsidies are not the only issue for developing countries as these are not a homogenous group. Their needs should be carefully examined on a case-by-case basis. Many are net food importers who have concerns that in the absence of export subsidies they would not be able to source imports.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	352	The feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants was banned in 1990. I assume that the Deputys question refers to cases of BSE in animals born after the introduction of enhanced control measures in relation to meat and bone meal, specified risk materials and the processing of mammalian waste in introduced in October, 1996, and February and March 1997 respectively. To date a total of seven BSE cases were born in 1997 and two animals were born in 1999. Having examined the relevant records, my Department is satisfied as to the ages of these animals.An epidemiological investigation is carried out in all BSE cases and a particularly detailed investigation was carried out in respect of the two 1999-born cases. While factors which could be associated with BSE have been identified in the farms involved, the exact cause of BSE in either of the two cases could not be identified. In any event, there is no evidence that these or the small number of other cases born after 1996 are symptomatic of a general or widespread problem with controls and this is borne out by the general trend at present.Indeed the fact remains, despite these cases, that the underlying trend in relation to BSE is extremely encouraging. The age profile of animals confirmed with the disease is increasing, and this illustrates the effect the controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 have had on the rate of exposure. In 2002 less than 2% of cases were identified in animals less than six years old at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed is a positive indication that these additional controls are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.In addition, in the period 1st January to 30 April 2003, the number of BSE cases identified, at 82, was 38% less than the number confirmed in the corresponding period of 2002-03.My Department will continue to rigorously enforce BSE controls in a manner which, in the first instance, provides assurance to consumers in relation to the safety of Irish beef, which protects animal health and which safeguards the future of the very important Irish beef sector.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 52 together.In January 2001, to address the situation faced by the cattle sector, and against the background of particular difficulties being faced by the beef sector due to the closure of non EU markets, I introduced a subsidy towards the cost of rendering offal into MBM and its subsequent storage and disposal. It was always intended that the subsidy would be short-term to facilitate an adjustment by the livestock sector to the changed legislative environment and the difficulties in the beef market at the time. Since then the level of subsidy has been gradually reduced. Since last October, when the rendering industry became fully responsible for MBM disposal, significant quantities of MBM have been exported for incineration and no additional quantities of stocks have been accepted for disposal by the State.There is nevertheless, a backlog of stock under departmental control of 170,000 tonnes awaiting disposal. In my view every effort should be made to make use of MBM in a way that extracts maximum value from it, in either energy production or industrial use, and thereby reduce disposal costs. This is the position in many other member states. This would be of benefit to the economy generally in terms of reducing the use of fossil fuels and would also be of benefit to the agriculture sector. Any disposal facilities would, of course, have to fully comply with the environmental and planning requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, and would have to be in full compliance with EU animal by-products regulations.We need to face up to the responsibility of dealing with the waste and by-products of livestock industries. Failure to do so is strategically unwise in the long run and leaves one of our primary natural resource industries exposed to competitive pressure from those countries who are willing to face the reality of having a modern animal and livestock sector.

I also discussed the proposals informally with the Commissioner in the margins of the Informal Meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in Corfu on 10-13 May and also with a number of ministerial colleagues in the Council. The negotiations on the Commissions proposals will continue at the Council meetings on 26-27 May and 11-12 June when, subject to advance receipt of the opinion of the European Parliament, the Presidency aims to seek agreement. Detailed analysis is continuing at various working groups and also at a specially constituted high level group.

On this basis, the proposed new rates would be €200 for the first 20 hectares, €175 for the next 20 hectares, €70 for the next 15 hectares, cumulative up to a maximum of 55 hectares per holding.This would in effect mean that a REPs farmer with a holding of 20 hectares would receive €4,000 per annum; a holding of 40 hectares would receive €7,500 per annum; and a holding of 55 hectares would receive €8,550 per annum.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The ministerial declaration agreed at Doha in November 2001, which launched the current round of WTO negotiations, set 31 March 2003 as the date by which an agreement on modalities would be concluded. The WTO Committee on Agriculture, in which the negotiations on agriculture are conducted, failed to meet that deadline. The negotiations will continue in the Committee on Agriculture with a view to reaching agreement before or at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún, Mexico, in September. The intention will be to proceed then to negotiate specific reduction commitments and to agree the terms of a new round by the beginning of 2005 as envisaged in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.Despite the failure to reach agreement on modalities, I expect that the ultimate deadline set for the conclusion of the current round can be met.

The necessity to get advance clearance from the CMMS data for animals intended for slaughter houses has been temporarily suspended. We are satisfied that other safeguards are adequate because all animals are subject to veterinary inspection and other identity checks. The union has agreed to ease restrictions in relation to herds affected by tuberculosis and brucellosis. They have established a committee with a representative in each of the offices engaged in the industrial action who review applications to temporarily ease restrictions on a case by case basis and this is being pursued with the union.

The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Agri-Food 2010 Plan of Action contained the Governments response to issues dealt within the main report of the independent 2010 committee. The need to develop viable full-time and part-time farmers was one of the issues addressed. Subsequent actions taken by my Department were to ensure that part-time farmers had equal access to agricultural schemes on the same basis as full-time farmers and to encourage the development of off-farm employment opportunities.The Agri-Food 2010 implementation report showed that equal access by part-time farmers to schemes has been established by devising a common system of income units. For on-farm investment grants and installation aid part-time farmers are allowed to use both on-farm and off-farm income to meet the minimum viability thresholds. The early retirement scheme introduced in 2000 allows for participation by part-time farmers as transferors and transferees and the enlargement clause was removed.Part-time farmers are also eligible the same direct payment as full-time farmers and have benefited from the increased payments under Agenda 2000. Similarly, other market support measures such as intervention and export refunds which help maintain output prices benefit both full and part-time farmers.The rural viability services offered by Teagasc contributes to meeting the needs of part-time farmers and identifying methods of boosting their household incomes. Programmes such as LEADER have also encouraged the development of off-farm local enterprises.Obviously for part-time farmers the availability of off-farm jobs in the economy is extremely important and is the key to their remaining in and contributing to the development of rural communities.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The position in relation to the National Beef Assurance Scheme is that the traceability elements have been fully operational since 1 January 2000. It was envisaged that other elements of the scheme, in particular the inspection and approval of farms, would be undertaken last year in conjunction with the annual round of testing. Detailed discussions took place with the veterinary and farming representative organisations to this end and a Protocol for the conduct of inspections was agreed. However, only a small number of inspections took place because of resistance to implementation of the scheme mainly by veterinarians whose Union is seeking a centralised payment system for the costs involved. This could not be agreed as the legislation establishing the scheme specifically provides that the cost of securing approval is the responsibility of the applicant. In addition, the Exchequer has already invested in excess of €50 million in developing the traceability system and costs will continue to be accrued under this heading.Further discussions were held with the veterinary and farming representative organisations earlier this year and, while some progress was made, the main issue of payment was not resolved. Part-time farmers are also eligible the same direct payment as full-time farmers and have benefited from the increased payments under Agenda 2000. Similarly, other market support measures such as intervention and export refunds which help maintain output prices benefit both full and part-time farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	364	Supplementary measure 5 of the previous rural environmental protection scheme provided for payments to farmers who undertook to give public access to their land for environmentally friendly leisure and sporting activities. There is no supplementary measure of this kind in the new Scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000. This is because the EU regulation under which the new REP scheme is implemented, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, includes no provision for a public access measure as part of the EU co-funded agri-environment programme. The regulation governing the previous scheme did have such a provision.In an effort to secure the continued availability of public access as part of REPS, my Department made proposals to the European Commission for the inclusion of the measure in the new scheme as a State aid fully funded by the Exchequer. However the Commission took the position that a public access measure was not admissible under the agri-environment title of the Regulation, even as a State aid.Participants in the previous REP scheme who are currently in receipt of payment under supplementary measure 5 may continue to avail of payments under this measure until the end of their existing agreements.

The recommendations of that committee, which is chaired by my Department, and includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Environment and Local Government, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Enterprise Ireland, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, will be given careful consideration and will, it is hoped, contribute to a resolution of how this country should deal with its output of meat and bone meal. Part-time farmers are also eligible the same direct payment as full-time farmers and have benefited from the increased payments under Agenda 2000.

I believe that the recently agreed agriculture chapter in the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, contains a package of measures to help improve the lot of farmers. In addition, better international and national markets, a higher level of output and a better weather outlook will help their financial situation in 2003.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I requested FAPRI Ireland to look at the effects of the full mid-term review – MTR – proposals, including not just decoupling, but also degression, modulation and further reforms of the dairy and cereals sectors and to take account of the proposals submitted to World Trade Organisation by the Commission in relation to negotiations on the current world trade round. This independent study confirmed that the MTR and WTO proposals have important implications for Ireland. The analysis is provided at aggregate and farm levels.In summary FAPRI Ireland found that the Commissions MTR and WTO proposals would result in aggregate farm income at the end of the study period – 2012 – being around 8% higher than would be the case if there were no policy change or changes in the trading environment. There would be a reduction in the output value of agriculture products, but this would be offset by a reduction in input costs, resulting from lower animal numbers and more extensive production.There are important assumptions attached to the study, as with all economic studies they clearly rely upon the assumptions made, and FAPRI Ireland has clearly outlined the assumptions used.The FAPRI Ireland study is being referred to a number of consultative groups which I set up for each sector to allow for full consideration of the report and its results.Part-time farmers are also eligible the same direct payment as full-time farmers and have benefited from the increased payments under Agenda 2000. Similarly, other market support measures such as intervention and export refunds which help maintain output prices benefit both full and part-time farmers.

The recommendations of the Organic Development Committee are seen as furthering achievement of the Governments objectives for the organic sector. The recommendations are supported in my Departments action plan launched last December.A number of the committees recommendations have already been implemented. These include the establishment of a national steering group for the organic sector. This group includes representatives of the wide range of stakeholders who worked successfully together to produce the report of the Organic Development Committee itself.As the report of the Organic Development Committee made specific recommendations in the areas of training, research, education and market development, the establishment of two additional working groups was considered essential. These groups, the organic market development group and the partnership expert working group, are also up and running, and are being chaired by Bord Bia and Teagasc respectively.A number of the recommendations in the report lie directly within the remit of my Department. Areas that progress has already been made on include the development of a website and the taking of a national census of organic production. The website will be incorporated in the newly-designed Department site, which is due to be launched next month. In relation to the census, my officials are currently engaged in following up outstanding returns, and should be in a position to produce the results of the survey in July.A sub-group of the organic market development group is looking at the issue of a National Label and will report its findings in due course.

Equally, the domestic market is performing well where there is strong demand also.The question of scarcity, however, does not arise, with a 48% increase in slaughterings this year, to date, over the same period last year.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	372	EU beef labelling regulations introduced in 2000 require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their product with a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to: the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.In its report of its audit on beef labelling in Ireland, the FVO recommended, inter alia, that a formal and effective co-ordination mechanism between the different agencies charged with traceability and labelling of bovine meat and meat products be put in place and that this coordination should include a control strategy covering all the stages in the production chain.While the competent authority in Ireland for the purpose of the EU beef labelling regulations is the Department of Agriculture and Food, the State's 33 local authorities and ten health boards are also involved in so far as low capacity abattoirs and retail outlets are concerned. In January of this year the beef labelling regulations were been included in the 2003 service contract between my Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This allows for the FSAI to co-ordinate all relevant beef labelling activities between my Department, the local authorities and the health boards.A working group is being established by the FSAI which will comprise representatives of the relevant agencies. Its purpose will be to develop guidance for industry in terms of documentation and labelling required; assess the extent and frequency of inspections to be carried out by the enforcement officers; agree a system for approving traceability and beef labelling plans drawn up by the industry and develop a training programme for enforcement officers.FVO audits throughout all member states of the EU identified a number of difficulties in the implementation of the beef labelling regulations. EU member states recently considered these difficulties, and possible solutions, at a meeting with the EU Commission in Brussels earlier this month. In accordance with the requirements of the beef labelling regulations, the Commission will report to the Parliament and to Council on or before 14 August 2003 on the implementation of these regulations and will most likely introduce proposals to address those difficulties.

Most of these officers are engaged part-time in this area and also have other Departmental functions. A total of 6,662 seizures of illegally imported animal products were made during 2002 and in 2003 to date, officers of the Department have made 2,673 seizures of such products. Arrangements are made under the supervision of my Department for the safe disposal of seized material.For the purpose of the protection of public and animal health, the personal import of meat and dairy products from outside of the EU and including the accession countries and Norway, Switzerland, Greenland, Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Andorra, San Marino, and Liechtenstein has been prohibited under Commission Decision No. 2002/995/EC. This decision has been has been implemented in Ireland under Statutory Instrument No. 114 of 2003 entitled Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Control on Animal Products) Order 2003.Operators of ports and airports are required to display posters to the effect that import of animal based products from third countries are not permitted and transport operators are required to bring this information to the attention of passengers who are entering the EU. There are provisions under this legislation to permit small quantities of infant food or special food that is required for medical reasons to be imported where it is packaged as a proprietary brand product that does not require refrigeration before opening and is contained in an unbroken and unopened package.

The dairy cow premium is to be paid to producers as compensation for the reduction in market support prices proposed in the mid-term review.In relation to the milk quota itself a number of possibilities are open to the person named on the expiry of the lease: (i) the lease could be renewed for a further period with the original lessee or his-her successor; (ii) the quota could be transferred by way of sale, lease or gift with the land to which it attached to a family member as defined in the regulation provided that person is a milk producer; or (iii) the quota could be sold to a restructuring scheme – in this case it should be noted that where a person sells a milk quota into restructuring, that person's son or daughter will, subject to certain conditions, have first priority in the purchase of quota under a later restructuring scheme provided it is available.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Avian influenza, AI, is a contagious viral infection which can effect all species of birds. In intensive poultry rearing systems young fattening turkeys and laying hens are usually the most affected species. Free range birds may carry influenza viruses without becoming ill due to a natural resistance. It is known that wild waterfowl present a natural reservoir for these viruses and can be responsible for the primary introduction of infection into domestic poultry.Since 2 March, there have been outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in the Netherlands – 239 outbreaks, Belgium – eight outbreaks and Germany – one outbreak resulting in the slaughter of approximately 31 million birds.The European Commission has taken safeguard action against all of the above countries, banning the export of live poultry and hatching eggs from all of the Netherlands and Belgium and parts of Germany to other member states. I have also taken supporting national measures banning the importation into Ireland of live poultry and hatching eggs from these member states. The risk posed is minimal however, as this trade normally is at a small and insignificant level. We are monitoring the situation very carefully and will continue to play our full part in the EU response.

In the light of these efficiencies disease levies will be reviewed from 1 January 2004.I should also point out that a provision of €216 million has been made in the 2003 Estimates for Exchequer expenditure on animal disease of which €67 million relates to TB and Brucellosis eradication. At current rates, the disease levies will bring in some €20 million in 2003.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The reduction in shift allocations to temporary veterinary inspectors, TVIs, involved in the operation of the meat inspection service has not affected slaughtering throughput or supply this year. In fact total cattle slaughtering so far this year is 6% higher relative to the same period last year and sheep slaughtering is 48% higher than last year.In accordance with the budget allocation for the year, my Department has allocated TVI shifts for each meat plant for 2003. A degree of flexibility has been allowed in the allocations for the first and second quarters to enable meat plants to meet their commercial commitments, on the clear understanding that the overall annual allocation must be respected. The onus is on meat factory operators to plan their activities to maximise the efficient use of the resources available.

In the period 1994 to 2002 close on 2.27 million head of cattle were exported from Ireland. Based on information sourced from the Central Statistics Office the value of cattle exported in the period 1994 to 2001 is estimated at €731.3 million excluding EU export subsidies.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I established the Food Labelling Group in July 2002 to examine issues surrounding food labelling in the context of consumer expectations about the food they buy and to come forward with recommendations by the end of the year.The group which was widely representative of the major stakeholders in the food chain – consumer interests, industry, Government Departments and agencies – presented its report to me on 19 December 2002.The report contains 21 broad ranging recommendations, most of which will need further consultation with the European Commission, other Government Departments and agencies. The European Commission has also initiated consultation with member states as part of its current review of food labelling legislation. This report of the Food Labelling Group will form the basis of Irelands input into this process.I have established an interdepartmental agency committee to progress the recommendations contained within the report. This committee comprises Department of Agriculture and Food; Department of Health and Children; Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Food Safety Authority of Ireland; and Food Safety Promotion Board.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Our live export performance to date this year is very strong, and at 67,000 is more than double last year's performance for this stage of the year. Increased price competitiveness of Irish calves is reflected in these significantly higher levels of exports. Since the beginning of the year some 29,000 calves have been exported compared to 4,300 in the same period last year. Most of these went to the Netherlands and Spain. The Lebanon remains our main third country market for finished cattle.In recognition of the importance of live exports to Irish agriculture and to the economy generally, the function of my Department is to ensure that the animal health and welfare conditions necessary to facilitate the live export trade are fully in place. In this regard Ireland's rules in relation to the transport of cattle by sea are among the most advanced in the world and require vessels intended to be used for this purpose to undergo an approval process involving detailed examination by an independent marine surveyor and a veterinary surgeon.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The overall cost of the Meat Inspection Service has increased very substantially over the past five years and much of this cost is borne by the Exchequer. The payments for services provided by temporary veterinary inspectors at meat plants forms a major part of the overall cost.While there have been increased demands on the Meat Inspection Service as a result of new food safety requirements, there is no doubt but that the current method of delivery of the service could be improved in terms of flexibility, efficiency and responsiveness to the needs of a modern meat processing sector.I have considered a range of suggestions on how the service might be improved. My Department will shortly initiate discussions with all interested parties with a view to setting in motion a process that will lead to ensuring that the service can reach higher levels of efficiency, provide greater degrees of flexibility and make maximum use of the resources available while delivering better value for money. In any new arrangement I will ensure that the quality and safety of meat products will continue to be the main priority.

To date in 2003 my Department is aware of seven on-farm accidents, which resulted in death. Information is not yet available from the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in relation to on-farm accidents that have not resulted in death in 2003. This information is being compiled by the HSA at present and should be available shortly.The farm action safety plan was launched by the HSA at the beginning of their farm action safety week, which commenced on Monday, 7 April.The plan sets out a programme which covers the period 2003-06 and its main objectives are as follows: to reduce on farm accidents to below 2,000 per annum; to reduce on farm deaths by at least 50% over a five year period; to reduce health problems associated with farming, for example back and respiratory problems by at least 50% over a five year period; to introduce health and safety training for farmers, farm workers and students at second and third level; to ensure that all primary schools show and discuss the contents of the Childsafe video and CD-ROM prior to school holidays; that a minimum of 1,000 farm inspections be carried out by HSA inspectors each year; that farm safety promotional campaigns such as farm safety week, child safety are continued and other appropriate campaigns are undertaken; that research be carried out in order to identify methods of improving attitudes and awareness in relation to farm safety; and that a database on all farm accidents be developed.I am totally supportive of the HSA's efforts to reduce the numbers of farm accidents and its programmes to increase awareness in the area of health and safety on the farm.

This ensured an equitable basis for payment to the producer and a uniform method for reporting of prices for slaughtered animals. The weekly price data from each member state, when collated and analysed by the European Commission, provides a basis for market management decisions under the common organisation of the market. I am satisfied that the present grading system is operating satisfactorily. The accuracy of classification is routinely controlled both by supervisory staff of my own Department and also by visits from the European Commission's Carcase Control Group.

Consumer trends clearly indicate the growing importance of farmers markets and Bord Bia's strategy is to maximise the potential financial return for small food producers in selling direct to consumers. Further scope for development of farmer markets has been identified in the specialty-artisan food sector. The current market for speciality-artisan food in Europe is worth €33 billion with an estimated 9% being sold through a network of farmer markets. These markets will have an important role to play in increasing sales of Irish speciality-artisan food sales currently estimated at €450 million. In 2002, Bord Bia staged Ireland's largest ever outdoor food market based on the farmers' market style at the international food symposium in Kinsale. In excess of 110 small food producers marketed and sold their produce to over 200 national and international buyers and to the general public. Bord Bia also provides general advice and information to people who have an active interest in setting up farmers markets in urban and rural areas.The report of the organic development committee, which I established on foot of a recommendation of the AgriFood 2010 Committee, recognised the importance of farmer co-operatives and producer groups in developing the organic sector. The committee recommended the establishment of an organic market development group. My Department is participating in the work of this group, which is chaired by Bord Bia and has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food. I expect that the group will further explore the potential of farmers markets as an outlet for organic produce.My Department has also provided financial assistance to the Irish Countrywomen's Association for work performed by Country Markets Limited in developing co-operative markets for the sale of farm, garden and home produce in rural areas. This assistance has been provided directly to Country Markets Limited since 1997.

Further consideration will be given to this issue on receipt of the responses from the industry and following consultations with the farming organisations. However, any solution in relation to the electronic tagging of bovine animals will require to be compatible with that which is determined generally in EU member states.I have no plans at present to introduce electronic tagging for other species but this option will be kept under review in the light, in particular, of future technological advances and cost developments. As part of its statutory role in promoting the development of Ireland's food and drink industry, Bord Bia is actively working with small food producers to develop this pioneering route to market.

Any complaint received by my Department about on-farm animal welfare is investigated under these regulations and appropriate follow-up action is taken. Where warranted this may include initiating prosecutions. The Garda, with the support as required of my Department, also investigates farm animal welfare cases under the Protection of Animals Act 1911. In addition, the welfare of calves and pigs is subject to more detailed legislation, namely the European Communities (Welfare of Calves and Pigs) Regulations 2003, and laying hens are subject to the provisions of the European Communities (Welfare of Laying Hens) Regulations 2002. Routine welfare inspections under the above-mentioned regulations are undertaken on an annual and random basis. The outcome of these inspections is reported to the European Commission.An annual inspection on the welfare of farm animals during transport is undertaken on a national spot-check basis at meat factories, marts and ports, under the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals During Transport) Order 1995 as amended. Equally this legislation provides for the welfare of farm animals during international transport. Each international consignment is subjected to a health and welfare check. The outcome of all inspections under this legislation is also reported to the European Commission on a yearly basis.The welfare of animals at the time of slaughter is governed by the Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter Regulations 1995. Veterinary inspectors are responsible for ensuring that the highest standards of animal welfare apply at all slaughtering plants in compliance with these regulations. Checks are carried out on a daily basis by the veterinary inspector on livestock unloading procedures, intake procedures, lairage facilities and handling, movement to stunning area, stunning procedures and ritual slaughter. In addition, inspections are made on the transport vehicles that bring animals to the plant. In the event that welfare is compromised enforcement action is initiated including, if necessary suspension of slaughter or de-commissioning of a transport vehicle.I attach considerable importance to the area of animal welfare and have taken a number of recent initiatives in this area, including establishing the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, with a view to promoting and sustaining good practice and compliance with all of the relevant standards, whether on-farm, during transport or at time of slaughter.

However, its suitability for the disposal of various categories of animal by-products has been assessed by the EU's Scientific Steering Committee which published an opinion on the matter on following its meeting on 10 and 11 April 2003.While the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee on category 2 and category 3 animal waste is clear, its opinion on the suitability of alkaline hydrolysis for the disposal of BSE-positive material is less certain. Indeed it is possible that the EU Commission would require BSE-positive material treated with alkaline hydrolysis to be incinerated or buried, disposal solutions which are already permitted under EU law for rendered BSE-positive material.The matter will be discussed at Commission working group level shortly and officials from my Department will participate in these discussions. I have indicated on a number of occasions that I am keeping an open mind on possible methods for the disposal of BSE-positive material.However, any method proposed must in the first instance be approved by the EU Commission, must meet Irish environmental and waste disposal standards and must be reasonably practicable. I will continue to follow ongoing debate at EU level on alkaline hydrolysis with interest, and I can assure the Deputy that I will give it or any other practical solution for the disposal of BSE-positive material due consideration as soon as all of the necessary environmental and other approvals are obtained. It goes without saying that I am anxious to have as many approved disposal options as possible.

The purpose of the visit was to develop closer linkages between the growing Irish functional food sector and that of Japan, a country with acknowledged expertise and experience in the field and regarded as a world leader in this sector.The visit was organised by Enterprise Ireland and formed a key part of the Government's strategy to develop the functional foods sector in Ireland. Further development of products which fall into this category are an essential part of the move towards greater value added food production in this country and the visit exposed some of the leading Irish companies to the potential offered in this area. The Irish delegation met with many of the leading Japanese dairy and functional foods companies and Government bodies, as well as visiting a number of research institutes.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The main dairy products produced in Ireland for export are butter, cheese, milk powders and casein. These products are exported world-wide, with the European Union countries accounting for the majority of these sales.While the dairy industry in Ireland has been extremely successful over the years in developing and maintaining export markets, and has shown itself to be competitive when up against other exporting countries, this is something which cannot be taken for granted. The industry must, therefore, ensure that its structure, its product range and its marketing strength are continually measured against those of its main competitors, both within and outside the EU. The Prospectus study identified areas which require attention in order to maintain international competitiveness and it is essential that these are addressed by the industry in order to ensure Ireland maintains its position as a major dairy exporter.My Department does not compile statistics on the prices of Irish dairy products on other markets nor on prices of products originating elsewhere.

I am informed by An Bord Bia that Irish lamb exported to France is generally making €5 per kg. delivered, similar to the price of British lamb there. Spanish lamb is of lesser quality and is making around €4.60 per kg. French domestically-produced lamb traditionally commands a higher price than imported lamb due to a preference for locally produced product and is currently at a level of €5.34 per kg.The principal source of lamb imported into the EU is New Zealand. This is mainly supplied in frozen form and the current representative price on the UK, Smithfield market is €3 per kg.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The outlook for the cereals sector in Ireland is reasonably positive, with an expected rise in prices due to reduced supplies in Europe and the general trend for a long-term rise in world prices. Average grain production in the country over a number of years has been in the region of two million tonnes. It is desirable to maintain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported grain. Furthermore, under normal conditions, yields in this country are among the highest in Europe and also higher than in the USA. The introduction of a tariff rate quota for low-medium quality wheat and barley, from the beginning of 2003, has helped to stem the flow of cheap imports into the Community from certain eastern European countries.Prices in Ireland are currently the highest in Northern Europe and are comfortably above the intervention rate, currently 20% above the basic intervention price, compared with other member states where prices are at, or below, the intervention rate, resulting in almost one million tonnes of cereals being sold into intervention across the Community in the past two months. Currently there are no stocks of cereals in intervention storage in Ireland.In relation to the mid term review of Agenda 2000 and the WTO, I have commissioned a study by FAPRI Ireland to examine the effects of the MTR on all sectors, including the cereals sector. The FAPRI study found that the effect of the MTR proposals, and of the proposals submitted to the WTO by the Commission on the cereals sector, would not be significant.

Over the last eight years the success of Irish bred event horses has maintained the Irish Sport Horse Stud Book as the leading stud book in eventing with the World Breeding Federation. In show jumping terms the Irish Sport Horse Stud Book is eighth in the world.The Irish Horse Board Co-operative Society, IHB, is a breeders organisation which maintains the stud book and develops breeding programmes. My Department will provide €560,000 to the IHB in 2003 to assist it in defraying the costs associated with the administration of the organisation itself, the operation of the Irish Horse Register, the stud book for non-thoroughbred horses, and the development of the Irish sport horse breeding and production sector. The IHB also administers a range of equine schemes funded by my Department under the National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006.

While the main source of imports of petfoods is from other member states of the European Union it is also imported under licence from Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Poland and USA.Importers of petfoods are required to register with my Department and give at least 25 hours notice of intention to import. In the case of petfood originating from an EU source it must come from an approved establishment and be accompanied to its destination with a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian on the competent authority of the member state of origin. In the case of importation from third countries it can only be imported under licence. In such cases it must originate in an approved country for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment and be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance the provisions of Community legislation.

Other animals which were slaughtered on a precautionary basis were rendered and the resultant meat and bone meal was exported for incineration.Similarly, the carcases of animals slaughtered under the purchase for destruction scheme were rendered. Most of the meat and bone meal generated has been exported for incineration and arrangements are being made for the export of the remaining amounts which are at present kept in secure stores pending export for destruction.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Payments valued at over €1.58 billion have issued to farmers since 1 January 2002 under the suckler cow premium, special beef premium, slaughter premium, ewe premium, arable aid, extensification premium and disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance schemes, of which €1.11 billion relates to payments made under the 2002 schemes.To date 98% of 2002 ewe premium applicants, 97% of disadvantaged areas compensatory allowance applicants and 99.8% of arable aid applicants have received their full entitlements.Advance payments under the 2002 suckler cow premium, special beef premium and slaughter premium schemes were made at the rate of 80% of full premium and to date 98% of applicants for each of these schemes have been paid their advances. Balancing payments commenced on 30 April and to date, 86% of suckler cow premium applicants, 80% of special beef premium applicants and 78% of slaughter premium applicants have been paid.Some cases remain unpaid and this is mainly due to the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes with effect from the 2002 scheme year and also because of problems with the overshoot of the special beef premium national quota. While the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes under the integrated administration and control system amending Regulation 2419/2001 will mean later balancing payments for 2002 and future years, the penalties that will be applied to these schemes for irregularities and late lodgement of area aid applications will be much lighter than those that applied up to now.Payments under the 2002 extensification premium are due to commence next month. It is expected that the vast majority of these payments will be issued during the month.

As a nation Ireland is one of the most export orientated exporting up to 80% of our agricultural production. The prices received by producers and obtained with retail establishments are dependent on the location of the market, the degree of processing and refinement of the product, the sales or tax regime in place and similar factors. For these reasons among others there is no official database of price differences.Information received from EUROSTAT and published in my Department's annual review and outlook 2002-03 for comparative price levels at retail level in the EU for 2001 would indicate the following price differentials between member states for certain products. The EU average is 100 in each case:

EU enlargement has paved the way for another 106 million consumers to join the single market, thus further increasing the importance of this market for Irish exporters.The identification of new market opportunities is essentially a matter for the industry. However, my Department maintains close contact with the industry to assist in overcoming potential barriers to trade, forging new trade links, and developing effective international relationships.In the course of the past year Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have lifted their bans on the importation of Irish beef. My Department, together with An Bord Bia, continues to make intensive efforts to open other important markets such as the Gulf States, South Africa and Indonesia. In the case of pigmeat, the Japanese and Korean markets were reopened in the past year while attempts to negotiate access to the Chinese and Australian markets are ongoing. The EU is a deficit area for sheepmeat, being a net importer of lamb and consequently exports to non-EU countries do not arise.

In March the council put the proposal on public display and members of the public have until 27 May to submit observations to it. I expect the council will consider the matter at its monthly meeting in June. The Office of Public Works must await the approval of the council before any works can commence. Once approval is given the Office of Public Works will start work immediately in the area.The works to be undertaken are expected to cost in the region of €300,000. Not all of the works in the interim report are being carried out at this time due to, among other things, time constraints and environmental considerations. It is also necessary to be mindful that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due this summer. It should provide additional information on which further decisions on the entire catchment can be made.

President Mugabe's land reform process and the illegal land seizures which have accompanied same have had a devastating economic and humanitarian effect on the entire population.The Government has no plans to invite Zimbabwean farmers who have been forced off their land to come to Ireland. Irish citizens who reside in Zimbabwe are entitled to come here. The inequalities of land ownership in Zimbabwe can only be resolved within an acceptable legal and economic framework. I condemn the human rights abuses which have taken place in Zimbabwe and I support the EU decision to renew sanctions on those who are principally responsible for such violations. The acceptable solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe is the restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law.

The grants are intended to contribute to the general operating costs of national schools, including heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years – the standard rate increased from €57.14 in 1997 to €111.58 in 2003, an increase of 95% in the capitation grant. Local authority service and other charges payable to the local authorities do not come within the remit of the Department. The local authorities decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost forms part of the normal running costs of schools and falls to be met from the capitation funding received by schools from the Department. It is not feasible for the Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water or refuse charges.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I am aware of concerns that have been expressed by school authorities about increased insurance costs. At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of per capita grants may be used for this purpose. Grant aid to secondary schools is provided by my Department by way of per capita grant and may be used towards insurance costs.Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard per capita grant of €224.74 that applied in 1997 was increased to €266.49 in this school year. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools, bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools will benefit from further significant increases in the support grant from €25.40 per pupil to €99 per pupil over this school year. Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce historic anomalies in funding arrangements for the different second level school types.Under the terms of a recent equalisation measure, the support services grant was further increased by €28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brought the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to €116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to €127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school –€ 44.44 per pupil – per annum that was approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €100,000 per annum and annual grants of €236,761 –€255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools – towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.

The overall enrolment trend in schools in the Killinarden area is downward. However, in light of the proposed additional housing in the area, my Department will continue to monitor developments and any needs identified will be addressed by increasing existing school capacity or through new school provision, as appropriate.

As part of this process, the Minister for Education and Science is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans. My Department monitors these plans and meets local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision.Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure there is adequate existing provision or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity where necessary. Liaison with existing schools is an important part of the process, as the school authorities usually alert my Department when, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. In addition, standing arrangements are in place for officials of my Department's planning and building unit to meet on a regular basis with officials of the four Dublin local authorities to discuss development proposals and consequent site requirements for new schools. My Department is currently concentrating on the areas of major development and population growth with a view to identifying where the most urgent need for new or additional educational facilities exists or is likely to arise in the future.

A total of 2,350 schools, which are participating in Giving Children An Even Break, are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre in March and April 2000, at my Department's request. The aim of the survey was to gain an indication of the level of disadvantage in each school using principals' responses to a questionnaire comprised of items relating to disadvantage.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. An independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals to ensure transparency and openness in the system. The staffing at Holy Child senior girls' school for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board. Having considered the appeal with regard to criteria outlined in Department circular 19/02, the board was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The school's board of management was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 10 April. The appeals board's decision is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.This school is among 2,350 primary schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break, which is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children who are at risk of school failure or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. Schools receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in schools invited to participate in the programme. The levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre in March and April 2000 at the request of my Department.The aim of the survey was to gain an indication of the level of disadvantage in each school using principals' responses to a questionnaire comprised of items relating to disadvantage. Resources were allocated to schools on a sliding scale and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were allocated proportionately more resources than those with fewer numbers of such pupils. In the urban dimension, schools identified as having the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage were considered for additional staffing to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth class.Based on data supplied for the ERC survey by the school to which the Deputy refers, the school was selected in 2001 for inclusion in this category. It was allocated additional funding based on the percentage of disadvantaged pupils. Unfortunately, the school overstated the levels of disadvantage on the survey form which resulted in a miscalculation of points by the ERC. The ERC re-examined the data supplied and calculated the correct points total in respect of the school. The new total is lower than that on which the original level of staffing and funding allocation was based. Consequently, the posts allocated to the school will be suppressed at the end of the 2002-03 school year and the teachers in question will be placed on the diocesan teaching panel.

My Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years to accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector. Under the national development plan, 1994-99, and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available in 1999 to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value of €70 million, both public and private funding, were supported and are now completed. Two of the projects funded under this measure were undertaken by Esat and Ocean and they resulted in fibre optic cable being installed in Galway.

The board allocates commercial fishing licences in accordance with the criteria laid down under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders 1980 to 1997. As my Department has no role in the allocation of such licences, I have forwarded the Deputy's query to the chief executive officer of the board and asked him to reply directly in the matter.

The grant was subject to the terms and conditions of the programme, among which was a requirement, in the case of a grant of more than €80,000, to legally insure for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. This legal agreement is invoked by my Department's legal advisers, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. In my reply to Question No. 374 on this project on 25 March 2003, I advised the Deputy that the CSSO was awaiting a reply to a letter sent to the club's solicitor on 18 February. The CSSO is still awaiting a reply to this letter. I understand the club's solicitor in turn submitted the letter to the legal department of Dublin City Council. The CSSO is not in a position to proceed until the legal documentation requested has been supplied. Payment of the grant can only proceed when this matter is resolved.

Since 1997, additional revenue funding of approximately €178 million has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services. This includes an additional €8 million for 2003. This has provided for a wide range of developments, including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community-based services. About €40 million in capital funding has been made available by the Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of non-offending children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to more than 120. This includes an additional five-place special care unit for boys which has been completed and is due to come on stream on a phased basis in the Mid-Western Health Board later this year.While health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably trained staff for these services, progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced in 2001. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level. From time to time, health boards have also put in place individual high support packages to meet the specific needs of children. Many intensive community-based services, such as the youth advocacy pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board which commenced last year, have also been put in place to provide for the needs of this group of children.

Responsibility for human resource planning, including the monitoring and filling of vacant psychologist posts in each health board region, rests with the chief executive officer of each board. In managing the workforce in his-her region, each chief executive officer is responsible for determining the appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed in line with service plan priorities, subject to overall employment levels remaining within the approved regional employment ceiling. My Department has therefore requested information from the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority on the number of vacancies that exist for clinical psychologists and this information will be sent to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

For the purposes of these regulations, "means" are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of the person's spouse. In calculating the means of an applicant, Paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule provides that a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including income from rentals. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	472	A person in need of extended care may apply to his or her local health board for admission to a public long-stay facility. Admittance to such a facility is based primarily on medical need. Alternatively, such a person may decide to seek care in a private nursing home and to apply for a subvention towards the cost of that care.Charges for extended care in a public long-stay facility can be made under two sets of regulations, the first of which is the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days in the previous 12 months. The regulations provide that a charge is made at a rate not exceeding the person's income. Medical card holders and persons with dependants are exempt from these charges.Charges may also be made under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1965 where the patient receives "shelter and maintenance" rather than treatment. These charges apply from the date of admission and are payable by all patients who are in receipt of incomes, including medical card holders and persons with dependants. In deciding the amount to be contributed, health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.The role of the health boards in private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 is twofold – first, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes and, second, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a subvention will be payable only if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations 1993.With the exception of persons applying for subvention, following determination by the chief executive officer of a health board under Article 4.3 of the subvention regulations, a person must apply for a subvention prior to entering a private nursing home. Article 11.1 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations provide that a decision on payment and the amount to be paid must be advised to the applicant within eight weeks of the completed application. It is also open to a person to request that a board outline the charges to be imposed on a patient prior to admittance to a health board extended care facility.

In Dublin, in addition to funding from local authority resources, co-funding for local authority traffic calming schemes has been made available in the past from traffic management grant funding administered by the Dublin Transportation Office. In 2002, grant funding of €2.25 million was provided to local authorities for traffic calming schemes. The determination of priorities for the allocation of grants from traffic management funding is carried out by the traffic management grants committee of the DTO and approved by the steering committee. Local authorities are represented on both of these committees.Priorities for the allocation of funding in 2003 were determined by the need to further implement the traffic management elements of Platform for Change. They included the expansion and improvement of the quality bus network, provision and improvement of cycle routes and pedestrian routes, planning and implementation of environmental traffic cells and facilities for people with disabilities, drawing up of integrated land use and transport framework plans and the carrying out of regional transport projects and studies.

It does not grant permission to enter or remain in Ireland. The date of validity shown on a visa indicates only the date before which it must be presented to an immigration officer at the port of entry. Immigration officers have the authority to grant or deny admission and to decide on the length of stay in the State.With regard to student visas, my Department has for a number of years had in place a set of detailed student visa guidelines. These have been circulated to relevant education institutions and are also available on my Department's website. They are intended to assist frequent and high volume users of the student visa scheme. In general terms, however, the principal criteria applied are that the prospective student should have enrolled in a full-time course of study, should have paid fees in full for that course and should have evidence that they have sufficient funds to support themselves during their stay in the State.Where such persons intend to stay for longer than 90 days, they are required to register with the Garda registration office for the area in which they intend to reside. The standard practice is for the registration office to grant permission to remain in the State for the duration of the course, up to a maximum of one year at a time. It is possible to obtain an extension of permission to remain in order to continue with the course of study or to move to a new course, provided the above criteria continue to be met. During 2000, an additional requirement was introduced whereby students seeking a renewal of permission to remain are now required to provide a letter from their college certifying that their attendance over the preceding period has been satisfactory; attendance of 80% or more is regarded as satisfactory. In general these arrangements are working well and facilitate the many thousands of genuine students who wish to study in Ireland.

Garda personnel assist with identification marking of pedal cycles which subsequently facilitates identification of the owner if the pedal cycle is stolen and recovered.Every stolen pedal cycle that is subsequently recovered is recorded on the PULSE system. This has proven to be a very effective aid to restoring pedal cycles to their owners.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The reference to the 15 local authorities in the reply to Question No. 323 of 10 April, 2003 related only to the grant category – non-national roads to support housing and other development. The aim of this Exchequer-funded investment programme is to provide grant assistance for certain strategic non-national roads required to open up land for housing development in local authorities comprised of, or adjacent to, the most densely populated areas of the country where housing needs are greatest.A total of 48 schemes in 15 local authorities were approved for funding in December 2000 under this programme. A maximum qualifying grant of 75% of the estimated cost of each scheme was approved at the time and details of the payments made in 2001 and 2002 and the allocations for 2003 to each of the 15 local authorities under this programme, are set out in the following table:Non-National Roads Grants to Facilitate Housing and Other Related Developments 2001 – 2003

In each case, the Garda were informed, the items were registered in the art loss register and details were submitted to the Antiques Trade Gazette.I consider that it would not be appropriate to put details of the security measures at each property into the public domain, but I am satisfied that appropriate security measures are in place to guard against future such incidences. No prosecutions have taken place or are outstanding.

The application in this case was received subsequent to that date and a new house grant cannot therefore be allowed.The conditions relating to the termination of the scheme were published in the main daily newspapers on 15 November and again on 29 November, and on the Department's website. Neither the Revenue Commissioners nor the lending institutions have been involved in the administration of the new house grant scheme.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	505	First-time buyers purchase both new and second-hand houses. My Department does not have information on all purchases by first-time buyers, but the trend in the number of new house grants paid my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for that period, is an important indicator of activity of first-time buyers in the market. In 2002, there was a total of 10,522 new house grants paid. These 2002 figures are not directly comparable with the Revenue Commissioners data which is based on mortgage interest relief given to first-time buyers of new and second-hand houses combined.My Department also collects information from lending institutions, which are completed by mortgage applicants on a voluntary basis. This gives indicative data on all house purchasers including first-time buyers. My Department has recently appointed consultants to develop and implement a new house price statistics system which will provide more comprehensive housing statistics.

Funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who identify elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.Under the terms of the scheme, grants are provided towards the cost of small-scale physical security equipment and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the panic button pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone.Funding is not available for conventional intruder alarms. Any amendment of the terms of the scheme in this regard would have to be considered in the context of available resources. I hope to announce details of the scheme for 2003 in July, which will be advertised in both the national and provincial papers.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-22 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the responsibility of each health board. In relation to rent supplements, in addition to the completion of the appropriate application forms other documents such as rent books-receipts or a copy of the lease agreement may be requested by the health board in order to determine that a bona fide tenancy exists in respect of the accommodation for which the rent supplement is sought. It may also be appropriate to obtain confirmation from landlords of details supplied by claimants. It is a matter for the health board to decide on the level of verification it requires for this purpose.I am satisfied that the process currently used by the health boards to verify tenancies for the purpose of rent supplement is reasonable.
