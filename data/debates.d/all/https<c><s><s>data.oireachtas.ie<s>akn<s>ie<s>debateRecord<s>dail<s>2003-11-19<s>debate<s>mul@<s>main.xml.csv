#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I note this morning that the Government has finally decided to move to implementation stage of the Hanly report, one month after its acceptance by Government. Will the Taoiseach explain to the House and to the country what is meant by the implementation phase? What is the strategy on a month by month basis whereby the effects of the implementation will be seen? What moneys are included in next year's Estimates for implementation of the report? Is the sum of €110 million for consultants, referred to in the last paragraph of the report, included in the Estimates for next year?The Taoiseach must be aware that the European working time directive and the Hanly report are two separate entities. The Taoiseach now has ten months within which to implement the European working time directive with apparently no moneys included in the Estimates to allow for it. It was reported yesterday that ambulance response exceeds the 20 minutes response required to deal with urgent cases. It is clear that the national infrastructure, be it roads, helicopters or ambulance service, cannot deal with the implications of the Hanly report. Will the Taoiseach state the Government's strategy for the implementation of the report? Will he clarify his qualification of "demographics" and "geographics" in the context of Nenagh and Ennis hospitals? Last night's "Prime Time" programme stated that shutdown faces both of these and other hospitals. Is it true that implementation of the report on the basis of what the Government envisages means that the downgrading of a great number of hospitals will happen but the upgrading of others never will?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I am glad to deal with this matter again. As I have stated repeatedly, any reform procedures announced by the Government regarding the Brennan, Prospectus or Hanly reports do not involve the closure of any hospitals anywhere. The overall health strategy, in particular the Hanly report aspect of it, is a ten-year  plan. It will mean a better outcome for patients, better quality hospital service and a significant increase in the number of consultants available to see patients promptly and treat them with the help of the non-consultant hospital doctors, the junior doctors, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It will require substantial change in the contracts for hospital doctors and that is part of the reform.Safer provision of services by non-consultant hospital doctors is required. They will no longer be required to work excessively long hours. They were working 80 and 90 hours a week. The Minister came to a financial arrangement with them to bring the hours down to 75 hours a week and those hours must come down to 48 hours a week in the future. There is a better training system and career structure for junior doctors and an integrated network of acute hospitals which work closely together to meet the needs of patients in the most effective manner possible. This includes local, general and major hospitals in each region.Deputy Kenny asked about the implementation of reform. The three plans constitute an overall reform of the health services which has more than one aspect. The two pilot areas in the Hanly report are the Mid-Western Health Board, which covers Ennis and Nenagh, and the east coast area, which covers Loughlinstown hospital and St. Vincent's hospital. Implementation teams will be put in place. They will be chaired by independent chairpersons and will have full consultation with local interests, such as medical, paramedical or community groups.Phase two of the Hanly report will examine the remaining parts of the country. The implementation phase is concerned with those two groups which are now convening. That will be part of the overall implementation team for all the reforms. A sum of €10.5 billion is being provided next year and the Minister has already made large provision for the work to be done. I have been repeatedly criticised in the House for the amount of money made available by the Government for pay and improvements in the pay structure. All of these measures constitute an attempt to deal with health reform.Deputy Kenny commented on implementation of the reforms. The reduction in working hours of the non-consultant hospital doctors is to happen by 1 August 2004. The Minister for Health and Children has asked the Labour Relations Commission to convene a meeting of management and unions in order to quickly agree a process for dealing with that issue. It is under way. The implementation group comprising management and union representatives will then be established and will work intensively to find an agreement for the implementation of the reduction of working hours, including all the industrial relations elements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Taoiseach deserves a prize for the wooliness of his responses. He did not answer any of the questions I asked him about moneys being provided in next year's Estimates for infra structure or the implementation phase, as the Taoiseach calls it, of the Hanly report. I agree that the report never said there would be hospital closures but what is happening is the strangulation of hospitals by other means. In this morning's Irish Medical Times there is a report that the College of Anaesthetists will not recognise Clonmel hospital because of its inadequate facilities for training. The same happened in the case of Monaghan General hospital which was not recognised for obstetrical training because of the lack of sufficient resources and facilities.The Taoiseach stated that the second phase of the Hanly report will be implemented after the local elections next year. Bearing in mind the "Prime Time" programme last night dealing with Nenagh and Ennis, does that not mean that for Mullingar, Tullamore, Tralee, Kilkenny, Castlebar, Bantry, Mallow, Monaghan and other hospitals, the implications of the Hanly report will mean closure and downgrading of the accident and emergency departments? The question was asked in the programme whether the Taoiseach would agree with somebody travelling for treatment from Drumcondra to Longford or some point 70 or 80 miles away when the infrastructure is not in place.Is it not incredible that the Government is proceeding with this woolly, confused thinking about restructuring the health service when there is no money in the Estimates to implement the recommendations of the Brennan, Prospectus, Hanly or the primary healthcare reports?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Taoiseach said yesterday that demography and geography are as important in this context as they are in the context of the national spatial strategy, which was never debated in the House. No programme should require patients to travel, other than for specialised, super-regional or national services. If the Taoiseach continues down this path of downgrading or removing facilities from the towns I have mentioned and others, he will rue the day politically. This is not the way to go about reform. Unless resources are made available for infrastructure before contemplating such outrageous measures, the Taoiseach will regret it.

We have been through the reports of people who had thousands of meetings to see how to improve it.Deputy Kenny is right in one respect, no one is going to change anything until the facilities are ready to create a better future. That is why the Government spends so much on health, has put 30,000 extra staff in the area, dedicated an enormous amount of money to the capital programme and will spend €10.5 billion overall. We expect support from the Opposition when we try to improve the health service, something we will continue to do.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The Taoiseach may not get much support from this side of the House but he is getting more from us than from those behind him.Yesterday the Taoiseach dismissed the impact of cuts of €58 million in the social welfare allocation that will affect the most defenceless in our society at the same time as he increased the allocation to the horse racing industry to €67 million. I remind the Taoiseach about what happened on 23 May 1997. That day, the leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, launched the PD programme where she stated that she would stop the rent allowance to lone parents. On 24 May, the Taoiseach, as leader of Fianna Fáil disabused her of the notion. He said that Fianna Fáil would not  wear the idea in Government and would continue the policies of the rainbow Government to facilitate lone parents into employment.Six years later, the Progressive Democrats have achieved their objective, with rent allowance and rent supplement effectively stopped. The new hurdles are insurmountable for most people who cannot get public housing. The transitional half rate social welfare payment and back to education allowance for access to third level education have been effectively stopped for lone parents. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has a list with 13 other cuts. The Progressive Democrats got their way.The purpose of the transitional payment was to facilitate the entry into the workforce of lone parents and the purpose of the back to education allowance was to help them into education and, thence, into work. What has happened? The changes that have been made will keep those people at home or force them into mobile homes in the back garden or on to the streets. Instead of encouraging people to better themselves and raise their families from the poverty line, the Government is, as the president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Mr. John Monaghan, said, encouraging poverty traps by keeping lone parents in circumstances where they cannot get back into the workforce.Those are only three of the 16 cuts made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs under this left of centre Taoiseach. The only centre he is left of is the Punchestown centre, which certainly came from left field in a ready up between the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance.

The minimum contribution that all recipients of supplementary rent allowance and mortgage supplements are required to make towards their accommodation will be increased by €1 per week to €13. The supplementary welfare allowance is not payable to those in full-time employment. In future, as the Minister has pointed out, if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both are excluded from claiming for rent or a mortgage.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The idea that this is hitting people at the lowest rates is not true. I cannot give all the details in two minutes, but the Government will continue to look after those on the lowest social welfare rates. Any changes the Minister makes will move money from the higher levels to the lower levels so that, even with unemployment at 4.4%, at half the European average and far lower than in any other country, we are continuing this year to devote record resources to social welfare, as we have done every year since 1997.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The Taoiseach is now using words like "review" and "adjustment". These are not reviews or adjustments. These are real cuts, and the Taoiseach knows that very well. There is no point in talking about the number of people who are now benefiting from rent allowance or rental supplement. The reason is that the social housing provision is entirely inadequate. These are people who cannot qualify for social housing because the houses are not available. The Taoiseach has now done what the leader of the Progressive Democrats tried to get him to do in 1997, and he has made 13 other cuts on top of that.Why are the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Children's Rights Alliance and other organisations drawing to the Taoiseach's attention the fact that he is re-encouraging the creation of poverty traps if there have not been real cuts? There have been real cuts not just in terms of the three areas I mentioned but in a range of other areas, including the dietary allowance for people on social welfare, the reduction of 11 weeks for people on unemployment benefit unless they have more than five years' stamps and several other changes. These are real cuts at a time when the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has increased the allocation for the prize fund at the races.

The facts are that €10.65 billion is being spent on social welfare. As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs pointed out, there are small areas where we can tighten up the system and she has loosened up the system in other areas.The argument on social housing does not wash. We are spending €1.9 billion on social housing. The recent report on the mid-term review stated that we are at the upper end, in terms of what we are doing in that sector of the market, and we are continuing—

Last week in the Dáil, the Government voted down a Sinn Féin Bill that sought to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution. During the course of that debate, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, vigorously sought to defend the Government's record on housing and in the course of his contribution, he stated: "The general strategy for realising the overall policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves with the aid of available fiscal incentives, and that those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or [I wish to emphasise this aspect] income support to rent private housing."  Two days later, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, announced changes to the rent supplement scheme which have caused distress to vulnerable people throughout this State. In defending those changes on RTE radio, the Minister stated that rent supplement is "not a housing measure". Which Minister is right? Is it the Minister for housing, who claims that rent supplement is a housing measure when he needs to defend the Government's scandalous record on housing, or is it the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who says it is not when she needs to excuse a housing cutback which clearly has affected the most vulnerable and the poorest in our society?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	68	As I have already said, one of the conditions for the receipt of rent supplement is that the tenant must be in need of accommodation and unable to provide it from their own resources. For the most part, health boards decide, without reference to the local authority, whether an applicant for rent supplement is in need of accommodation. The State has set up local housing authorities to decide who should get State support in respect of housing but some people effectively bypass the system by opting to claim the rent supplement directly. That is what happened. As I said previously in reply to Deputy Rabbitte, in future rent supplement claimants will be referred to the local authority for assessment of their housing need. It is an attempt to deal with the matter in a more systematic manner.This measure will lead to an increased role for local authorities in this area. In addition, they will consider ways of improving the service for people with long-term housing needs who are currently in discussions with the local authorities. That is the right way to do it. Rent supplements will no longer be paid to people who refuse an offer of local authority accommodation or who leave local authority accommodation without reasonable cause. We cannot have a position where the State  is paying enormously high rents to private landlords in cases where local authority accommodation is available.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	70	We are spending almost €1.9 billion on social and affordable housing and we cannot have a situation where we just have a benchmark of resources where private landlords can increase the rent in areas to the level of the threshold for rent supplements. That cannot continue. It is giving an incentive to landlords to increase the rent which the State will have to pay. That is what happens. I see it every day in my own constituency and in other areas of the country also.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I would say to Deputy Ó Caoláin that for the past 16 years we have delivered the highest level of local authority completions, with output from all social and affordable measures enabling the needs of some 12,700 households to be met. It is expected that the needs of approximately 13,000 households will be met this year and that will be maintained next year. We are also maintaining strong social housing programmes to meet the needs of those not in a position to meet their own housing need. That was stated last week by the Minister of State responsible. Also, a number of these issues will be touched on later today by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan.

However, dealing with the issue of the changes in the rent supplement criteria, is it not a reckless and callous cut that takes no account of the hardship and indeed the danger that many families, and particularly young children, will be placed in as a result? Is it not the case that the Government has failed to take into account the damaging effects on ordinary people – people trying to leave abusive homes, single parents trying to cope with the challenges of parenthood alone and those who are trying to find a way out of overcrowded accommodation where, generationally, multiples of families are living under the one roof, sometimes one, two and three distinguishable family units? That comes on top of the imposition of the ceiling of €107 per week for rent supplement. That does not take into account the real cost of private rented sector accommodation anywhere on this island.

The rent supplement scheme is not being abused by those in receipt of the payment, but by those who subsequently benefit from it, who do not face any restrictions and who, as landlords, continue to exploit the most vulnerable and the poorest in our society.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	102	As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions recently, I met Mr. Tom Botts of Shell on 19 September 2003. The meeting took place in my Department. Mr. Botts was accompanied by three colleagues from  Shell Ireland. I was accompanied by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and one official from each of our respective Departments.The purpose of the meeting was to hear the company's concerns about progress on the Corrib gas project. During the meeting I acknowledged the importance of this project to the country, the scale of the investment already made by Shell and the difficult decision the company now faces in deciding whether to invest further in the project. I advised them that, were they to proceed, they should submit a new planning application under existing legislation.My Department has not had any follow-up meetings with Shell, although my officials monitor developments on the project in conjunction with their colleagues in the relevant line Departments. On 14 November Shell wrote to my Department informing us that it hopes to submit a new application to Mayo County Council before the end of the year, subject to the satisfactory completion of ongoing feasibility studies and related public consultation. I understand that letter was also sent to other Departments and Deputies on both sides of the House.

There is some discrepancy in that regard.Who requested the meeting? Was it at the request of Shell? Who raised the issue of the national infrastructure Bill, as it has been called? What was the specific role of the two Ministers who accompanied him to that meeting?Does the Taoiseach agree it was inappropriate that the terminal for the Corrib gas supply, which was refused planning permission, was discussed with the president and owner of the company which, through its subsidiary, Enterprise Energy, stands to benefit hugely from this gas discovery off our western seaboard? Does the Taoiseach believe his actions in this case were unethical and inappropriate? Will he explain the detail of the specific questions I put to the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The meeting, which I believe was on a Friday or another working day, was in my office. I was accompanied by the two relevant Ministers and other officials. Full minutes of the meeting were taken, which I think took place on 19 September. It was attended by myself, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and one official from each of the three Departments. Mr. Tom Botts, the chief executive officer of Shell Exploration and Production in Europe, Mr. Andy Pyle of Shell Enterprise Energy Ireland, Mr. John Dunne of Shell Ireland and Ms Rosemary Steen of Shell Enterprise Ireland were also in attendance. The meeting did not take place while the process was ongoing. The application had been refused by An Bord Pleanála and the matter was closed. Part of their consideration was whether Shell world-wide would continue to put further resources into this project. They were reporting back to their world-wide board meeting which would consider whether, in the context of the 2004-2005 estimates, would put resources into this project.Shell is a respected company throughout the world, not only in this part of it. When representatives of corporate business come here from different parts of the world I endeavour to meet them, just as I do my best to meet trade union leaders, politicians and so on. The company has  already invested more than €50 million in this project. Whatever one thinks of the project one must admit the resources invested in this country by companies such as Shell are significant. When large companies seek a meeting it behoves me or one of my Ministers to arrange this.The Deputy asked why I met the delegation. I offered to meet representatives following a letter from the company which expressed its concerns about the project and requested a meeting. The project is an important one and significant resources have been invested in it, so it was important that I heard the views of the company. I confirmed that the Government was considering reform to help speed up the delivery of critical national infrastructure but, as I have said here previously, I did not discuss the details of any possible legislation. I made it clear that the Government had not made its final decision on the legislation and suggested that Shell would be better off to proceed under existing legislation, as I have also stated in the House. I cannot comment on the application of legislation which has not been approved by the Government or debated in the House and I made that clear to the representatives at our meeting.I find it extraordinary that the Deputy thinks any of my actions in this matter were unethical. I have had a fair few meetings over the years that might border on the unethical, but I am not guilty of it in this case.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It is tempting to ask about the other meetings which the Taoiseach thinks were ethically borderline, but we will leave that for another day. I am not sure whether the Ogoni people in Nigeria share his high opinion of Shell but, leaving that aside, will the Taoiseach agree it is important that if he is to have such meetings he should also meet with independent exploration experts? They are telling us what Shell will not – that in ten to 30 years we will enter a period of rising costs for gas resources due to supply decline. The capital asset of gas resources will  then be needed to construct sustainable energy systems.Will the Taoiseach be amenable to meetings with people who are independent in their views rather than commercially driven? Companies such as Shell want to take as much profit as possible – which they can offset against tax at 100% – out of the country. Shell is not motivated by charity. It will do very well out of this. Does the Taoiseach recognise that there is no regional or national benefit in allowing this resource to be taken out of the country? In about 15 years we will really need it, but it will be gone. Will the Taoiseach consider the long-term perspective and agree to meet independent people with a longer view than Shell's?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and his Department do take the long-term view on energy supply. They also take independent advice where available, while commercial interests put forward their own cases. The Department has been known through the years for taking account of the national interest and no one could accuse it of acting otherwise.Gas is a clean source of energy.

Obviously a commercial company with world boards, investors, shareholders and pension funds to consider does not come to this country out of charity – I am not saying that. However, multinational companies, of which thankfully there are many in this country, provide employment and pay their taxes.

Has he – or the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or the Minister for the Envir onment, Heritage and Local Government, who also met with the delegation from Shell – had any further contact, either directly or in writing, with the president of Shell regarding the matters discussed?Does the Taoiseach agree that instead of selling off such important State resources to companies such as Shell, it would be better to have a radical revision of the licensing and revenue structure which governs this sector? We need to see major reform under which the State's 50% stake in all oil and gas deposits is restored. The Taoiseach mentioned that Shell was a tax contributor, but would it not be better if companies such as Shell paid the same rate of corporation tax as all other companies instead of receiving preferential treatment as they currently do?The best option would be for the gas from the Corrib field to be piped into an all-Ireland grid. Those of more informed opinion than I have suggested that to do otherwise would result in a significant reduction in the supply of natural gas to consumers throughout the island of Ireland.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I do not agree with the Deputy's last point. At the moment we are at the end of a pipeline that gives us access to almost unlimited amounts of gas from Russia. Those who know more about this than I do can see the potential down the road. If this resource works effectively, as some of the early studies suggest, we could be exporting gas to the UK.I do not see what the Deputy means about employment. Shell does a great deal of business and has invested heavily in this country. The Deputy said it receives preferential treatment but this is not the view of anyone in Shell's world or European management. Other countries have ways and means of treating large companies with which I do not agree. We have a very open and transparent system. I can imagine what would happen with a project such as this in most European countries. Perhaps those countries are wrong and we are right. I subscribe to that and I defend our position.There were no deals or arrangements other than those I mentioned, including the letter to which I referred in my initial reply. Normal consultation with officials took place.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 33, inclusive, together.The people of Northern Ireland will go to the polls on 26 November. Members will understand and appreciate that, as the campaign is under way, this is a time when the Governments should stand back.We all know that, following the election, a way will have to be found to restore the operation of all the political institutions and I hope we can do so. We made progress on 21 October despite the difficulties that arose. I have already made clear the significance we attach to the Sinn Féin and IRA statements issued that day. Both the British Government and this Government look forward to resuming political dialogue with the parties in the aftermath of the election. We want to achieve rapid agreement on the setting up of an inclusive Executive to pressing on with the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and fully securing its vision of a new beginning for all the people of this island.The Good Friday Agreement remains the template for political progress. It is the only viable basis for an agreed way forward and the only one that offers the prospect of attracting support from both communities. Its fundamental values, principles and protections are not up for negotiation. I commend the efforts made by all the pro-Agreement parties over the past five years to make politics work in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. While we know of all the difficulties and frustrations, we have also seen what can be achieved. The situation in Northern Ireland is unimaginably better as a result.I greatly appreciate the work of General John de Chastelain and his colleague, Mr. Andrew Sens. The integrity and commitment they have brought to the work of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning has been crucial to the progress made thus far. In my statement to the House on 22 October, I addressed in some detail the issues that arose at the meeting in Hillsborough the previous day.I met the PUP leader David Ervine in the context of a number of bilateral meetings and contacts I had with the Northern Ireland political parties, including the SDLP, the Women's Coalition and Alliance, in mid-October. I hope to meet the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at the next plenary meeting of the British-Irish Council which is due to be held in Wales on 28 November. Ambassador Haass participated in our meetings in Downing Street on 13 October and I thank him again for his constructive engagement in the process.As is customary, I expect to travel to the United States in March of next year for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. No date has yet been set for this. I also expect to meet President Bush in the context of our EU Presidency, including at the G8 summit which will take place in the United States on 8 and 9 June and at the EU-US summit, arrangements for which have yet to be confirmed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	135	In his capacity as Head of Government, does the Taoiseach think it is appropriate that posters of a Sinn Féin candidate in Northern Ireland should use the picture of Uachtarán na hÉireann in an electoral contest? This has never previously happened and all parties have respected this. Will the Taoiseach comment on this?The leaders of the Opposition parties have received letters from Margaret Urwin, campaign secretary for the Justice for the Forgotten group. She has informed us that on 16 December 1999 the group received a letter from the Taoiseach co-signed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This letter said that the report by Mr. Justice Barron would be produced as quickly as possible and brought before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Taoiseach will be aware that the Government received the report on 29 October. Will he indicate when it is expected the report will be published, come before the Dáil and be transferred to the appropriate committee?I have previously expressed concern about the Nally report into the Omagh bombing. Early in the summer, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that he would make a statement to the Dáil on the matter immediately on its resumption. The report runs to more than 100 pages and has been in the possession of the Government for some time. While I accept that it is quite a sensitive report, has the Government been able to resolve the legal difficulties that it  perceived as not allowing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law to make a statement to the House to this point? Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Minister will come before Dáil to speak on the Nally report?When can we expect to see the Cory report published?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Deputy Kenny is correct in that, in this jurisdiction, photographs with the President of the day have not been used in election literature. I know that throughout my career in politics such photographs have been excluded and I think this has been a convention since the foundation of the State. While I think I am aware of the case the Deputy has raised, I do not want to get into it. I have expressed views on this privately.While a question has been tabled regarding the Justice for the Forgotten group, we will not reach it in the course of Question Time. I have control of this report and I am anxious that we issue it quickly. Mr. Justice Barron gave me a letter regarding his concerns on some of the names and I would be glad to show it to the leaders of the Opposition in confidence. The obvious issue that arises is the safety of the individuals mentioned. I have no other problem with the report and am consulting on this issue only. While some of the names will have to be blacked out, I am anxious that not all are because I would wonder about the point of publishing a report if that were done. The Deputy will be aware of the system that operates in the House where the report is presented to the committee. I am examining whether I can give the names to the committee in some other way. While I do not see why I should hold back on this, I am engaged in consultation on the issue. I have no reason to withhold these names but there is that one difficulty. While Mr. Justice Barron has included the names, he has pointed out the difficulties that might arise from their wider publication.I cannot say that I am up to date on the Nally report. However, I know it is now with the Attorney General and, at least as per a fortnight ago, he is considering exactly how to deal with it. There are sensitive issues in the report about the security of the State and this is where the difficulties mainly lie. The problem in this report does not relate just to names, it is about the content of what was investigated. The information was given to the policing ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, and subsequently investigated by Mr. Nally and the two eminent former officials. The Minister gave a commitment that he would report to the House on the issue in October and he is anxious to do this. I would like these issues to be dealt with before Christmas.We received two parts of the Cory report – relating to the Buchanan case and that of Lord and Lady Gibson – and the British Government received six parts. I am not privy to anything contained in the reports submitted to the British Government. The discussions at official level with  Judge Cory have just concluded. The original intention was that the reports would be published together. We are almost ready to publish our parts of the report and I hope to raise this with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, next week.I am not sure where the British stand on their parts of the report. If the British are not ready to publish the reports, we will have to consider whether we will publish ours. I promised Geraldine Finucane that I would not only publish our report, but also use our influence to try to get the British to publish their reports. Our work on the Cory report is effectively finished and we will be ready to publish our parts subject to that arrangement with the British.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I wish to complain that the questions to the Taoiseach from Members, including myself, regarding meetings with President Bush have been grouped on the understanding that they referred to Northern Ireland. They were tabled for many different reasons, particularly in relation to President Bush's visit to the United Kingdom and also in relation to Iraq and Europe.

An assumption has been made by someone that we only wish to talk about President Bush in the context of Northern Ireland, worthwhile though that may be.It is important that the report of Mr. Justice Barron go to committee as quickly as possible. Can the Taoiseach do anything to speed it along? Does he share the view expressed, I think, by Senator Mansergh that there is a growing level of moderation in Northern Ireland politics? Will the Taoiseach give his perspective on whether that is a wish or a reality? Much work needs to be done in terms of getting the Assembly up and running after the election. What steps are being planned to bring about the culmination of that process?All too often in Northern Ireland politics we clutch at straws and try to read omens. Can the Taoiseach take some encouragement from the current edition of Wings, the magazine of BirdWatch Ireland, which has indicated that the corncrake has, for the first time in six years in Northern Ireland, been recorded at Drumcree, near Portadown. There is an omen in the fact that a bird which rarely accepts any habitat in Ireland is managing to find a home in Drumcree. I hope we will be able to say that Drumcree has brought about parity of esteem, not merely between Unionists and Nationalists but also in a wider biodiverse way.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I have said all I can, in reply to Deputy Kenny, about Justice for the Forgotten  and the Barron report, and I do not wish to add anything.It would not be helpful to speculate on anything relating to the Northern Ireland elections. It is essential that they take place in a positive atmosphere to enable the pro-Agreement parties to outline the real progress made under their stewardships and present their vision of a stable and inclusive partnership Government over the next four years. There is a democratic imperative for the holding of elections and the people have a right to pass a democratic verdict on the politicians who have represented them for the past five years and whose mandates have now expired. I hope the electorate will turn out in great numbers on 26 November. I do not wish to say any more on that matter.It is the intention of both Governments to work closely with the parties following the election to create the conditions which allow for the operation of a sustainable and fully functioning Executive as quickly as possible, together with the other institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement. I look forward to playing that role.Deputy Sargent asked about my perspective. It seems to everyone that the elections will take place in a normal atmosphere and that the debate is what one would expect during an election campaign.I am glad to hear the corncrake is in Drumcree. It is quieter there now.

What are the Taoiseach's views on the review and when is it likely to take place? Is it the intention that the parties in Northern Ireland, or the pro-Agreement parties in any event, will be involved or will it merely be a matter for the two Governments? Does the Taoiseach know how long the review is likely to take place? If there is a majority of pro-Agreement parties in the Assembly will priority be given to getting the institutions up and running again before a review of the Agreement is embarked upon?In respect of the collapse of the talks at Hillsborough, at which time the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister hinted – the Prime Minister hinted more explicitly than the Taoiseach – that they were in possession of information to do with decommissioning that was in addition to the information placed in the public domain by General de Chastelain, will the Taoiseach confirm that he was in possession of such information and does he wish to indicate the source of it? Does he wish to indicate the implications of the Prime Minister's statement that if we knew what he knew it would have transformed the possibility of the talks concerned?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Deputy Rabbitte has raised three points. First, after the election I hope circumstances will allow us to move on. It is the intention of both Governments to work closely with the parties following the election to create the conditions to allow the operation of a sustainable and fully functioning Executive as soon as possible. That is the preference of the two Governments.Second, the terms of reference of the review are set out in the Agreement and have been restated in paragraph 34 of the Joint Declaration. It is the intention of the two Governments to consult the parties prior to bringing forward proposals on the agenda and conducting a review. However, it is important to say – I do not over-emphasise the point – that the review of the operation of the Agreement is not a renegotiation. Some parties may attempt to gain political advantage by characterising it as a fresh negotiation, but it is not that and cannot be that. As far as the two Governments are concerned, the fundamental values, principles and protections of the Agreement are not open to negotiation.I would be glad to answer Deputy Rabbitte's last question in detail but I would rather not go into it now, as I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will understand. No matter what way I explain the matter, one side or the other will take it up. It is true that, as is on the record, we got information from General de Chastelain. It is not true to say he breached the agreement he had. It went no  further than that and any other interpretation would be unfair. He did give us a good account but did not breach his understanding of the agreement he has to operate. I do not want to spell out all the details at this stage but will do so at a later date.

Is he aware that in many areas within the Six Counties, there remains the intrusive presence of British military monstrosities and the patrols that work from them daily? They have an intrusive impact on the daily lives of ordinary citizens. Does he agree that this is proving very difficult, that it is challenging the changed political disposition that permeates throughout the island and that it runs contrary to everything we had hoped to see in terms of the working out of the Good Friday Agreement? What efforts has the Taoiseach employed in recent months to address the issue of ongoing British demilitarisation? What progress, if any, can he report or expect to report to this House?On the collapse of the agreement reached in October, the Taoiseach in his commentary to the House made a direct appeal to the IRA to reconsider its position on its confidentiality arrangements with the IICD regarding the decommissioning process. Since then, has he addressed such remarks to the Ulster Unionist Party to urge it to reconsider its position on the agreement reached and the need to ensure that the political process is back up and running with all-party support?

I accept his word that he is anxious to have them published and available to the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.The Taoiseach will be aware of the campaign of the families of those who were killed in the SAS ambush at Loughgall in 1987. When the Taoiseach meets the British Prime Minister next week or at a later date, will he raise the question of the allegations of a shoot-to-kill policy in that ambush? Does he share my view that the families of those involved deserve to know the truth?President Bush is visiting London today amid very tight security. Fourteen thousand policemen have been put on duty as a result. On some occasions in recent months the US Government has issued warnings about intended terrorist activities in various parts of the Middle East and Great Britain. In view of the fact that security forces in Northern Ireland are now on their second highest state of alert since the atrocities of 11 September 2001, have the Government, especially the Ministers for Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and our intelligence services had any contact from the US Government, for instance, in respect of the possibility of US or UK interests in Ireland being targeted by international terrorist groups? God forbid that this should happen.

Does he agree that it should have a crucial role in further developments of the peace process in Northern Ireland after the election?Does the Taoiseach feel he can justify, with others, the virtual exclusion of the SDLP from negotiations that were taking place at Hillsborough immediately prior to the declaration of the election? Does he believe the party was more or less left out of the loop in spite of its adherence to democratic principles? Will he undertake that, in any negotiations after the election, the SDLP will be given a pivotal role and that it will no longer be excluded? The impression is given that one does not count in Northern Ireland unless one has a military dimension. This does a very serious disservice to an entirely democratic party.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	164	In reply to Deputy Kenny, at Weston Park some years ago we agreed to consider a number of the cases that affect the communities across the divide and to conduct a comprehensive independent investigation into them. This is really what the conclusion of the Cory report is about. I, like Deputy Kenny, have been approached by many different groups from different communities that have, in one way or another, suffered horrendous atrocities over the years. All of these would like to have their cases investigated. We examined the concept of a truth and reconciliation commission at the start and this did not find favour right across the board. It is impossible to examine all the elements of each case. One will never be able to find a mechanism to address all the groups on an individual basis. While I have met many groups – I am sure I could name 20 or 25 off the top of my head, one of which is the Loughgall group – it is impossible to deal with them all. Every time we consider one group another comes forward. I understand the predicament of the Loughgall group.On President Bush's visit to the United Kingdom, it is correct to state that the security forces are on a state of high alert. There is no particular aspect of this on which we have received information but I assure Deputy Kenny and the House that we are constantly in touch with security authorities in the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe and across the world in respect of intelligence. No particular issue arises at the moment but we maintain a state of readiness, as we have done since the events of 11 September 2001.I assure Deputy McGinley that nobody has done more to include all the political parties in Northern Ireland, particularly in the recent discussions that took place in September and October. During these discussions there were many meetings with the SDLP and Sinn Féin and, as I stated, with the other parties, including the Women's Coalition, the Alliance Party, the UUP and the PUP. We have always tried to be inclusive. At times, certain issues affect one or more parties and in such cases we tend to focus on these parties. This does create problems. I hope the outcome of the election will allow us to return to a fully inclusive Executive and institutions, in which case none of these issues would arise.

Seven years after its designation as a regional cancer unit for the south-east serving a population of 420,000 people, Waterford Regional Hospital still does not have a designated oncology ward or designated palliative care beds and only has a day ward suitable for eight to ten patients when the hospital treats 40 to 50 patients daily. It also has inadequate pharmacy facilities for the constitution and storage of chemotherapy drugs which require that such drugs are transported from Dublin every day and grossly inadequate facilities for patients and their families which cause them terrible hardship at a time when they need every help.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need to determine the full range of infrastructure projects to be included by the Government in the proposed critical infrastructure (Dublin metro) Bill and whether these will include mass incineration plants and enormous projects such as the proposed 2,500 acre virtual city referred to in newspapers today.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be contemplated by Standing Order 31 and therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motions.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	169	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 19, motion re Book of Estimates, 2004 (Resumed); No. 5, Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Private Members' business, which shall be No. 39, motion re criminal justice system, shall be taken at 7 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 19, whichever is the later, and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	170	There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business agreed to? Agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	171	What are the contents of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2003? Is the Bill relevant to the sections of the regulations the Minister for Health and Children failed to send to Brussels for approval?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Bill concerns the regulations under the 2002 Act, not current issues.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Government made a bags of the original Act and has to bring it before the House again.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I know the Minister for Justice,  Equality and Law Reform is preoccupied with other matters, but he and the Taoiseach made a commitment at the time of the retirement of Mr. Justice Flood that legislation would be brought before the House to cope with the new circumstances. When will that Bill come before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The legislation is published and is, as far as I know, awaiting Second Stage. It is the tribunal of inquiry (evidence) (amendment) Bill. The heads are expected and although the Bill is still listed for this session, I do not think it will be taken in this session. The heads of the Bill are meant to be ready in early December so I presume the Bill will be ready after Christmas. It should be published by Christmas.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	176	During the summer the Government intimated that legislation would be introduced to deal with lobbying. Have there been any moves to bring forward this legislation? Will it appear or is it on a list we have not seen to date? I wish to ask again about legislation expected since 1980, namely, the charities Bill. Following the publication of the Estimates, this legislation will be sought with greater urgency by groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which need to make up for Government cutbacks. Has any progress be made on the Bill other than it will appear some time next year?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The heads of the Bill are expected early in the new year. It is hoped that the ongoing consultation process will lead to a single, tighter framework in which to bring forward the legislation which is really a product of the Costello report.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The report was published in 1980.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Yes, it was published a long time ago. The legislation should be ready next year. It is a long time since I have been asked about the other matter. I understand other countries are being looked at which had similar systems to ours. There were a few such countries which have since repealed their legislation. We are looking to see if there is a way of legislating for this issue, other than a register. Other countries have introduced a register on which lobbyists must formally register. It is a public record, but there is no legislative provision around it.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	180	When will No. 23a on the Order Paper, a financial resolution regarding excise duties some 12 or 13 pages in length, be taken? Has the Government ceased all work on the introduction of electronic voting in view of the fact that the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government has summoned the Minister and his officials to appear before it to answer questions on the security of the systems being implemented and especially in view of the fact that €38 million—

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	182	—of taxpayers' money has been spent on it without any consultation with those who will be involved in the process?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	183	We cannot have a debate on the matter. The Deputy has asked his question.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Government has taken a unilateral, arrogant approach to the democratic process.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The system cost €38 million.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The regulations on the first matter raised by Deputy Allen will be taken next week. There is no legislation on the second matter on which action is already in train.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Government pushed it through.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	190	In the previous Dáil, the House debated Second Stage of a Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Rabbitte, the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. The legislation has been placed on the legislative programme for this Dáil. Does the Government intend to proceed with the enactment of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill or will it produce its own whistleblowers Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I understand work on this matter is still ongoing in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Bill is awaiting Committee Stage and has been for several years. I can try to get an update for the Deputy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I would appreciate that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	194	It will be this session.

As the Taoiseach will be aware, we import in the region of 100,000 tonnes of potatoes each year from Britain which is experiencing a threat to its potato crop. Will the Taoiseach arrange for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to test all potato imports until the threat of disease has been removed?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The question is out of order. The Deputy will need to do better with the second one.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	197	There is a blight on him today.

Given that he can walk on water, my second question regarding the land Bill will be close to the Taoiseach's heart. When can we expect the Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Bill will be introduced next year.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I wish to pick up on the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Allen on No. 23a, a resolution to give effect to the increases in motor taxation announced last week by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. When this resolution came before the House last year, an hour was allocated to debate it. In view of the fact that the Minister has stated that the proceeds of the increases in motor taxation would be used to fund increased allocations for non-national roads and to local authorities to meet the cost of benchmarking, and since it is manifestly not permitted to do both under the Estimates, will the Taoiseach allow more than an hour to debate this resolution? The issues raised relate not only to increases in motor taxation, but also the state of non-national roads and local government finances as we face into the Estimates in the few weeks.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I will communicate that to the Government Chief Whip.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	203	A number of months ago the Minister for Transport said that lives could be lost without the Railway Safety Bill. This was priority legislation but it seems to have disappeared.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The Railway Safety Bill is awaiting completion of Report Stage.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	205	We welcome the recent initiatives by the Minister for Transport in the fight against drink driving whereby the gardaí will have power to stop, arrest and detain people—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	206	A question, please.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	207	—when it is believed that they committed an offence previously. Will the Taoiseach intercede with the Minister and ask him to devolve power and resources to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enable him to stop and investigate organised criminal gangs in this city and throughout the country who are harassing witnesses at railway stations and who have taken the law into their own hands?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The Deputy should submit a question to the appropriate Minister. I call Deputy McManus.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	209	At what stage will the Taoiseach indicate to his Ministers the importance of those two issues—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Allow Deputy McManus to ask her question.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	211	—and whether action is likely to be taken under the criminal justice Bill or the crimes Bill?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Members cannot discuss the content of a Bill.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	214	With regard to the crimes Bill, an expert group to advise on the possible approaches to the codification of the law is expected to report back in early 2004. The heads of the criminal justice Bill have been approved and the Bill has been sent for drafting.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I have two questions. Following the decision by the Medical Council on the Neary case, the Government promised speedy action on the medical practitioners Bill. I am concerned that this matter is slipping in priority. The victims who suffered mutilation at the hands of Dr. Neary have now been denied a meeting with the Minister for Health and Children.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	216	It was postponed.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	217	When will the medical practitioners Bill be introduced? It has been long delayed and there is great concern about it. The second question relates to the debate promised on the cancer radiotherapy services report. This has slipped off the map altogether. It was due to be debated with the Hanly report. Obviously, the focus has been on the Hanly report in view of the difficulty in trying to get agreement in Government on the report. When will we have the promised debate on the report on cancer radiotherapy services?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The heads of the medical practitioners Bill are expected to be completed before Christmas and the Bill will be presented next year. The other matter relates to a report and it should be taken up with the Whips.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	219	It was agreed that the House would have a debate on both the Hanly report and the report on cancer services. The Taoiseach has to do better in his response.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The Deputy should take up the matter with the Whips.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Is the Deputy telling me that I made a commitment or is she asking me to make a commitment?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Then there is a commitment that we will debate the issue. I have already made the commitment.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I have made the commitment.

It is not, it is a matter for the Chief Whip. At Whips meetings we are told of the business of the House and there is no debate.

The Government needs to make an important decision on setting cap levels for allocations to the traded sector, which comprises approximately 100 large companies in Ireland, with regard to the amount of carbon they are allowed to emit before they are fined. Will legislation be required to introduce these allocations or caps? Will the House have an opportunity to debate the issue or will it be confined to the private consultation process that is currently ongoing?

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	267	"Ireland – the Poorest of Europe's Rich", as The Economist magazine said in an infamous article in 1987. Ireland really was in the doldrums. Taxes were high, inflation rampant and industrial unrest widespread, while young people were leaving in search of a job in numbers not seen since the 1950s. Although we had become a basket case economy and there was increasing talk about the IMF intervening directly, 1987 was a watershed in the turnaround of the nation's fortunes. This was the year Fianna Fáil returned to Government, after five years of utter mismanagement by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition. Faced with cleaning up the mess, Fianna Fáil began to lay out a strategy of recovery which was to begin to bear fruit in the 1990s, the benefits of which we still experience.In that year, under the guidance of the current Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Labour, the first social partnership agreement was hammered out. This agreement became the template on which stability and prosperity was built and continues to be a crucial aspect of economic and social policy going forward.In 2003, having been returned to office for a second term, the Government has set out its spending priorities for the next year. The Esti mates being debated, which are built on six years of steady leadership and in the context of the worst global economic downturn in 20 years, will ensure that we are strongly positioned to benefit from future economic recovery, maintain and create employment and increase wealth.The people clearly want the assurance of a capable Government with a proven track record which will put their taxes to good use.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	268	With no dissenters.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Government has set a steady course for the long term. It is setting priorities and making choices. This requires making tough decisions and having a vision which focuses on reality. It is not about quick fixes and short-term sound bites. The heady days of double digit growth are over and we must now operate within a new reality.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Speaking with one voice.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	271	We cannot continue with the level of public spending possible in the recent past as the Government has less revenue at its disposal. We could return to a borrowing reliance, which many in the Opposition would have us do, but we know where that got us in the 1980s.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Government borrowed €1.9 billion last year.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The gains made in recent years must be protected, and the only way forward is a greater prioritisation of spending. The fact that the Government is still able to increase spending, albeit at a slower rate than previously, is a clear indication that we are getting it right. Next year the Government will spend more than €40 billion, the highest ever. This is an increase of 5%, roughly double what is being achieved by other euro zone members. The extra €1.9 billion builds on a base of a massive increase in public spending in recent years and is being targeted where it is most needed, in building our infrastructure and developing our public services. We are operating within tighter financial constraints, but crucially we are still moving forward.Although we have entered the stormy waters of an international downturn not of our making, there is brighter weather on the horizon. Recently, positive signs that the US economy is emerging from the doldrums have become apparent. Although these early signs of international recovery are encouraging, we must remain focused and responsible in our resolve. To deviate from our strategy of prioritising spending would be folly in the extreme.The Government has demonstrated consistently that it is up to the job, and it is in this context that the Estimates should be viewed. Despite the efforts of the Opposition and some commentators to talk down the economy, we are in a very strong position. The fundamentals remain sound.  Unemployment remains low, inflation is falling and interest rates are low. Our economic performance has been, and continues to be, the envy of our European neighbours. I have no doubt that most of them would love to swap their problems for ours.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	274	What evidence has the Minister for that?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Although the so-called Celtic tiger period has been consigned to history by most commentators, its effects are clearly apparent. There is no doubt that over the past five to seven years there has been an irreversible transformation in the economy and, more importantly, in society. Ireland ten years ago and Ireland today are different countries. Despite a definite slowing up, this new transformed Ireland has put down deep roots. It is the duty of the Government to ensure these roots are nurtured and sustained in more challenging times.There was no way – and it was even undesirable – for double digit growth to continue. The phenomenal growth of the economy in recent years has settled down, and because we have worked so hard to get the fundamentals right, we are in a strong and secure position. To have the resolve of being able to govern through more difficult times is the real test of good Government. These Estimates demonstrate clearly the strength of this resolve.It is worth restating for the record – I am sure it will be repeated by many of my colleagues – how far we have come in the past six years. More than 400,000 new jobs have been created, with the ending of the massive emigration that blighted our country in the 1980s. Historically low levels of unemployment have been achieved, with long-term jobless figures being reduced by 80%. We have reduced our debt levels from 95% to 33% of gross national product – the second lowest in the EU, increased exports by 115% and brought living standards above and beyond those of our neighbours.We have given people greater freedom to make their own choices by reducing the tax burden by almost €5 billion and have weighted this heavily in favour of the less well-off. Along with the most extensive measures at promoting social inclusion ever undertaken through record investment in health, education and social welfare, we have succeeded in removing almost 420,000 people from the tax net since our first budget in 1997.These are real and lasting achievements which give us a strong platform from which the economy is well positioned to take full benefit of an improvement in the world economy. The Estimates will allow the Government not just to sustain the gains we have made but to build on them. Our focus remains on the greatest areas of priority. Health, education, social welfare and capital investment in infrastructure receive the largest increases. The bulk of the extra €1.9  billion will be spent in these areas because they are of greatest priority within the resources the Government has available to it. Social welfare will now receive €10.6 billion, health €10 billion, education €6.5 billion and infrastructure €5.5 billion. In simple terms, this is more money for pensions, hospitals, the employment of medical personnel, teachers, school building, third level research, roads, railways, transport and housing. All this comes on the back of sustained increases in recent years.Although the Government has taken a more prudent approach to public spending, investment in the key areas continues. There is no doubt the direction is clearly forward. We must nurture and develop an environment which maintains quality employment, keeps inflation down and sustains competitiveness. The Book of Estimates will continue this momentum and I commend it to the House.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring. We must be in a unique position today in Dáil Éireann in that the Minister for Defence addressed the House on the Estimates without mentioning his own Department in the course of his speech. It must be unique that a Minister has not done so and certainly I have never heard of it before. Why did the Minister for Defence make no reference to his Department or the spending that will take place in it? Is he embarrassed by the fact that he will do so badly and will not be able to deliver the service? This must be unique.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I have always done it.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	278	When we heard some of the information contained in his speech, we wondered from where it had emanated. Is it part of his payback for last week and a bit of grovelling? He said that we could return to the borrowing reliance. Is the Minister not aware that the Government borrowed this year to pay the SSIA account holders? This is not real. He went on to refer to our European neighbours and said: "I have no doubt most of them would love to swap their problems for ours." Is the Minister living in the real world? Is he living in his own little cocoon down in Tipperary from which he emerges now and again to let us know from where he comes? Is he real when he speaks about our European neighbours wanting to swap their problems for ours? He must be joking. Let us look at our health services and the way they are being treated. Look at what is happening to law and order. He is running out the door.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I am here.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Let us look at the promises he and his colleagues made in the run up to the last election, on none of which Government delivered. Is it any wonder he should run out the door and run away from it? He went on to say: "To have the resolve of being able to govern through more difficult times is the real test of good Government."
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	281	It is.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	282	For the Minister for Defence to put that into a speech this week, after the week he has had, takes neck. That must gain the greatest brass neck award of this century for the Minister. I repeat the statement in case it has not been heard properly: "To have the resolve of being able to govern through more difficult times is the real test of good Government."  In other words, we live by what we have done, we will not dissent, we will not break away from collective responsibility or anything else. In saying that, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, wins the brass neck award.The Estimates, as published by the Government last week, will bring about further difficulties for those at the margins, those on low incomes and ordinary middle class citizens who have to pay for everything, their mortgage, the additional supplements for their children to go to school, and respond to the fund raising collections for new schools and so on. What help is there for them in the Estimates? Absolutely nothing. Further stealth taxes will be imposed.To qualify for the drugs refund scheme the threshold has been increased to €78. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Cowley, who has experience in this area, will be aware that for a person with a bout of illness a visit to their local GP will cost €35 and if he or she has to go for a prescription—
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	283	It costs €45 in Dublin, not in Punchestown.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	284	We have GPs who operate on a more reasonable basis in our part of the country and I commend them for it. Their visit to the GP costs €35 and the drugs will possibly cost in the region of €78. To take that amount of money out of anyone's salary in a week would make a considerable hole in it. If they have to make a return visit to their GP and get more medicine it will be very expensive for them. Who will this affect most? If we have to pay for that we can manage it. It does not affect us too badly. For those on the margins or on reasonable incomes, this will be a huge hole in their resources and they will have great difficulties. What was to happen for those people?In the run up to the last election the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs – unfortunately Deputy Coughlan was not then Minister – and his colleagues promised 200,000 more medical cards. What has happened to that promise? Absolutely nothing. In this Book of Estimates there is no hope for those people.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am sorry the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, has left the House because the  Hanly report has gone to his head. He will have to be sent to a psychiatric hospital since he is not living in the real world. Certainly, he learnt about the real world when he went down to Tipperary recently to speak about the Hanly report. This is probably the most right wing Thatcherite Government that has ever been in power since the foundation of the State.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Deputy is quoting.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	289	This Government will be remembered as the most savage since the foundation of the State for its attack on the poor. I am disappointed the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, allowed her colleagues at the Cabinet table to walk all over her and take €57 million out of her budget, thus attacking the most vulnerable in society in respect of the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme which is gone, and the rent allowance, the most outrageous of all, on which I have tabled a question for next week. How will the Minister implement the new system of rent allowance? It will not work.All voluntary organisations in the State are crying out about what is happening to the poor. I will be expecting wonderful things from the Minister in the budget. If what happened last week is the signal and the message that has gone out, it is a disgrace.I listened this morning to somebody from the racing industry say how much money is being taken from off course betting. This Government thinks more of animals than it does of people. That is sad but it is the truth.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	290	That is not true.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	291	That is the truth. It sickens me to see the way Mr. Magnier and Alex Ferguson can fight out stud fees in court while there are people who cannot live on social welfare owing to the increased cost of food and other cost rises. The Government wants to take them out and does not want them around. It is outrageous.The Minister should have stood up last week and should have done as the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, did last week. She should have said that if the Government goes ahead with this reduction she will resign and that somebody else should be found to do the job.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I listened to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, speak about direct taxes and indirect taxes. The Government will destroy this economy because there is a stealth tax every  day. What local authorities propose to do in the coming months will affect the poor. I hope that in the budget the Minister will protect the social welfare increases and that they will not be taken in stealth tax by the local authorities in respect of charges, rent and so on. There is a great deal of outrage. It will not be long before the people take to the streets because they will not put up with much more of this. They are angry, annoyed and frustrated in regard to what is happening.There is a two-tier system here, one law for the rich and one law for the poor. The poor are suffering and have been targeted by the Government in recent years. The first time there is a downturn it attacks the poor.It sickens and galls me to hear individuals such as the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, tell us this morning how wonderful the economy is. Of course it is wonderful. It is wonderful for the rich because they get away with low taxes and there is every kind of tax break for them. However, it is not wonderful for the poor person on social welfare, medical cards, rent allowance and on housing lists and it is certainly not wonderful for those waiting for hip, heart and cataract operations.When we see the budget I hope there will be major increases for those on social welfare and those who need them most. However, I doubt it, given that the Government has taken €57 million out of the Minister's budget and is targeting the most vulnerable in society. I do not see much hope for the poor. As Deputy Paul McGrath has said, in its manifesto the Government promised to increase the number of medical cards. Those people have been let down by the Government but they will not forget. In June the people will be able to adjudicate on this Thatcherite right wing Government. The Minister has the Thatcherites behind her supporting her.

Instead they shed crocodile tears, failing to admit that there is a record spend on social welfare provision, a spend increased year on year by Fianna Fáil in Government. Let the facts speak for themselves, and here are just a few.

In their time, the Labour Party and Fine Gael's average rise in the lowest social welfare rate was just €2.74 compared to €6.96 under this Government. We have removed 77,000 pensioners from the tax net and increased pensions by 59% since 1997. In comparison, when Democratic Left controlled the social welfare purse strings, before controlling the Labour Party completely, its then Minister saluted the country's elderly with a derisory increase in the pension of £1.80.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Compared to 1997, when this Government came into office, total social welfare expenditure will have almost doubled. During the same period, unemployment has dramatically declined from a rate of 10.3% to 4.4%. This has enabled substantial improvements to be made, not alone in the rates of social welfare payments, but also in the conditions for entitlement to these services. For example, old age pensions have been increased by over €58 a week. The rate of child benefit for the first two children has increased by almost €87.50 a month.

These spending pressures emphasise the need for my Department to ensure careful management of the social welfare budget—

Expenditure on various social welfare payments is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that these schemes continue to meet their objectives. During the year, areas of potential savings have been identified and several measures are now being implemented to ensure that social welfare spend is better focused. For the most part, these measures will not affect existing claimants, but  will apply to new claimants from various dates in 2004.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The original qualifying period was set at a time when unemployment was considerably higher. Since then unemployment has fallen dramatically. Furthermore, the Government has introduced the employment action plan which offers job placement or other supports such as training for those who find it difficult to be placed in employment. Until now, with an intervention point for both second and third level courses at six months, the measure was not particularly well targeted at labour market disadvantage. Existing recipients of BTEA will not be affected. This measure still allows people to avail of the second level option after six months in receipt of a payment. This effectively recognises the more urgent need for an intervention in the case of people who have not completed secondary education.

In this context, several measures regarding social welfare allowance rent  supplement scheme will be implemented. These include an increase in the minimum contribution to be made by the recipients from €12 to €13 per week in order to maintain the rate of the minimum contribution at approximately 10% of the basic personal rate of supplementary welfare allowance. In future, if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both will be excluded from claiming rent or mortgage supplement.

Health boards will be given the power to refuse rent supplement in cases where the applicant has not already been renting for a period of six months, with provisions for exceptions to the homeless, people who are at risk of becoming homeless and other vulnerable people. The purpose of the SWA rent supplement, like other social welfare programmes, is to meet income maintenance needs, not long-term housing needs.

When some of the Opposition Deputies were on the county councils they did not do much for them. With regard to all the SWA measures, particular care will be taken to ensure that the interests of vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, the elderly and people with disabilities, are fully protected in the course of implementing these measures.

Where their earnings are between €146.50 and €293 per week a benefit is reduced by 50 cent for each euro of earnings. Further arrangements are in place which enable lone parents to retain 50% of their previous entitlement for a transitional period of 12 months where their earnings go over the €293 threshold. This transitional payment was originally intended to ease the move from social welfare to employment by cushioning the loss of the social welfare payment.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	394	The OECD study stated that the existing system of earnings disregard serves largely to encourage lone parents to top up benefit income with small earnings rather than help them back into regular employment. The study suggested that the family income supplement could be better promoted as a tool for providing financial incentives for lone parents to enter employment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	395	That has gone down by 4% in the Minister's Estimate. If what the Minister is saying is true, why did—

Gone long since are the days when the Government was full of promise before the last general election, when it set very high standards. A lot done, more to do, was the slogan, and the Government was certainly right in that regard.

The Government set about making the homeless more uncomfortable than they were.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Since the Government came to office the number of homeless people has increased. I did not think that was possible, and I do not know if the Government thought it was possible, but it has proved so. The Government has made things more difficult for the homeless and, by means of the cuts it has introduced in the past few days, has ensured that an increasing number will become homeless.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	417	That is not true.

It is a sadistic pleasure which manifests itself in the Government making life more difficult for the most defenceless people in our community.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	422	The Deputy should recall his former leader.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Government, by virtue of the recent budget and the recent proposals, is anti-family. As a constituency politician working on the ground, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that young people today can no longer marry or enter into a permanent relationship because they cannot afford to buy a house. If they enter into a permanent relationship, any social welfare benefits they had are removed from them. They have two options. They can either go into the black economy and defraud the system or remain forever on the streets because the Government does  not intend to do anything for them. The Government has done some strange things.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The strangest thing of all is that the people who were in difficulty before, the people who expected the Government to deliver to them, as per its proposals in the last general election, are helpless and forlorn. The Government is taking pleasure in that, but it will not go on forever.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	426	What did the Deputy's party do?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	427	There are two Ministers in the House today who cannot make up their minds who is responsible for housing. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs says her Department has no responsibility and that the cuts that have taken place in rental allowances do not affect the housing situation. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government says rental allowance is an integral part of housing, and that situation is now made more difficult.
#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The Deputy is part of the £1.83 brigade.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to ask the Deputies on that side of the House, who are living in fairyland, to tell us where the people will get the money to pay for rented accommodation for six months. Where will they get it in the future? The Government was right when it said there was a lot done and more to do, because it intends to do more people. If the public thinks the Government has finished with them, it has not. The Government is saving up for the next general election, for the next onslaught on the social fabric of this country. The Government intends to spend the money before the general election, pay back all the money it failed to pay before and con the people again. The people who formerly had difficulty getting housing will, with the homeless, increase in number on the streets of Dublin and the towns for the foreseeable future.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	430	That has nothing to do with Fine Gael.

I will take  up this case again. As a result of the activities of the Government we will have more poor and homeless, more crime and more ill health. The Government is attempting to make living a luxury.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Some 200,000 medical cards were promised for the poor of this country, but what has happened? Thousands have been taken away. That is a fact which cannot be denied. The poor are being made poorer, there is no question about that. I have no intention of referring to the cuts of €56 million which the Government has imposed. That will be dealt with by some of my colleagues. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs need have no worry but that the country will give its reaction to that.Rent increases have been implemented even before this year's Book of Estimates or the budget. I met a person recently who has been given one of these special jobs through redeployment, and his rent has already increased from €18 to €47. That is some way to treat a man trying to get off the ground.We heard last night in this House and again today of 64 elderly people waiting for subvention beds because there is no money in the North Eastern Health Board. Local authorities have to raise €160 million as a result of the Government's cutbacks in the local government grant. That forms part of the extra stealth taxes which are not included in the Book of Estimates and will not be included in the budget.The Minister for Transport is present in the House. I welcome his efforts to deal with problems in many areas, but in regard to the N2 and N3 and cross-Border roads that are supposed to be maintained under the Good Friday agreement, there has been no roll-out in Castleblayney, Monaghan town, Cavan town or Belturbet, or on a road right through to Donegal.

The Tánaiste has cut the budget for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the enterprise boards. There is no support from the Government for those who want to make a start. The poor are being made poorer. The Government is not helping young people looking for jobs and housing because it is cutting off much-needed help and is imposing levies through the county councils because it is not prepared to impose them itself.

The historically high level of investment in major infrastructure is being maintained by the Department next year when a total of €1.227 billion – in excess of €100 million each month – will be invested in construction of motorways and dual carriageways. The 2004 provision, which is more than half of the entire Estimate for the Department next year, will be invested in up to 27 major road projects. I am confident that an agreed guaranteed financial package for the major road construction programme will soon be finalised. This will commit investment of approximately €6 billion over the next five years subject to finalisation of the financial package for that period with the Department of Finance.The roads allocation builds on the progress being made this year when 11 major roads projects consisting of 82 kilometres of high quality roads are completed and opened to traffic. These include the M1 motorway and the Kildare, Glen of the Downs, Watergrasshill and Youghal bypasses. The 2004 provision of €1.227 billion will fund 16 projects which are under way or due to get under way before the end of the year, including the N2 Carrickmacross, Monasterevin, N11 Rathnew-Ashford and Cashel bypasses, the M50 south-eastern motorway and the M50 Dublin Port tunnel. It will also fund the commencement of work next year on another 11 projects, including the N2 Ashbourne and N6 Loughrea bypasses, the N4 Sligo inner relief road, the N18  Ennis bypass, the N25 Kinsale Road interchange and the N25 Waterford bypass.

A provision of €53 million is also being made for maintenance of the national roads network which will ensure a good programme of work in maintaining surface quality.There will be significant improvements in public transport services in 2004 due to the major investment of more than €1 billion undertaken since 1999. This was used to upgrade the track system and make it safer. More than 80% of the national track system has been completely renewed and is brand new. The next stage will be investment in the more visible side of the railways such as carriages and engines. Up to now most of the taxpayers' money was used for the upgrading of the rail network to make it safer. The total allocation for public transport in £2004 is €646 million. Of this €366 million is capital funding and another €37 million is EU funding, bringing the total capital investment in public transport to more than €400 million.The provision of a €260 million subvention to the CIE companies is an increase of 6% and will allow the operating companies, Iarnród Éireann, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, to continue to upgrade the quality and frequency of services to attract higher numbers to public transport. Iarnród Éireann's new timetable is largely driven by the delivery of the additional 80 diesel rail cars and will see a significant increase in capacity and frequency of services on the peak commuter services. The introduction of the new timetable in  early December 2003 will also see improvements in the off-peak period as well as in intercity services and commuter services outside Dublin. Gaps in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon intercity and outer suburban rail timetables will be filled by this new timetable. There is good news for the Limerick-Clare region with the introduction of seven additional services on the Limerick-Ennis service, and in Cork the commuter service from Cobh to Cork will now extend to Mallow.The delivery of 40 DART cars will commence in 2004. When they go into service, DART passenger capacity will have increased by 100% since 2000.

Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath continue to upgrade and enhance their fleets and, with the dedicated bus corridors in place, the bus is proving to be an attractive and successful mode of transport. To further support the bus as a preferred mode of transport, €40 million has been allocated to traffic management grants in the Dublin area which will double the number of dedicated bus corridors to 18. The provision of bus corridors in Galway and Cork is being considered and other cities are invited to seek funds for the introduction of quality bus corridors. It is critically important that bus corridors continue to be introduced so that buses can travel around the cities more easily and attract more passengers. A sum of €40 million has been allocated for traffic management grants in the Dublin area and €35 million of that amount will be spent next year on quality bus corridors, which is a significant investment in the bus lane programme in 2004. I would like to increase the number of quality bus corridors from nine to 18 by the end of 2004 and the DTO is working on that.The Estimates provide €187 million for the safety and development of public transport. The reconvened task force on rail safety is completing its report and its recommendations will form the basis of the 2004 railway safety programme. Over €670 million has already been invested in the safety programme, resulting in over 90% of track being renewed, a higher percentage than indicated earlier. Approximately €37 million in EU funds will be provided for CIE public transport projects such as Heuston Station and the DART upgrade.Overall, the Estimates for 2004 demonstrate that substantial investment in public transport, substantially higher than was the case two years ago, is beginning to provide users with a safe travelling environment and move more people throughout the city.

Luas will provide additional capacity of 8,500 during peak times, with journey times of 42 minutes from Tallaght to Connolly Station and 22 minutes from Sandyford to the city centre.Funding has also been made available for accessibility projects, the rural public transport initiative, interchange developments and research into public transport.

The Government is going to brazen this out, pretending that it has not made the meanest cuts we have seen in social welfare, affecting the most defenceless in society, since the dirty dozen. The Minister comes in and throws around global figures, with so many billions spent on social welfare and so many hundreds of millions spent on one aspect or another. There was not a word, however, about the real people who will be affected by what she has done.The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, can lay fair claim to being the most popular Deputy in the House, and I agree with that. There is a price to pay for being a Cabinet Minister, however, and she has allowed herself to be mugged by the Minister for Finance in these Estimates. She does not seem to appreciate what she has been forced to do. Coming into this House and saying that the total spend on social welfare now is €X billion, compared to €Y billion seven years ago, is neither here nor there. That is not the issue. The issue is that the most vulnerable, those without a voice, who in many cases do not vote, will pay the price for the cuts she has introduced. She does not seem to understand that the entire trend in recent years – Fianna Fáil was involved at the time when my colleague Deputy Burton started the process – has been towards the progressive reform of social welfare to encourage lone parents back into employment.

No one disputes that but it is a complete red herring because there are still unem ployed people and lone parents, and their numbers are rising. There are still those who need the dietary supplement, those with coeliac disease and those in the home where the spouse or partner is working who will be driven back into poverty as a result of these changes.What is the point in telling me that there are more people at work? When we left Government, more than 1,000 jobs a week were being created. In recent times we have been losing 500 jobs a week in the traditional sector, although, happily, there has been growth in other sectors. There is no point in bring me down a cul-de-sac. We know about job expansion, just as we know that the population is much larger.At the beginning of this discussion, a colleague gave me a note about discussions with her local money advice bureau service to help a woman to put an arrangement in place with the credit union to repay the mortgage. Her husband is a chronic alcoholic, a phenomenon known to Deputies on both sides of the House, there are children to be reared and the building society is threatening to take the house.

The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and all the other organisations concerned are already on record in that regard and the Minister will hear more about it before the Social Welfare Bill is introduced.

I also remind the Labour Party that it has fallen into the old trap of forgetting the fundamentals in any society, that we must first create wealth before we can distribute it. The Labour Party is falling back into its old tricks – high borrowing, high  taxation and all that follows that. Collectively, it is a party of promises.

The Govern ment of 1983-87 was irresponsible, and that is something you will live to regret.

However, it has decided to put its head in the sand again. Perhaps we could negotiate the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of public private partnerships and EUROSTAT. Ireland's growth, which started from a low base, is handicapped as a result of that.

It would be advantageous to the Cork region and to UCC. I know commitments have been made by private individuals and that one donor has committed up to €7 million. UCC would also be able to provide €30 million of its own resources to fund this project. The information, technology and communications building would be a great asset to UCC. I urge the Minister to proceed with that project.As regards public private partnerships, the Cork School of Music is an issue which must be addressed and I urge the Minister to progress that issue.

I would like Deputy Burton to put on the record whether the Labour Party opposes the Cork School of Music project. That is news to me because Deputy Lynch says she supports it. It seems you now oppose the project.

There are also compulsory purchase orders in place for land from Kinnegad to Athlone. Loughrea, which is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the country, is also included. We must welcome this morning's announcement of money. I did not think we would see modern technology, such as broadband, in Mullingar and Athlone. That will be connected in some areas before Christmas. I did not think – I am sure Deputy Penrose agrees – that the gas line would also be connected to these major towns.

#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Since the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition was elected in 1997 relative income poverty in Ireland has steadily increased. People living on under half the average income are defined as living in poverty. Last year almost 6,000 people died as a direct result of poverty, according to Dr. Jane Wilde of the Institute of Public Health. In 1997 18.1% of the population was below the poverty line and that had risen to 20.9% by 2000. Government policy has increased inequality in our society. These numbers are higher among some of the more vulnerable groups. Poverty in the over 65 age group is at 35.9%, while it is 24.9% for children. That means 300,000 children go to school cold and hungry.Poverty is a life-long prison sentence for a significant proportion of society. It is alarming that the increase in poverty is happening against a backdrop of an economic boom and historically low unemployment. The inescapable analysis is that there is a growing number of working people who are poor in this country. They will be the hardest hit by these Estimates. International research and policy intervention shows that low rates of child poverty are associated with high levels of social expenditure. Unsurprisingly, therefore, this State has the lowest spend on social services in Europe. Sinn Féin believes that tackling poverty, particularly child poverty, should be the top priority in this year's budget. That will necessitate a redistributed budget which uses the wealth created in our society as a means of tack ling poverty and social exclusion. That means taxing the super rich and the elite in our society.The Book of Estimates published last week dramatically exposed the inequity in our society, which is sustained by the policy not only of this Government but of successive Governments. Much criticism has been rightly levelled at the Government by the Opposition over its generous disposition to the bloodstock industry. I do not have a problem with promoting our bloodstock industry and providing assistance to those who genuinely need it, but it is a cash rich industry. How can the Government justify its extravagant expenditure on this industry, while cutting crucial provisions in social welfare, such as the rent supplement? We heard this week that one leading figure in the industry is preparing to splash out more than €500,000 on a car. We also had the spectacle of Sir Alex Ferguson coming to town to engage in a legal battle over multi-million pound stud fees in which he is the main protagonist.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	633	Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has been up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the programme cervical screening is being offered to approximately 74,000 women, aged 25 to 60, free of charge at five-year intervals. A commitment was given in the national health strategy to extend the programme to the rest of the country. A key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.The process of implementing and organising the national programme is a major undertaking that requires careful consideration involving significant logistical and resource implications. The health boards executive, HeBE, is examining the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme. A key element of this work is a review of phase one. Other aspects of the examination include policy development, establishment of national governance arrangements, learning derived from other national programmes and current international best practice.The evaluation of phase one, which comprises an integrated evaluation and planning approach, is currently under way. The retrospective analysis is being linked closely to established best practice and emerging international thinking on cervical screening, and it is intended that this will inform the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. The evaluation dimensions of the review include the overall approach to be taken by the national programme in the context of best practice elsewhere, quality assurance arrangements, standard operating procedures, governance arrangements, business model and organisational arrangements, programme screening policies, a population register, risk analysis and payment arrangements. It is expected that this evaluation of phase one will be completed early in 2004. A separate study relating to the functioning of the programme in terms of its women's charter is under way and will also be completed in 2004.In regard to policy development for the national programme, I am advised that the sub-group established by HeBE and led by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, is currently preparing a series of policy proposals to be adopted by the programme. These policy proposals will address a wide range of issues including the priority target groups to be reached by the programme, the most appropriate screening intervals, laboratory accreditation, the use of liquid-based cytology, information systems, HPV immunisation and the development of population registers. In summary, the evaluation of phase one is a major part of the planning process for the national programme and once it is completed, HeBE has advised that it will be in a position to prepare a draft roll-out plan. Governance structures for the full national programme are also being considered. A final  decision on structures will be taken in the context of the evaluation report and roll-out plan.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Will the Minister agree that the pilot project, such as it is, has been an unmitigated disaster? It has been running for almost six years. To talk about best practice and quality assurance in the context of what is called a pilot programme is a joke. The take-up rate is almost negligible. There is no follow-up system, no database and no recall system. There has been no roll-out. It is impossible to evaluate because there is nothing to evaluate, yet it is costing millions of euro. In 2001 there were 16 people working on the project and now there are 27. Nobody seems to know what has been achieved. The technology is outdated. Less is being achieved in terms of screening than in areas where there is no pilot programme. Lives are being lost while we proceed with this farce. Why do we stick with it? It has been a disaster by any standard. Is it not time to abandon it rather than review it and roll out a proper programme nationally into which some thought has been put? This is not a pilot programme in any real sense – it is not even a programme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I take the Deputy's point, but that is the reason we need to get it right if we are to roll it out nationally. The review is being conducted by a UK consultant cytopathologist, Dr. Euphemia McGoogan, who is a renowned international expert in the area of cervical screening. Before we consider rolling out the project further it is important that we carry out a proper review. It will be a similar process to that which pertained for the BreastCheck programme, which was nearly two years in preparation before we started phase one.A total of 74,000 women are being screened annually. The Deputy was correct about the uptake, which is about 30%.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	640	It is less.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	641	These are the figures I have received. There is an issue with ongoing routine screening around the country. We have put extra money into routine screening to bring waiting times down. Contracting out testing, especially to laboratories in Northern Ireland, has resulted in a significant reduction in waiting times in a range of laboratories. This represents some progress. Waiting times are being reduced in Cork Univer sity Hospital, where it is a huge problem, and Sligo General Hospital. We have problems with this across the country but waiting times are being reduced in many places.In terms of the national roll-out and the wider cervical screening programme, it is necessary to get it right. We must use whatever resources we have to target those most in need, especially those who do not self-refer. That is exactly what is taking place.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	642	While I agree with the Minister that we have to get it right, we are not going to do so by trying to evaluate something that is an obvious failure. The Minister referred to a backlog. Last July, Limerick hospital was promised money to use the more up to date liquid-based cytology but has not received the money. It is probably the only area in the country that has not progressed.Some months ago the Minister told me that smears from Cork were being sent to Belfast. Belfast is progressing to more modern technology and will not be able to read those smears. We must make decisions in this area. This is an area of screening where the jury is not out. It works and saves lives. While I can see the Minister throwing his eyes up to heaven, this is an area where screening works.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I take the Deputy's point. The review is a major part of the roll-out of the national programme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The summary public capital programme 2004 was published on Thursday, 13 November by the Department of Finance as part of the Abridged Estimates Volume 2004. A figure of €63.5 million was inadvertently included as an issue towards the restructuring of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. A technical contingency provision of £50 million –€63.5 million – was included in the 2001 and 2002 budget arithmetic arising from the 1999 White Paper on private health insurance. It was never drawn down or paid over. The figure was included in error in this year's summary public capital programme, PCP,  and will not appear in the final PCP. An erratum to the AEV will issue to correct the error.The Government has not been presented with proposals, nor has it made any decision, to privatise VHI. The only decision related to VHI's corporate status is that in the White Paper which allows for it to be moved to the position of a public limited company. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government at an early date for legislation in that regard. Whether such legislation should contain provision for further change in VHI's status has not been decided, but will be given consideration in the context of the proposal being prepared by my Department for Government.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I accept the Minister's explanation that there was an error in the inclusion of this figure. However, this raises questions about the issue of the money. Was there a policy of allocating money over the past two years with the intention of privatising the VHI and now that the money is not available, are we in danger of seeing the organisation being privatised? It seems curious that the Department of Finance would allocate money for two years running for the purpose of privatisation yet the Minister informs us there are no plans for this. The Labour Party would not support the privatisation of the VHI and I hope there are no such plans. If this money was allocated to the VHI over the past two years, was it not possible to use it in the health service that badly needs additional funding?The greater the VHI's profits, the greater the increase in premia. Why is this the case? There has been an extraordinary increase of something like 48% in premia over the past four years. Will the Minister assure us that we are not seeing a pattern where, as the VHI becomes increasingly profitable, the public is asked to pay higher subscription charges? In making changes to the charges regimes, the Minister is adding to costs. Will he assure us there will be no further increases in VHI subscriptions in 2004?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	648	Money was not allocated; it was neither drawn down nor paid over. When the White Paper was published, it stated that funding would be needed to provide for a once-off financial injection of £50 million to facilitate the restructuring of the VHI. The reserves of the VHI were considered to be well below the level usually required to seek authorisation as an insurer. The reserves have increased significantly in the interim. The premium increases have facilitated the build-up of reserves and, while we have been criticised for this, it is an example of good practice. It is no longer considered necessary to inject that level of money into the VHI were it to be privatised. The VHI would now be expected to stand on its own if it were to be privatised in the event of the Government taking such a decision.Commercial freedom in a competitive market is an aspiration most Members of the House  would share. As regards pricing, there is an issue whether Ministers should interfere in the company. With the exception of the issues around inflation and the maintenance of the social partnership agreement, my general philosophy is that a Minister should not try to run the VHI. It would be the wrong thing to do. Neither should the Minister try to second-guess the VHI on its day-to-day operational activities.The Deputy is correct in saying its profits have increased. However, the three to four year expectations of the company do not indicate that it will realise similar profits year on year. I accept that these are estimates and plans put forward by the VHI. If we move to commercial freedom and believe in it, the VHI will have to set prices it feels it can command within the marketplace.The VHI argues that health inflation and technology costs are increasing at enormous rates. We know this is a fact in the international health environment. Health expenditure, in both private and public contexts, is increasing across the globe. For example, there has been an enormous increase in the number of MRI scans carried out this year compared with the number carried out five years ago.There is an equity issue at play regarding my decision to increase private bed charges. It is estimated that the major teaching hospitals receive 50% of the real cost of a private bed from the private health insurers. The White Paper identified this in 1999 and said it was unacceptable and should be dealt with.

In doing so, we will have full regard to the demographic and geographic factors affecting each region. The measures proposed will greatly improve services for patients. The proposals will bring services closer to local communities by providing a range of specialties not available there. A central tenet of the report is that patients should not have to travel outside their own region other than for the limited number of treatments that, for quality reasons, must be provided on a supra-regional or national basis. The report offers substantially improved acute hospital services to all, and the Government is committed to implementing it on this basis.

Does the Minister accept that there is a lack of support within the Cabinet and Government circles, as witnessed by the statements of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith and the presence of Fianna Fáil Deputies at the 15,000-strong demonstration in Ennis last weekend?Does the Minister believe that these Deputies have, somehow, misunderstood the implications of the Hanly report? Did the 15,000 people who demonstrated in Ennis misunderstand its implications or are they simply misguided or misinformed? What is the Minister's definition of downgrading? Does the removal of acute beds and accident and emergency services constitute downgrading? Why can the Minister not tell the House the unvarnished truth?We have seen endless procrastination on the first Hanly report. We now understand that Hanly II, the sequel, is in the pipeline. When will Hanly II be published and what does the Taoiseach mean by demographics and geographics?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	653	On all sides of the House many people who are close to the health policy, such as health spokespersons and so on, see merit in the Hanly report. Many have argued for multidisciplinary teams and a consultant-provided service to be put in place. There has never been an argument about those central tenets. We all agreed that we should have a consultant-provided service and greater services to the regions across a range of specialties, including dermatology, rheumatology and neurology, where regions currently lack basic services in some of those specialties. No one in the House has argued that we should not reduce junior doctor hours to 48 per week. We are all in favour of doubling the number of consultants, providing a consultant-provided service, reducing doctor hours and establishing multidisciplinary teams and centres of excellence.At this point some people part company with the model. I hear these differences articulated at national level by party spokespeople. Across the House there are genuine concerns among Deputies from particular regions about what the report means for their local hospitals. That is a reasonable position and I accept that Deputies will have concerns. The challenge for those of us who formulate policy is to listen to those concerns and try to meet them within the parameters we have set ourselves. Mr. Hanly was given challenging terms of reference, not least the 48 hour working week.It is important that we do not move to an extreme interpretation of the task force report. Mr. Hanly has not proposed the closure of any  hospital or any accident and emergency department.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The Hanly report is concerned with patient care. The task force makes it clear that before anything can happen the first major development needed is further training and investment in the ambulance service, particularly training to the level of advanced emergency medical technician. That is a key component part of the Hanly recommendations, and nothing can happen until that happens.The industrial relations issues of the renegotiation of the consultants' contract and the reduction of the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors must be resolved. No service will be transferred from one hospital to another until the necessary investment is made and the necessary facilities put in place to enable hospitals to fulfil the roles given to them.We intend to put project teams in the Mid-Western Health Board and the East Coast Area Health Board regions which will include representatives of the local hospitals and will be independently chaired. These project teams will work out the details on the ground in each region. Phase two, which was signalled in the Government decision of last June and in the October announcement of the Hanly report, will cover the rest of the country.Demographic and geographic considerations mean that people living in Donegal and on the western seaboard, for example, have considerations. Of course there are geographic issues which must be considered in organising acute hospital services in the future. That is what the Taoiseach meant and that is why the Government put it into the decision.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	663	The Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the national task force on medical staffing. The measures proposed will greatly improve services for patients by developing a consultant-provided service, reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and reorganising acute hospital services, including the achievement of regional self-sufficiency.In the two phase one regions studied in depth by the task force – the east coast and mid-west – I will shortly be appointing project groups to progress detailed implementation at local level. This will include identifying the exact services to be provided in major and local hospitals in the two regions and the medical staffing implications of these changes. No changes will be made in services until hospitals have the required facilities and staffing to take on the new roles proposed for them.I will shortly appoint a group chaired by Mr. David Hanly to examine how acute hospital services in the rest of the country should be reorganised in line with the principles of the task force report. These principles include taking full account of geographic and demographic considerations. The group will work closely with my Department and, on its establishment, with the national hospitals office.In the two phase one regions, I anticipate that implementation of the changes in acute hospital services and increases in consultant staffing will progress over the coming years. For the rest of the country, I propose that implementation should commence as soon as the phase two report has been completed in conjunction with the national hospitals office and considered by the Government. The task force report envisages that the full implementation of its proposals for a consultant-provided service would take place over a ten year period.I will shortly be appointing project groups to progress detailed implementation at local level in the two regions studied by the task force. The project groups will be asked to identify the exact services to be provided in major and local hospitals in the two regions.In addition, I will soon appoint a group to advise on the reorganisation of acute hospital services nationally. This will be chaired by Mr. David Hanly. It will be asked to apply the principles of the task force report to the rest of the country and to devise a national plan for the reorganisation of acute hospital services.

Mr. Hanly is very clear about the accident and emergency services to be provided by local hospitals.

Critical to the template is the first responder service, the ambulance service. This is the No. 1 critical provision which must be made. There must be training to emergency medical technician level. Second, there must be a strong primary care infrastructure, which is manifested in the GP co-operative approach and gives better round the clock primary care cover. Third, Hanly recommends the provision of an additional range of services to hospitals and more services to those hospitals than they currently have. There is provision in terms of what each hospital should do.We must appoint a project team for the two regions to work out the details of the Hanly recommendations in so far as they apply to the hospitals. There will be representatives on the project team from the areas and from the hospitals in the areas who can influence developments. I also envisage the team being chaired by an independent chairman.

Ennis hospital also needs upgrading and the Hanly recommendations will not stop this, if this is what  people fear. I have made it clear that services will not be switched or changed until there has been investment in specific facilities in hospitals to accommodate that change. One should bear in mind that much of what Hanly has proposed is de facto already in place in many regions.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	673	In Ennis on Saturday the representative of the consultants, Dr. Hennessey, stated that the golden hour, which is the first hour after an emergency, be it a serious accident or a heart attack, is vital. I have verified this statement. During the day, it takes two and a half hours to travel from west Clare to the Mid-West Regional Hospital. Does the Minister agree with the view of Dr. Hennessey and the consultants that, based on their calculations and experience, nine to ten lives are likely to be lost annually?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The medical advice to Hanly is that a first response based on good training is critical in the cases of heart attacks or road accidents. Many accidents happen in locations that may be an hour or two from a hospital, as we know. What is needed is a strategically well-resourced and expanded service in the regions thus affected.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I am not saying that. At present, senior consultants are not in hospitals after 8 p.m. anyway. We have junior doctors in place who can certainly be of assistance in the case of an accident. We do not have senior clinical decision makers in our hospitals at midnight or 2 a.m.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Does the Minister accept the concept of the golden hour?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	678	As I stated in my speech on the Hanly report, the critical intervention has to be the first response. This can often be on the part of the emergency medical technician. We should not eliminate this from the equation.The Hanly report was largely influenced by medics of significant experience, qualifications and status who would not want to make proposals that would risk life. It is not the business of the medics on the Hanly group to make proposals in a premeditated fashion that would somehow cause injury, damage or loss of life.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	679	There are other questions on the Hanly report and therefore we will move on to Question No. 76.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	680	That should also be accepted as we enter into this debate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The Abridged Estimates for 2004 were published last week by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. They show an increase of €891 million in health spending, bringing the total spend for 2004 to €10.05 billion, including capital. This is an increase of 10% on the Revised Estimate for 2003 and an increase of 10.4% on the Revised Estimate of last year in respect of day-to-day current spending. Given the overall increase in spending on public services, this additional €891 million underlines the Government's commitment to maintaining health spending into 2004.Having secured an increase of 10%, which is almost double the overall Government increase in spending, my challenge is to manage this budget in the best interests of patient care. In accordance with legislation, the letters of determination to the health boards must be sent out by my Department within three weeks of the publication of the Abridged Estimates.The additional funding will provide for the effects in 2004 of Sustaining Progress, benchmarking for public servants in the health sector and a number of technical adjustments to the health Vote. Pay costs form a significant part of overall expenditure in a labour-intensive sector such as that of health. The pay bill, inclusive of benchmarking, will require an additional €500 million in 2004. The health service depends critically on being able to continue to recruit high-calibre staff in all disciplines in a highly mobile area where the international competition for health staff is intense.Additional funding of €187 million is being made available to meet the increased cost of the general medical services scheme. This represents an increase of 19%. Additional funding of €50 million is being provided to meet the increasing costs of the drugs payment scheme.The Estimate also provides €32 million for the treatment purchase fund, which will ensure that 9,500 of those waiting longest will be treated in 2004. This is in addition to €43 million for waiting list activity.Capital funding of €509 million will be provided in 2004 to facilitate further improvement of health infrastructure. This will allow for progress, from planning to construction, on projects throughout the country. Funding for information systems and related services has doubled to €60 million. This capital funding will be used to bring the health services into the information age.On the provision of additional beds in 2004, my first priority will be to maximise capacity within the existing hospital system. I will have the flexibility to prioritise selected areas within the overall funding available to me, but that will not allow  for the commissioning of new capacity in the acute hospitals during the coming year.There will be an increase in the income for public hospitals from the charges raised by these hospitals from private beds. This increase will be 15%, thus providing additional income of €20 million. This income goes towards supporting services in public hospitals and therefore is part of their budgets. Even with this increase, the cost of providing services to private patients in those hospitals is far greater than the income from the private insurance companies. In the major teaching hospitals, for example, it is estimated that the income from private beds represents less than half the cost of treating private patients. In the interests of equity, it is Government policy to eliminate this subsidy gradually. The increase being implemented will, in a small way, close the gap.There will also be an increase of €5 in the statutory in-patient bed charge, bringing it to €45 per night. Accident and emergency charges are also being increased by €5 to €45, which will contribute to meeting the growing costs of providing accident and emergency services but will also help avoid inappropriate attendances at accident and emergency units where an alternative may be available. There will also be an increase in the current threshold of €70 per month to €78 per month for the drugs payment scheme.Additional informationAs the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, especially those with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary position, I regret that it will not be possible to meet this commitment next year, but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its term of office.

Does he agree that raising the qualified threshold for refunds of the cost of medicine under the drugs payment scheme and the increased cost of access to accident and emergency services will further penalise those to whom the Minister's party promised to extend the medical card scheme in advance of last year's general election, that is, some 200,000 citizens? These are the very people who, in the first instance, are marginally above the income limits for qualification for a medical card and yet clearly cannot afford private medical cover. They will now be charged more, in many instances – I do not say this glibly – for lying on trolleys in accident and emergency units in different sites, given that time will show that many sites will actually  remain in different parts of the country, as I know from my experience in Monaghan. When the Minister talks of the Hanly report as a blueprint, we know exactly from where he borrowed the idea. My area was the experimentation ground.My question sometimes seems to have fallen off the table over the past 12 months. Where is the provision in this Book of Estimates to cover the political promise made to the 200,000 people to extend to them the general medical card scheme? A commitment was made and I see no provision in the Estimate. Will the Minister address this specifically?I noted the Minister's reference in his reply to private beds in the public hospitals. He indicated he has increased the cost in that area by some 15%. I noted that BUPA has stated it does not intend to pass on this charge at least until the coming year. This is no big deal because it is only a month away. What of the VHI? In recent years the Minister approved substantial increases in the cost of voluntary health insurance. What guarantees can he give that we are not faced with a further year of significant increases in VHI costs which many find difficult to afford? Many families place themselves in financial hardship to obtain private health cover. What does the Minister propose to do or what guarantees can he offer that they will not now face a further significant rise in the cost of private health care?Does the Minister agree that all these factors demonstrate the wholly unacceptable folly of the continual acceptance by his Government and previous ones of the two-tier system that obtains in our hospitals? Does he also agree that, until such time as we have a real reforming Minister with the support of a reforming Cabinet dedicated to health care provision, these injustices and inequities will continue?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	687	It is paradoxical. One cannot say on the one hand—

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	691	To be fair, the Deputy has made a broader proposition. We need to look at the wider picture. For example, investment in the treatment purchase fund is a considerable commitment which we are honouring. It is also delivering significant equity in terms of waiting times which have dramatically reduced for those waiting longest.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	692	They have fallen by 3%.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	693	This is particularly the case with regard to those who were waiting more than 12 months when the treatment purchase fund was initiated. Virtually all of them have since been treated. In terms of equity in cardiovascular and cancer policy, we have made dramatic improvements in cancer treatment in the areas of diagnostics, screening, treatment and interventions and a number of additional consultants have been appointed. These improvements apply across the entire population, irrespective of whether one has money. We have made significant progress on the cardiovascular front in terms of surgical interventions. In addition, I receive positive feedback from patients every day about the cardiac rehabilitation programme.One can isolate certain areas in which there has been a negative development. I do not like increasing charges and agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin on this issue. Every politician would prefer to be in a position not to have to increase charges. The Government has, however, dramatically increased access to the drug payment scheme. Under the previous scheme, people had to apply to their health board for refunds, which many did not bother to do. We changed that system with dramatic results. The combined cost in 1998 of the two older schemes was, I believe, around €94 million, while the cost of the current scheme is €192 million each year.We are, therefore, increasing resources for the drug payment scheme and more people are availing of it. Drugs are becoming more expensive and as a consequence we have increased the threshold from €70 to €78. While I am not enthused about having to impose this increase, which will probably yield about €10 million, it is taking place in the context of a budget which has risen from about €98 million to €192 million.

This is not the first time I have not received an answer to my questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The Deputy asked about ten questions.

How will the promised additional acute hospital beds be provided for from the Estimate? Is the Minister aware that the Irish Nurses Organisation has indicated that rather than providing for additional beds, the current complement will be difficult to maintain under the figures provided in the Book of Estimates?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I have already answered the question on medical card provision. We regret we are not in a position to provide for the expansion of the general medical card scheme to a further 200,000 people. Notwithstanding this, the budget for the scheme will increase by €187 million. The commitments made in the programme for Government have a five-year lifespan attached to them. We do not do everything in the first two years of Government and if the budgetary position improves—

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 81, 99, 125 and 139 together.I will shortly appoint project groups to progress detailed implementation at local level in the two regions studied by the task force. The project groups will be asked to identify the exact services to be provided in major and local hospitals in the two regions. In addition, I will soon appoint a group to advise on the reorganisation of acute hospital services nationally. The group will be chaired by David Hanly and will be asked to apply the principles of the task force's report to the rest of the country and to devise a national plan for the reorganisation of acute hospital services. In doing so, it will be asked to have particular regard to the demographic and geographic factors affecting local communities. It will also have full regard to the requirements of the European Working Time Directive, which requires substantial reductions in the average number of hours worked by our non-consultant hospital doctors.I emphasise that no changes in services are proposed until hospitals have the required facilities and staffing to take on the new roles proposed for them. The training of emergency medical technicians to advanced standard will be a key requirement in this regard.

As I did not have a chance to ask a supplementary question earlier because I was cut short, I want to make the point that the controls on time are slightly ad hoc. I hope I am treated fairly.As regards the pilot areas, the Minister has announced his intention to set up implementation bodies. Will he answer the obvious criticism which will be levied at him as a result of his track record, namely, that we are still waiting for the promised national implementation body, chaired  by an independent chairperson, due to be announced in mid-October? In the meantime the process which developed out of the Brennan report has become bogged down in bureaucracy.When precisely will the implementation bodies for the two pilot areas be established? Will democratically-elected public representatives have a voice on these bodies? Does the Minister not recognise that there is a growing feeling among many people outside the medical establishment that the Hanly report was dominated by hospital consultants and did not sufficiently address or recognise the needs of patients?In his reply to an earlier question, the Minister used the vague sentence that it would take a number of years for the pilot area changes to be instituted. What does this mean? Will they be long-fingered due to lack of funds or dissension in the ranks of Government? Why have guinea pigs if the pilot schemes will be quickly overtaken by Hanly II, due for publication next August, which the Minister indicated will result in the extension of the schemes to the rest of the country?With regard to the east coast area, is the Minister aware that one of the hospital accident and emergency departments he intends closing, St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, is treating 500 patients on an average, typical week and that the equivalent figure for St. Vincent's Hospital, which is due to become a major hospital, is about 780 patients? Does he have any concept—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I must intervene. The Deputy has greatly exceeded the minute allocated to ask questions.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	708	I will conclude. I am merely matching everybody else as a matter of honour. Does the Minister have any appreciation of the demand which will be exerted on St. Vincent's Hospital's accident and emergency department if he proceeds to close St. Colmcille's Hospital accident and emergency department in line with the recommendations of the Hanly report? He should not shake his head, nor repeat nonsense about minor injuries units.

On another day and in a less politically charged atmosphere Deputy McManus would agree with much of the report. She has in the past agreed with the need to move to a consultant provided service and to reduce hospital doctors' working hours to 48 hours per week. People cannot have a bet each way and every way, which is what the Members are seeking.With regard to Loughlinstown, the accident and emergency department will not be closed down. We are not closing down a department and moving every patient to another department.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	737	Order. Please allow the Minister to reply.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I am not changing it. The Deputy should read page 68 of the report. It deals with certain agreements. It is probably not on a 24 hour basis in terms of accident and emergency.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	739	There will be no accident and emergency department to deal with small injuries.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	740	The Deputy is well aware that we do not have senior consultants on a 24 hour basis. What is she talking about?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The Minister is not talking about junior hospital doctors but about consultant provided services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	742	We do not even have that at present. People are talking about 24 hour cover when we do not have it in terms of senior consultant provision. Everybody says we should have it. No services will be transferred until facilities are in place and investment is made. Nothing will happen until there is an ambulance service in place which can provide the type of EMTA training that is required.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	743	It will never happen.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	744	People can draw certain conclusions from the Hanly report and hype them for political purposes. That is the game in the political arena but it does not do justice to the future of the health care system.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	745	Does the Minister agree that the Hanly report is just one plan among many? It is not the holy grail and it is not our patriotic duty to accept it in total, as has been indicated. That is extremely arrogant. Given that so many people agree with much of the content of the report and that it is the arrangements for accident and emergency departments that are causing distress,  would it not be bull headed to stick slavishly to that aspect without considering what people actually want?The report states that an irreducible number of 21 consultants must be on site. Most hospitals have never had that and it is not what they want. People are choosing something similar to what they have at present. Surely it is not beyond human ingenuity to provide 24 hour cover in many of the hospitals throughout the country and still proceed with many of the principles which underlie Hanly. That must be possible.The Minister says that nothing will happen until services such as the ambulance service and the improvement of local GP services are in place. How does that fit in with the implementation of the working time directive next August in the two pilot areas? There is a 16 week cycle and within 16 weeks of 1 August we will know if the target of 58 hours per week is being met. If not, and it will be extremely difficult to meet it, what will happen to those hospitals, given that nothing will happen until the ambulances and so forth are in place? How will it be possible to have those services in place by this time next year?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	746	The Hanly report will not be implemented by this time next year.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The Minister said it should be.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The working time directive has to be implemented.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The working time directive has until 2009 to run.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	750	The hours have to be reduced to 58 hours.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The Deputy asked a fair question. The terms of reference the Hanly group received related to reducing junior doctors' hours to 48, achieving a consultant provided service and organising an acute hospital service from that. I am not saying that when we establish the project team it will follow every syllable of the report. The project team will take the principles in the report on board and see how they reflect into the locality. The team will include representatives from the local hospitals and will be independently chaired. There will be flexibility for the local group in arriving at its conclusions.I have already asked the House for a substantive alternative to this report. It is fine to knock and condemn the report but I challenged the House last week to come up with a substantive alternative—
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	752	It is a little disingenuous to ask us to come up with an alternative.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	753	—in the context of the working time directive. It is a fair question.Over the last number of years, as the Oireachtas and the Governments have watched,  the College of Anaesthetists, the College of Surgeons and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have been making new rules and drawing up new guidelines to comply with international best practice. These are having a huge impact on whether accident and emergency services or surgery continues in hospitals. We can continue to ignore that phenomenon or do what I am trying to do, which is to put a blueprint in place that will offer a degree of certainty about what will happen over the next ten to 15 years. For the last four years I have watched hospital after hospital getting into difficulty because of this phenomenon. We need to deal with it in a proactive way.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	754	It is not coincidental that Deputy Killeen has decided to grace the House with his presence at this point.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I am present at least as often as the Deputy.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	756	Who is telling the truth about the Hanly report, Deputy Killeen or the Minister? The Minister has vehemently and repeatedly assured the House that accident and emergency services will not be downgraded in Ennis and other hospitals. Deputy Killeen is telling his constituents something different, that they will be downgraded but that he will stop it. What is the truth?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	757	Another untruth from Deputy Gormley, unsurprisingly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	758	My colleague, Brian Meaney, will stop it if he has his way. The Minister spoke about the challenging terms of reference given to the Hanly group and said that people wanted an every way bet. If matters remain as they are, the Hanly report is not implemented in terms of the downgrading of accident and emergency units and the working time directive is implemented and we comply with it, what extra expenditure will be required? I have seen the extra expenditure required in Germany for compliance with the directive and keeping the system as it is. If things stay as they are and we comply with the directive, what extra cost will it involve?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	759	Hanly originally costed the changing of the ratio between junior doctors and consultants at approximately €100 million in today's prices. In other words, the number of junior doctors would remain as it is and the number of consultants would double. Given the closer proximity in pay scales between the two in recent years because of the pay deal concluded in 2000, the costs are not as exorbitant as they might have been under the older pay structures that prevailed prior to 2000.I passionately believe in a consultant provided service. I do not wish to encourage more marches but it is worrying that thousands did not march  to protest the fact that there is only one rheumatologist in the mid-west and only one neonatologist on the western seaboard.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	760	There were 15,000 marching against the Hanly report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	761	I acknowledge the importance of accident and emergency service provision but we need to change the way we have historically planned the development of acute hospital services. It has evolved in a patchy way with a concentration of services in the east. This concentration has moved somewhat to Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and there have been other developments throughout the country. However, many people in the west still have to travel to Dublin, as do many in the south-east and the mid-west, for a range of specialties that should be provided within those regions. The positive benefit that can result from the Hanly report is stopping that one-way traffic from the regions.Deputy Killeen has every right to be in the House. He has always been a consistent advocate for Ennis General Hospital.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	762	Like the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, in Nenagh.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	763	No, he wants to work constructively with the Hanly proposals.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	764	He is posturing.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	765	He has communicated likewise to me long before there was any brouhaha about the issue.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I have a specific question on the remit of the project groups in the pilot areas. Will they be in a position to address the perceived consultation deficit in the Hanly report? I am not sure whether the deficit is the fault of the consultants in the group who prepared the plan or the consultants and others in the areas. Will the project groups examine the accurate numbers put through accident and emergency in Ennis, for example, which caters for 22,000 people rather than the 15,000 which has been considered? The project groups will undoubtedly examine the geography and the demographics and reach inevitable conclusions. It would be helpful if the criteria for general hospitals were set out more clearly than at present and if the project groups were enabled to examine the relative cost benefits or otherwise of proceeding along the Hanly route or the more sensible route of improving the level of services in the existing acute hospitals.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	767	What are the inevitable conclusions?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	768	In answer to the first question, the local project teams will be in a position to consult local interests in working out what is required by  way of additionality, including services and facilities. On the accuracy of numbers, this should be ascertained in an area if there are issues around the numbers attending accident and emergency departments and so on. I am informed that the vast majority of people turn up in accident and emergency departments between 8 a.m. and midnight, which is the critical period. An analysis of figures is important. Some of us might be surprised to discover the numbers who turn up in accident and emergency departments.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	769	It is more than the Minister thinks.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	770	The issues of accident and emergency and medical cover to which Deputies Killeen and Olivia Mitchell referred are the two issues that have been crystallised in recent weeks. I welcome the debate because it is a long time since we have had a decent debate on acute hospital services. I put out a challenge last week that I would be prepared to examine the issues if there was a substantial alternative to the way we do business in the context of the parameters set in terms of the 48 hour working week and the consultant-based service.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	771	Will the Minister accept that we need to have a truthful debate? Will he consider what the Hanly report said, namely, that St. Colmcille's Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh Hospital should function as local hospitals?I am sure the Minister will agree that one of the redeeming features of the Hanly report is its clarity. It states that a feature of the local hospital is that it would provide a nurse-led minor injury unit for an extended day intake, for example, and that all major traumas and medical emergencies would go directly to the major hospital. There is nothing clearer than this. It also states there should not be a requirement for on-site medical presence overnight or at weekends, but that would take a little longer.The Minister must be honest and accept that the Hanly report states that there should be no 24 hour accident and emergency service in these hospitals run by doctors with nurses. They will become local hospitals with minor injury units – a daytime service provided by nurses. This is not an accident and emergency department in anyone's language.On Deputy Killeen's question, will the Minister explain the range of consultation that will be held given that the Hanly report is so specific in its recommendations and the Government was so specific and made a clear statement that it supported and would implement the report, although it is now becoming a case of whatever you are having yourself? Consultation will not change the facts because the Hanly report is specific about the end of accident and emergency services in St. Colmcille's Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Ennis General Hospital and Nenagh Hospital.  Let us not divert from the facts as stated in the report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The facts are not as articulated by the Deputy. The Hanly report does not advocate closing accident and emergency departments and sending every patient who turns up at them elsewhere. The Deputy is working a clever play on language. She says that, if accident and emergency as a title is gone, the accident and emergency department is closed. The reality under the Hanly proposals is that 70% of those who attend at accident and emergency departments will continue to do so in the same department.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	773	That is not the case because nurses will provide the service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	774	The Deputy inquired about the Hanly report. The context I have outlined is the true one in which the proposals around accident and emergency departments are framed.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	775	Just because nurses—
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	776	Hanly did not invent this. I made a point earlier about the Royal College of Surgeons. I can list the hospitals over the past three to four years that were under threat in terms of their accident and emergency departments. We had to intervene and work agreements with the Medical Council or with the college to preserve accreditation for junior doctors in some of these hospitals to maintain surgery on-call, including accident and emergency services overnight.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	777	Underfunding?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I could list seven, eight or nine hospitals where we have had these difficulties and challenges. It is better to try to plan a blueprint for the future which would end that uncertainty. In the intervening years, the Government set up a forum comprising the colleges and the Medical Council to try to avoid sudden jolts to the service because of accreditation issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The Minister has exceeded his one minute.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The Medical Council visited Ennis over two years ago and produced a report. There had to be sudden interventions to meet the requirements of the hospital, the health boards and the Medical Council to reach a workable agreement. This cannot go on forever.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	781	I want to ask the Minister one simple question. When David Hanly was in Ennis last week, he said that the report was the Bible and that no aspects of it could be changed. He said it would have to be implemented in full. Does the Government propose that there could be changes to the Hanly report, especially where the 24 hour accident and emergency service is concerned, to suit the backbenchers and the  15,000 people who marched last week in Ennis? There will be more marches on this issue. Is there room for manoeuvre on the Hanly report, especially on accident and emergency services?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I have replied to this issue already in terms of the need for people to come up with substantive alternatives.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	783	Is there room for manoeuvre?
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The Minister is asking us to come up with alternatives.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	785	I am not. The Government has accepted the Hanly report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Order, please. The Minister is in possession.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	787	It is disingenuous to ask the Opposition to come up with alternatives to the Hanly report. The Government is three years—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The Deputy is being disorderly. She has not been called.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	789	The Hanly group has produced the blueprint. It goes back to 1998 when the Manpower forum was formed. Much of this is not new. It has been well signalled, not just by the Hanly group but by other professional bodies, in terms of accreditation and so on. Obviously people have political and other concerns.In regard to working out the Hanly report principles in a local context, it has been signalled that project groups should be established in both these regions to work through and flesh out the details of the report in so far as they apply to the services in the mid-west or the east coast area.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Is there room for change?
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	791	As a general practitioner I am concerned about one aspect. The Minister said that 70% of people will continue to attend accident and emergency departments. I am concerned about the 30% of patients with a serious illness who will not receive the treatment they require.Let us take the case of Ennis which I visited last week. Some may have to travel 70 miles to Ennis. There is a golden hour. No matter what one does, one cannot do anything for the man with the ruptured spleen who is bleeding internally. He has a greater risk of dying if he has to get to Limerick hospital. It is not possible to give him the service he requires which is an emergency operation. Unless helicopter emergency medical services are available and he is adjacent to the hospital – Ennis is more adjacent than Limerick – the bottom line is that man will not survive. Has the Minister considered helicopter emergency medical services? It has been mentioned in the Hanly report. That is a service that is badly  needed. In the context of Hanly such a service is definitely needed.I cannot see how Hanly can be implemented by downgrading Ennis General Hospital which will be a nurse-led unit. I was in that unit last week. It reminded me of Mayo General Hospital before money was invested in it. What that hospital needs is to have money invested in it and not taken out of it. If one is looking for an alternative that is it – invest in Ennis General Hospital. I cannot understand why some of the 24-hour consultants cannot be sent to Ennis General Hospital where there is a greater need for them than in Limerick. What is to happen to those 22,000 cases who are seen at Ennis General Hospital? To where will they go? Limerick Regional Hospital cannot cope at present. This is pie in the sky and the Minister knows that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	792	On the issue of trauma, some health boards, even those in the mid-west, recommend that people should be taken to the major hospital. That also applies in other parts of the country. What the Hanly group says is that the first line of response in this area would be a properly-trained ambulance service, up to emergency medical technician advanced stage.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	793	He cannot perform an operation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I am not saying he can. In the event of a major road accident, even before one gets to any hospital, be it a local or a major hospital, one could still be an hour or two away from a hospital, given the topography and rural nature of the country. The first prerequisite in the implementation of the Hanly report is to get that EMTA training in place and to get a properly expanded and strategically placed ambulance service in place. During the past three or four years we have invested significantly in the ambulance service and significant progress has been made.The Deputy asked about a helicopter service. We have undertaken a feasibility study on such a service with the authorities in Northern Ireland. My priority would be to build up the ambulance fleet on the ground first, in every part of the country, to give adequate coverage to every part of the country.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	795	Geographic and demographic considerations are fudging the issue. As Deputy McManus said, we want clarity. Were the geographic and demographic factors taken into consideration by Hanly in the pilot areas or can the implementation groups take into consideration the geographic and demographic factors? Is it Hanly, the implementation groups or both who take them into account?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	796	Will the Minister accept there are serious implications for a number of hospitals throughout the country contained in the Hanly report, some of which have been mentioned? Will he clarify what undertakings he has given to his  backbenchers in the discussions he has had with them recently on this matter? Has it been determined that a rolling scrum will roll around the countryside meeting the expectations of all those concerned depending on where they might be, or is it intended to wait until after the next general election to pull the plug on all those hospitals in their entirety?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy O'Shea – the need to control excessive prices for alcohol, soft drinks and food being charged by some pubs, clubs and restaurants; (2) Deputy Finneran – the need to address the anomaly and cost factor that exists for insurance between the voluntary secondary school and the community or vocational school; (3) Deputy Cowley – to ask the Minister if it is intended to try and implement taxation on bean an tís in this year's budget, given that bean an tís  are currently allowed to derive 10% of their total income from students learning Irish without being subject to tax and that the effect of the abolition of this tax relief for bean an tís would be to severely damage or completely destroy this valuable rural enterprise which fosters our national language; (4) Deputy Moloney – the need to provide funding for the inner relief road around Mountmellick in County Laois; (5) Deputy Richard Bruton – the need to replace immediately two disintegrating pre-fabs at Scoil Catríona, Coolock, by modern pre-fabs; (6) Deputy Broughan – the urgent need to bring forward the mercantile marine (amendment) Bill in view of allegations that the Irish flag is becoming a flag of convenience following recent additions to the Irish registry of shipping; (7) Deputy Jim O'Keeffe – the urgent need to proceed with the agreed extension to Clonakilty community college; and (8) Deputy Allen – the investigations carried out by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the sale of two pieces of land by Navan UDC and Meath County Council to a company (details supplied) in 1995 and 1999, respectively, and the reasons why a full independent inquiry was not carried out.The matters raised by Deputies O'Shea, Finneran, Richard Bruton and Jim O'Keeffe have been selected for discussion.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I wish to share time with Deputy Sargent.I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the Book of Estimates 2004. I would like to particularly focus on the health issue and the lack of real action on poverty. There has been much hype from the Minister where the Department of Health and Children got an extra €700 million bringing the budget for the year to €10.5 billion. This may sound good but many citizens and taxpayers wonder why patients are on trolleys in accident and emergency units, the less well-off are dying because of lack of equal access to health care, money talks when it comes to health care; there are 1,382 persons with intellectual disabilities on residential waiting lists, 621 seek day care places, 823 wait for respite care, families are forced to accept services miles away from home, families of children and adults with intellectual disability are forced to accept services in the midlands or in the North and, lifts in hospitals are broken for the past two years.These are the real issues about which our people are concerned. I challenge the Minister and the Government on these issues. These are the issues we should be discussing in the Book of Estimates. We have a Government that appears to care more about horses than people. Why can we not fast-track services for the sick and the poor?If I came up with a project tomorrow morning which would get people off drugs, into education and on to employment thus reducing crime, I would have to go through every bureaucratic hoop in the State to apply for funding and grants. Why then can two Ministers decide to sign in a matter of weeks a project in Punchestown? It is a question of priorities and that is why these Estimates lack the serious commitment to do something about health, education, disadvantage, poverty and social housing.The current two-tier system of health care discriminates against children by providing timely access to care not on the basis of need, but on the grounds of ability to pay. This inequity is reflected in the long waiting lists for public hospital care and the uncovered costs of primary health care for the vast majority of Irish children.  Child poverty is a denial of the basic right of a child to an adequate standard of living, a right guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Minister is breaching this UN Convention. A total of 6.5% of children, approximately 70,000, are living in consistent poverty, 23%, or roughly 300,000, are in relative income poverty. Children in families with three or more children, those living in lone parent households and children of Traveller and asylum-seeking families are particularly at risk of experiencing poverty. The longer a child is poor the greater the impact on the life chances of the child and the subsequent deprivation in later life.I urge the Government to listen to the real issues and the views of real people who want to build a just and inclusive State.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	810	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta McGrath as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. The Government lives by the maxim that the rising tide lifts all boats. We hear this year by year but the widening gap between rich and poor proves that the maxim is not borne out in reality. Instead we have the trickle down principle and the poor are generally left waiting, as is the environment. The modus operandi of Governments whose policies are intrinsically unsustainable is to consume resources to create sufficient wealth in the hope that there will be some left over to repair the damage they do along the way. Unfortunately, we can see from these Estimates that our wealth is gone and what is there is being cut back significantly. There is no repair fund either for the poor or the environment. While food producers are being forced to intensify production and cut corners for competitive reasons the Government makes cutbacks of 46% in agriculture for disease control and eradication. The Government is asking us to fly by the seat of our pants and cross our fingers that we will not run into insurmountable problems. However, all the indications are that the problems are becoming insurmountable.Teagasc grant aid is down 5%, making it very difficult to change with our needs because we do not have the training for various aspects of agriculture, including organic farming. There are 48 outstanding EU directives which are causing the Government some embarrassment as well as court cases, yet the EPA is being asked to do more for integrated pollution control licences. It is facing companies which are self-regulating because the resources are not there to inspect and competition is forcing them to cut costs and corners in so doing but the EPA's funding has been reduced by a whopping 32%. Does the Government really expect to be so blessed that it will withstand the insurmountable problems it is creating and the cutbacks it is making? This applies not just in areas about which we hear every day in our clinics, such as schools and hospitals, but areas about which we hear less often, until there is a disaster when people scratch their heads and ask what happened. The cause  lies here as the Government turns a blind eye to these areas to prevent problems at the outset.The Government is leaving a legacy of uncertainty for future generations who will have to mop up the problems being caused by a Government that does not want to look into the long-term but wants to fool people by taking money away from areas that deal with long-term issues. I ask the Government to grasp the nettle and see the long-term need to support the areas where it has made cutbacks and to audit each Department for sustainability. In this way it will prevent problems rather than waiting for them to happen and having to deal with them in some which way is not possible.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	811	The recently published Abridged Estimates Volume shows a gross total estimate of €10.050 billion for the health service, an increase of 10% on the Revised Estimate for 2003. In ongoing revenue terms, the spending level is over €9.5 billion, representing an increase of €897 million or 10.4% on the equivalent figure in the 2003 Revised Estimates Volume. On the capital side, the 2004 spending level is €509 million. To maintain these achievements in service delivery the health service depends on being able to continue to recruit high calibre staff in all disciplines.Pay costs form a very significant part of overall expenditure in a labour intensive sector such as health. The pay bill inclusive of benchmarking will require an additional €500 million in 2004. Pay rates can be expected to increase significantly in 2004. However, these increases will coincide with clear improvements and public service commitments to modernisation, including co-operation with the health reform programme, better customer service, enhanced skill mix and independently verified performance management. Further funding of €187 million is being made available to meet the increased cost of the general medical scheme. This represents an increase of 19% over the Revised Estimate for 2003. Some progress has been made on efficiencies on the general medical scheme. However, it is clear that the scheme forms a significant part of health expenditure and provides valuable and important services for persons covered by the scheme.The current threshold for the drugs payment scheme of €70 per month will increase to €78 per month, producing a saving of approximately €8 million. Notwithstanding this increase in the threshold, the Estimate must provide an additional €50 million of spending under this scheme. Provision is being made in the Estimates for 2004 for the full year cost of the package of funding announced earlier this year for the intellectual disability sector. This will bring funding under this programme to over €800 million annually. The funding is being made available for services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements, the provision  of day services for young adults who have just left school and some enhancement of the health-related support services for children. The fund provides about 175 emergency places and over 600 day places. This will enable the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to address key issues of concern which have been identified by the various representative groups. This is further evidence of the Government's commitment to these services and to supporting people with disabilities and their families.The Estimate maintains funding of €32 million for the treatment purchase fund, which will ensure that 9,500 of those people waiting longest will be treated in 2004. This is in addition to €43 million provided for waiting list activity, which continues in the current Estimate. We have received a total of €6.55 billion additional funding since 1997, representing a 187% increase. Examining the records over the years since this and the previous Government came into office, it is clear that significant improvements in services have been achieved. Hospital activity is up 28% in that period based on projected figures for this year. In-patient and day case discharges from acute hospitals amounted to 963,000 in 2002. This figure represents approximately 2,600 patients per day being discharged for each day of the year and is an overall increase of over 4 % on the number of discharges in 2001. There was an increase of over 12% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002. It is expected that about one million patients will be treated this year in acute hospitals.Waiting lists continue to fall. This is particularly evident for those waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment. From June 2002 to June 2003 this number decreased by 43%. Similarly, the number of children waiting six months for treatment in target specialties has decreased by 57%. The number of consultant posts has increased by 34% – by the end of 2002 the number of nurses employed had increased by 1,900 and the number of medical and dental staff had increased by 8%.There will also be an increase in the income for public hospitals from the charges raised by hospitals from private beds. That increase of 15% will give additional income of €20 million. This income goes towards supporting services in public hospitals and is therefore part of their budgets. Even with this increase, the cost of providing services to private patients in those hospitals is far greater than the income from the private insurance companies. In the major teaching hospitals, for example, it is estimated that the income from private beds represents about half the costs of treating private patients. In the interests of equity it is Government policy to gradually eliminate the subsidy. The increase being implemented will, in a small way, close the gap.There will also be an increase of €5 in the statutory in-patient bed charge, bringing it to €45 per  night, for a maximum of ten nights a year. Accident and emergency charges are also being increased by €5 to €45. This increase will contribute to meeting the growing costs of providing accident and emergency services but more importantly will facilitate more appropriate attendances at accident and emergency units.Capital funds of €509 million will be provided in 2004 to facilitate further improvement of health infrastructure. This will allow for progress, from planning to construction, on projects throughout the country, including the following: Mater and Temple Street hospitals; radiology, haematology-oncology accommodation and MRI in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children; the first phase of St Vincent"s Hospital, Elm Park; the accident and emergency extension to St James's Hospital; plans for expanded ICU and accommodation for Naas hospital; maternity services at the Coombe Women's Hospital; the cardiac services, renal dialysis unit, maternity unit, accident and emergency department and day procedures unit at Cork University Hospital; the refurbishment of accommodation for older people at the James Connolly Memorial Hospital; planning for replacement accommodation at the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf; the Midland Regional Hospital at Tullamore; acute psychiatric units at Beaumont and Nenagh hospitals; step-down facilities, facilities for patients with Alzheimer's disease, psychiatric services and services for physically handicapped at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel; a unit for older persons at St John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, and at the Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles.The capital funding provided in 2004 will also allow for significant progress to be made on new facilities in the universities and institutes of technology to support the continuation of the nursing degree programme. Funding is also being made available for information systems and related services and this has doubled to €60 million. This capital funding will be used to bring the health services into the information age by supporting a number of "enterprise-wide" system developments which in turn will lead to better, safer and more streamlined services for our clients. Above all it will provide essential information for the management of health services at all levels. It will, I hope, foster an evidence-based approach to this problem. This significant increase in investment in information systems is a direct response to the recommendations in this area as outlined in the Prospectus and Brennan reports.On 18 June, the Government announced the most extensive reform programme for the health system in over 30 years. The Government's decision was based on the audit of structures and functions in the health system carried out by Prospectus and the report of the Brennan Commission on financial management and control systems in the health service. A communications process has been initiated to inform and listen to response from the staff on the ground. Work on  a model of programme management is nearing completion. Terms of reference and membership of action projects to advance specific aspects of the programme are almost finalised.A project office to support the programme is currently being established. A national steering committee is to be established to oversee the implementation process. In addition, a board for the interim health service executive will be appointed. Preparatory work currently nearing completion is the key to the future success of the reform programme. The 2004 funding will support the programme as it develops through the year.The volume and breadth of additional health and children services over recent years is significant by any accepted standard of measurement. I am, of course, acutely aware of the need to meet the goals of the health strategy regarding equity of access, quality of services and the ability to demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and value for money. I am confident that the system is steadily achieving these key objectives. This is demonstrated through the very high performance levels recorded currently in the health system.The current economic climate dictates that Government employs caution and prudence when making decisions on the distribution of resources. The investment of the substantial funding seen in this year's Estimates for the health services is evidence of the Government's commitment to our health services. The challenge for all of us will be to continue to deliver a quality service throughout 2004. I am confident that we have the people and the system to deliver.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	814	Most of the big issues have been dealt with in the debate. It is obvious there is inadequate funding provision for major projects that badly need to be completed. These are missed opportunities because of the narrow thinking of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who refuses to make funding available other than what is coming in from the tax take. This is bound to affect the economy in the future.This is fair enough considering that it is the Minister's economic philosophy. That said, the country will as a result suffer in the long-term. The Minister's failure to fund the smaller items that immediately affect the quality of life of the weakest of our community is his major sin. The provisions for health and education are totally inadequate. The Minister has failed to provide the pittances needed for home help, disabled person's grants, essential repairs grants for the elderly, rent allowances for the homeless, respite care for the handicapped and the elderly, and extra funding for nursing home subvention. He has allowed no increase in the qualifying limit for  the medical card and no basic funding to at least make national schools usable.With any imagination the Minister could have made the money available to properly fund these relatively inexpensive but important schemes. Our elderly cannot afford nursing homes because the Minister refuses to fund proper subvention. They cannot stay at home because of so many cuts in home help funding. Their families are driven to distraction because they cannot install the necessary showers, downstairs bedrooms or stair lifts. Both partners in the household must work to pay the mortgage. They are burdened with the cost of child care facilities and are at their wits end trying to find ways of looking after their elderly relations. The carer's allowance is inadequate and nearly impossible to qualify for, yet the Government continues to devise new stealth taxes every day, a means of indirect taxation that must be paid irrespective of a family's disposable income.The pressure on families has become unbearable, and one of these days the Government will be hit by the anger and frustration building up in these people. Something has to give. Up to now, young couples trying to cater for their families and their elderly have been so busy trying to make ends meet that they have not had the time to demonstrate or revolt, but the Government will push them over the edge. The Minister for Finance and the other Ministers who caved in to his demands for cutbacks cannot have it every way. They cannot refuse to fund the most basic services, namely, care for the elderly and the handicapped, while at the same time adding constantly to people's costs by introducing and increasing stealth taxes.One can add to this the pain, suffering and worry of ordinary people waiting for hip operations and heart surgery, the disappointment of care workers in not being able to provide adequate services for the handicapped and the constant stress and worry of parents who are not sure from day to day if facilities and funding will be made available for them to look after their sons and daughters.I hope it is not yet too late. The Minister can make adjustments in the budget to make money available for these very basic services. I have no doubt that the Irish people would have no problem making some sacrifices to ensure that the weakest in our society are looked after. I do not intend to hold my breath in this instance. The track record of the Government over the past seven years has been one of looking after the rich and famous at the expense of the old, the young and the handicapped.

I often wonder why we bother to launch such documents or spend so much time, energy and funding on drawing them up when at the end of the day there is  no provision for them. Let us be honest with each other.In the few minutes available to me I want to deal with a few agriculture issues. I notice that the former IFA president has arrived in the House.

I am surprised that the farming unions were so welcoming of the Estimates. They seem to have lost their bite. No doubt it will dawn on them in January or February that things are not so good and that the Minister has managed, as he generally does, to massage the figures.Teagasc seems to have been almost abandoned because this time last year there was an outcry at the possible closure of the Teagasc centres. I can inform the House that all those centres threatened with closure and put on hold will now close and they will be joined by others. Centres in Wicklow town, Tullow, Mullinavat will close. I was surprised to hear not a whimper from the farming unions.The Minister has been lucky in that due to the decline in numbers of animals with BSE he can deduct €70 million from the fund for general disease control measures. This is a good development which is to be welcomed. The Minister should grab the bull by the horns and change the culling policy. There is no scientific basis to our present system of culling the full herd. He will argue that we must protect our markets but it is a measure which is being adopted in other countries. The French food safety authority has recommended this policy and the Danes now cull just the cohorts of the herd. I believe there is room for further savings in this area and I encourage the Minister to follow that path.Agriculture and the food and drinks industry are worth approximately €7 billion per year. I was surprised to learn that An Bord Bia has only one representative working in the United States. This is quite astonishing. Rather than providing direct support to farmers, it might be better for Government to develop an environment conducive to selling the produce. We may have over-emphasised the importance of funding. On-farm developments are very worthwhile but we should develop the concept of funding the producer in selling his products in the market.REPS has been increased by €70 million. This is particularly important in the light of the cross-compliance measures which will be introduced in the next few years with the new mid-term review. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will no doubt speak about the 8% increase in the Estimates. That is not an accurate figure because responsibility for forestry has been transferred into the Department and this has created an increase. I acknowledge it has risen by a figure in  the region of 5% but not 8% as stated by the Minister.

A farm family made a presentation to the committee about early farm retirement and disability. I asked an official to take a record for the Minister of Agriculture and Food. The family were excluded from the early farm retirement scheme because the gentleman suffered from multiple sclerosis and could not farm in the past few years. I am aware of approximately 80 similar cases. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his officials to examine that regulation. He may claim it is an EU regulation but I believe there is a facility within that regulation to cater for such families.It would be remiss of me not to refer to the Punchestown affair. In the Minister for Finance's speech to the House last night he stated that it seems people do not object to its existence but rather its location. My predecessor as spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Dukes, welcomed it and I agree with what he said. I welcome the centre at Punchestown. I welcome its existence and I have no difficulty with its location. Notwithstanding the financial aspect of the centre and the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts which is a separate affair, I believe we sometimes cannot see the wood for the trees. We can become bogged down in issues such as this and lose our perspective on what is important.I regard the levy of €1.5 million imposed by Kildare County Council as a scandal. It highlights the dearth of funding available to local authorities that they are forced to use back door mechanisms to gather funding. I regard the failure of the State and the Department of Education and Science to recognise the problem of dyslexia and to do something about it as a far bigger scandal than Punchestown ever would be.I ask the Minister to outline what he plans to do with the funding of approximately €36 million coming from modulation in the next few years. The Taoiseach should return the responsibility for rural development to the Department of Agriculture and Food. I will never understand why he took it out. On a recent trip abroad I noticed milk vending machines. I have never seen them in Ireland unless they are at the Curragh Camp, something Deputy Power might know. I suggest we replace Coke with a milk shake.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	821	I wish to share my time with Deputy Seán Power. The Estimates have provision for the expenditure of €40 billion by the Exchequer next year, an increase of €1.9 billion or a 5% increase on last year's Estimate. There will also be increases on budget day in social wel fare of approximately 2.3% when inflation is taken into account. This will mean a real increase in expenditure next year of approximately 4%. It is important to recognise that the figure includes borrowing of €3 billion to finance important developments in the areas of health, education, social welfare and infrastructure.Deputy Timmins spoke about agriculture. I am pleased to see a 5% increase in the gross Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food. In addition to this €1.39 billion, the Department is also responsible for the expenditure of a further €1.6 billion on EU-funded agricultural measures paid directly to farmers. This will mean total expenditure by the Department in 2004 of approximately €3 billion. The average payment to each farmer in Ireland is approximately €13,000. There will be a 37% increase in the provision for the rural environment protection programme; 31% increase in the Estimate for forestry; 75% increase in the Estimate for on-farm investment schemes; 58% increase in the Estimate for farm waste management; an increase of 67% on the 2003 figure in the dairy hygiene area which will give a total of €3.5 million; 180% increase on the 2003 figure for the installation aid scheme bringing it up to €9 million in the coming year.I have listened to this debate in the House. Speakers talk about billions of euro and macroeconomics and such like. Unless the Estimates mean something to people on the ground they count for nothing at all. I will list what these Estimates will mean for the people of County Laois.I hope the Minister for Education and Science will have funding to advance to architectural planning stage the new second level schools in Portlaoise and also make a provision if necessary to deal with the emerging situation arising from the potential closure of Ballyfin College secondary school in County Laois. There may be some funding required for planning in the case of the new situation. At national school level I am hoping the Estimates will provide money for improvements to the schools at Camross, Castletown, Rathdowney, Ballyadams, Newtown and Killeshin.Some €33 million has been invested in the new paediatric unit and the upgrading of Portlaoise general hospital. I look forward to the Minister being present for the formal opening of the new unit in the early new year and hope he will provide any additional funding that may be necessary. That programme is on track as a result of the expenditure this year. I hope any requirement in next year's figures will be provided for in the Estimates.I hope and expect that the Estimates figure provided for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will enable sufficient funding for Laois County Council to progress its housebuilding programme in Castletown, The Swan, Graiguecullen and Portlaoise and will provide funding for social housing schemes in Mountrath, Abbeyleix, Durrow,  Rathdowney, Graiguecullen, Portlaoise and Stradbally.Some Members may be slightly surprised but I firmly believe that these Estimates must be translated into benefits for people on the ground, otherwise they are an academic exercise of no relevance to people. I can spend the day in the House talking about percentage increases and billions here and billions there and macroeconomics, but that does not count with the people on the ground. They want to know what affects them in their locality. I am making these Estimates relevant to the people on the ground in County Laois, the people I represent.I hope the Estimates will include sufficient funding to enable the swimming pool projects in Portlaoise and Portarlington to proceed. I look forward to the provision of funding that will allow the advancement of the water and sewerage schemes in Mountrath, Abbeyleix, Durrow, Rathdowney, Castletown, Swan, Timahoe and Ballylinan.The Minister for Transport unveiled a great increase in the Estimates for his Department. The Monasterevin bypass construction project is well under way and the Kildare bypass is due to be opened in the coming weeks, and both will be of tremendous assistance to County Laois, the next county to Kildare as one heads south from Dublin. I hope funding will be made available to advance the road projects between Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory and Portlaoise and Cullahill. I also look forward to resources being made available to decentralise another Department to Portlaoise in 2004.I hope other Deputies will make these Estimates as relevant to their constituents as I have done because that is a TD's job, making what we do relevant to those we represent.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I would like to deal with the attacks on the racing industry, a major contributor to the economy, by the leader of the Labour Party. Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the matter yesterday, asking how the Taoiseach could justify cuts of €58 million that will affect the weakest in society when €67 million will be made available for horse racing, most of it in prize money for the diversion of tax exiles involved in the racing industry. The racing industry puts far more money into the economy than it takes out.In 2001 the Minister for Agriculture and Food  introduced the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill that guaranteed funding to both those racing industries and we have since seen the wonderful effects that had, not just on attendances but on facilities at racetracks. To suggest that most of that money goes in prize money to wealthy owners who are tax exiles is nonsense. The hare is an integral part of the greyhound industry but it is obvious that the "Rabbitte" is out of touch with the horse racing industry.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	827	It is important that his colleagues correct him because it is hard to be an expert in every area.This year the Government provided €63 million to both the horse and greyhound racing industries, with 80% going to horse racing and 20% to greyhound racing. Prize money has increased in recent years, which is necessary and fitting because we are competing with other countries and we must retain Ireland's status as one of the top horse racing countries in the world. Prize money does not go to owners alone – 25% of all prize money is divided between jockeys and trainers, with a smaller percentage going to stable staff.Horse Racing Ireland was established two years ago and has a plan to develop the industry, part of which involves developing facilities. For too long there have been run-down facilities at tracks, not just for punters but for stable staff as well. Anyone familiar with the conditions under which stable staff had to work would realise the necessity of funding for that area. They work in conditions that no industry would tolerate. We should think before being critical of the Minister for providing money.The majority of those involved in horse ownership are in it for fun. Those who stay involved do so for a love of the sport and it is important that we encourage them to stay in horse ownership and persuade others to get involved. Very few owners make money out of horse ownership – the majority of them have huge losses that cannot be written off against tax. Last year there were 5,469 horses in training in Ireland, 1,994 races were run under flat and national hunt rules and 28,259 horses took part. It is obvious that the vast majority of horses never win races – quite a few do not even get to the racetrack.In 1969, when the then Minister for Finance, Charles Haughey, introduced a tax exemption on stallion fees, there was widespread support in the House for the measure. The then Deputies Liam Cosgrave and Brendan Corish agreed with the need for such a measure. It was introduced to develop the industry in Ireland and put it on a par with the rest of the world. People should acknowledge the wonderful success it has been – it is one of the few areas where we can claim to be the world's best.Deputy Rabbitte mentioned tax exiles. I only know one person who is seriously involved in the  horse racing industry who is a tax exile and I salute that person for the wonderful contribution and investment he has made. It has cost him a fortune to be involved to such an extent in the industry and when Deputy Rabbitte is making remarks about such people, he should remember the €5 million donated by a certain person involved in the industry for a business school in memory of the late Deputy Jim Kemmy.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	832	It might be an interesting message to give out to the lone parent who is being hit so badly by the Government, who cannot get on to a detoxification scheme because the crèche has been taken away when a community employment scheme was abandoned because of Government cut-backs, or to a person struggling to get mortgage interest relief to which he or she was entitled in the past, or someone forced into the street because he or she cannot get rent allowance. Those people would be very interested to hear about Deputy Seán Power's concerns about racehorse owners.The Estimates for the Department of Health and Children show the chasm between what the Government promises to do and what it delivers. This pattern has been followed since the current Minister for Health and Children entered office. No additional resources will be made available for the implementation of the Hanly report. The Minister can talk about ten year plans and other matters but if the Hanly report is to be implemented, resources must be provided in the 2004 Estimates. They are not and that raises a question mark over the Government's credibility on the Hanly report.At Question Time, the Minister for Health and Children maintained that he would not be closing accident and emergency departments in four local hospitals in the pilot areas – St. Columcille's Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital in Nenagh, Ennis General Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital – that somehow they would remain magically untouched.That is the implication of what he said, but the clear stated object of the Hanly report is to close  these departments. He said that approximately 70% of people presenting at accident and emergency departments were not urgent cases. There is no such figure in the report. There is a figure of 60%, but many people within that 60% who attend a nurse-led minor injuries unit would not be dealt with. What is being proposed in the Hanly report, therefore, would not provide for that need. That needs to be corrected in terms of the flimflam for which the Minister for Health and Children has been responsible.It is worth noting yet again that 169 days remain for the Government, and the Minister in particular, to live up to their commitment that hospital waiting lists will be abolished. There has been no significant change in the number of people on hospital waiting lists and, sadly, we do not even know the true number. We only know those who have gone through the system, seen a specialist and are now waiting to get a hospital bed. The thousands of people waiting to see a specialist are unrecorded. They are the silent numbers of public patients who are required to wait in a way that would be considered unacceptable by any private patient. Any of us covered by VHI or BUPA would find it unacceptable to be put in that situation, and that highlights the true nature of our two-tier system.Even allowing for the solution the Government has presented in the national treatment purchase fund, which has been trumpeted as a great success and has provided for procedures, the means for doing so are open to question. It is certainly not a solution to the problem but it has been effective in providing a certain amount of care and procedures. That fund, however, will receive only a 3% increase. That is interesting because the waiting list initiative will receive no increase as far as one can read.It is impossible to know specifics about many of the allocations in the budget. Up to €7 billion is recorded in a type of lump allocation to health boards and it is impossible to know where that money goes, but it appears that the waiting list initiative will not receive an increase next year. Does this mean the Minister has given up the ghost on public hospital waiting lists? He does not care and is not dealing with it in a focused way.We need to deal specifically with the issue of bed capacity because there was a commitment in the health strategy to provide 3,000 new beds. When the Minister for Finance launched the Fianna Fáil economic manifesto before the previous general election, he promised to spend an additional €1.2 billion in 2004 on that spent in 2002. On capital funding alone he clearly has not done that. This year, the voted capital spending on hospitals will be cut by 8%. He provided only €1.5 million in the two years 2002 to 2004 which is a thousandth of what he promised in his manifesto. We are seeing a cut in capital expenditure at a time when, especially if the Hanly report is implemented, there will be an increased demand for hospital beds which cost money. They cannot  be magicked out of the air. They need to be written into the Estimates as a specific allocation.In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled I noted that, out of the 709 beds promised in January 2002, 568 new beds were provided in the system, but concurrent with that was the closure of 260 beds within the existing hospital complement. Regardless of the reasons for that – financial, refurbishment or whatever – these are decommissioned beds which cut in half the number of new beds promised. This again highlights the issue around the new development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. Between €1 million and €5 million would open that new unit and provide a state of the art accident and emergency department, yet it appears we will not see that.What we are promised in the Estimates, and it appears the Government will deliver on it, is more chaos in our hospital service over the next 12 months, more demand in our accident and emergency departments and more people on trolleys or sitting in chairs waiting to access beds. There is no indication in the Estimates that any of that pain and suffering will be ameliorated over the next 12 months. A 6% increase simply means that the hospitals, if they are fortunate enough, which is doubtful, will be standing still in terms of the experience they have had and it will probably mean that the problem will worsen significantly. Medical inflation is much higher than normal inflation because demands in terms of replacement and maintenance in hospitals are high, yet we are not seeing that being built into the hospital budgets. The 6% is for voluntary hospitals.The most scandalous aspect of these Estimates, and it is the mark that will be imprinted on the Government when it presents itself to the electorate in the next general election, is the failure to increase the number of medical card holders. In a time of continuing prosperity and following a period of a decade during which the country did extremely well, we are now in a situation where the number of people on medical cards is at 27.7%, the lowest proportion since the institution of the scheme in 1972. At a time when we could be caring for vulnerable families, we keep them out of the safety net. We do not provide them with the supports to which they are entitled. The income limits are disgracefully low and what we see, and we all know this, is the unmet demand where people with young children cannot afford to see their general practitioner.What happens in many of these cases? They end up in an accident and emergency department because the primary care service to which the Minister keeps referring – he seems to think it is all about GP co-operatives – simply does not exist for these people. More than anything else that is the true neglect in these Estimates – the neglect of young families on low incomes who cannot afford to attend their general practitioner. It is the one aspect that is so scandalous it will not go unrecorded.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I welcome the opportunity to speak on these Estimates which will involve the expenditure of more than €40 billion in 2004. This represents an increase of 5% in respect of the expenditure and 2% on capital.I recognise that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, when preparing these Estimates, looked at the current situation where we have seen growth figures go from 10.2% in 2000 to 3.8% in 2001, 0.1% in 2002 and 1.5% in 2003. He recognises, as we all do, that when growth is low, so also is revenue and, if the revenue is not available, it cannot be spent. The Government has tried to consolidate the growth we have seen in the economy which has grown by more than half the rate that prevailed in 1997. We are trying to consolidate the gains we have made in the past six and a half years and therefore see growth and revenue increase in years to come. That will leave our economy in a healthy shape.I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for managing the finances in such a way. We have heard much public debate on election promises and Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats getting back into Government last year. The Taoiseach and the Minister stated at the time that growth in the economy was slowing down. In fact, it had already happened by the time the election was called and therefore was no surprise to anyone.However, people recognised that the Government represented a safe pair of hands. This is the Government that brought the economy back to order after the massive mismanagement by other Governments. People wanted a safe pair of hands to manage them through this period of low growth when there was no money to be spent.This is a time when we have to focus on the areas most important to people and those of greatest need. The Minister has correctly identified that the areas on which to focus are health, education, social welfare and investment in our infrastructure, which is necessary to develop the economy.We are also investing in people. Some €1.1 billion of this money will be spent on public service pay. While many people on both sides of the House have said we should spend more, we disagree because we want to keep our borrowings down to enable the economy to remain stable and to benefit in the future. Other people believe that rather than spending €1.1 billion on public service pay, we should not honour the benchmarking payments. That is extraordinary. We value people. As one of my colleagues said earlier, we can talk about figures as much as we like, but the Estimates are about people and the benefits to them. We value people, such as nurses, teachers and gardaí, who will produce the growth to enable us to move forward. They and the Government have signed up to benchmarking. Unlike other parties which feel we should not honour those commitments, we will honour them.I welcome the provision of more than €10 billion for the health service. That represents a  huge increase since 1997 and it means a lot, particularly in my constituency. More than €50 million has been spent on capital investment in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar. There have also been significant improvements in the health service in that county. I have heard people criticise the health service in recent years, despite the fact we have increased spending by €6.55 billion since 1997. We have also increased the number of people working in the health service to 96,000. There have been significant improvements throughout the country.Deputy McManus referred to the Hanly report, which is funded through the Estimates. The Government has been trying through the various reports to improve our health service because we recognise that it needs to be updated and that problems must be tackled. However, all I hear is criticism of the Government's proposals. No one has suggested an alternative. Deputy McManus is a case in point and I am sorry she is not still in the House. Two years ago the Labour Party launched its health document, which Deputy Howlin said at the time was the most wonderfully researched document the Labour Party had published. However, it was dead and buried within a week and we have not heard a word about it since.The Government is committed to spending the money where it feels it is needed and the Minister has correctly identified that. I want this economy to grow from strength to strength so that we are not crippled by an overburdened debt and that we will have money to invest in our people and infrastructure in the future. As regards the ESRI's views on spending, will the Minister ensure that all the money allocated for the regional operational programme is spent? I want the money to be spent in the BMW region. We must get our fair share, particularly for road and rail infrastructure. I am anxious that that is maintained in the years to come.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	834	When the Book of Estimates or the budget is presented, most commentators would urge the Minister to be prudent. I do so today because we want to ensure that we stay in line with other economies and that we have the time and the money to develop this country and to support businesses as we move into new and challenging times. We will reflect on the detail when the budget is announced in a couple of weeks.The mark of any civilised society is how it looks after its weak or less well off members. We must continue to focus on that in the context of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and what is included not only in the Book of Estimates but also in the budget. We must continue to give the type of increases we gave over the years to those who are less well off to enable them to have a good quality of life.Small businesses have been served well by county enterprise boards. New businesses have  been formed and funding has been provided. However, funding to county enterprise boards has been reduced in recent years because of the growth in the economy. However, given that the economy has changed, we must encourage local indigenous businesses to create jobs in their local communities by refocusing on the activities of county enterprise boards and giving them better financial support.As regards the roads programme, it is good that it is being rolled out and that money is being provided. However, some projects, such as the Kilkenny ring-road which has not yet been completed, have been on the State's books for the past 20 years. I ask the Minister to match the spend on the Kilkenny ring-road with the €30 million spent on the river, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, must be commended. The roads infrastructure in Kilkenny must be dealt with if the economy is to grow. I will not be satisfied until work is done on that this year. Perhaps there is a need for us to reflect on the type of roads we are building. Perhaps we are going too far in terms of the design and roll-out.As regards public accounts, I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and every week we see significant sums of money being overspent on schemes, such as roads or information technology, throughout the country. I encourage the Government to reward Departments which spend within their budgets and which are innovative with the money provided. The unspent money should be given back to them to spend on the customer services required. If we focused on managing the money, rather than on what we want to spend, we would have a better economy. Large sums of money are being overspent or duplicated in different areas. County councils, for example, spend enormous amounts of money on consultants. There is no reason that could not be done in a Department as projects are rolled out. Consultancy groups could be represented and their views taken on board. If we did that, we would save a considerable amount of money. Private consultancies are making a lot of money because they are doing the same thing for every county council.There is a need to reform the public service and to attract professionals into it to ensure greater management and efficiency of spend and value for the money we allocate to the different Departments. If that was done, there would be larger amounts of money for communities. A small amount of money would do a lot for many of the communities we represent. I am talking about management, efficiency and value for money, which have been largely ignored in recent years. We must address this area because my experience on the Committee of Public Accounts demands that something must be done as soon as possible.

Once again, Sinn Féin calls for the budget and the cuts to be equality and poverty-proofed in a transparent process. Equality proofing and spending benefit the majority on the island. More than 50% of the population are women and almost 10% live with a disability. When one takes into account the effect on their family members, they represent almost one third of the population. Irish society is also ethnically diverse and there is a need to challenge racism. We are not doing enough in that regard. Another group in our society which would benefit from equality proofing is the aged who are at risk of age-related discrimination. Equality spending is an investment in a better society and future for each person on the island.Last year the Government made cuts across the equality sector, despite ongoing discrimination and the pressing need for equality measures. Some of them were very deep. There were cutbacks in spending on the Equality Authority and the equality tribunal, and equality monitoring was cut by 48%. Measures relating to people with disabilities were cut by 44% and funding for the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism was also cut. The anti-racism awareness campaign was slashed by 63%.For 2004 the Government proposes to rub salt into these wounds. Equality monitoring will be cut by an additional 18%. Funding to improve the status of people with disabilities will be cut by 19%. The anti-racism awareness campaign will be cut by 76%. Contrary to what the Minister claimed, these cuts bear no relation to organisational ineffectiveness, proven waste or the reduction of need. They are just another front in the mean-spirited war against a rights-based society being waged by the Government, especially the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.These cuts are unconscionable at a time when the Government proposes to increase spending to more than €66 million on underwriting the leisure pursuits of the wealthy in the form of the horse and greyhound racing fund. It also intends to spend more than €700,000 on a secret service which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claims does not exist. At a minimum, the 2003 cuts to the equality sector should be reversed and full funding reinstated in this year's budget.It is unacceptable that the Government has not decided to take advantage of the occasion of the EU Presidency in 2004 to show leadership on the issue of reaching the UN overseas development target of 0.7% of GNP. Instead the Government has, for the third year in a row, frozen this spending at 0.41%, against the advice of Development Co-operation Ireland and Dóchas. If we are to reach the target as promised by the Taoiseach we will need a multi-annual commitment to  incremental increases, beginning with an increase to 0.48% this year. Anything less is inexcusable.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	838	A perusal of the Book of Estimates by a representative from the west does not make for relaxing reading. Although this country needs to become more competitive, the west needs to make leaps and bounds into the new millennium before we can even discuss competitiveness. In a nutshell, the west is years behind the east in the provision of infrastructure. There is nothing in the Book of Estimates to indicate this will change in a significant way in the immediate future. The continued neglect of the west by successive Governments will continue.In the west we lack infrastructure, decent roads linking us to the east, north and south, a rail service linking the entire western region and water and sewerage schemes in our towns and villages, where no growth has occurred for generations. People are now willing to invest in houses, where there is a large demand, but planning permission is being refused because the water and sewerage schemes in some towns are not adequate to cater for an increased load. In other cases they do not exist at all. We look to the Estimates to see the good news of an increase in the provision for sewerage but all we find is a 7% reduction.In the few centres in the west with half-decent sewerage facilities we do not have the road network to facilitate access for industrialists who may be willing, with a push, to channel inward investment. We look at the Book of Estimates to see the percentage increase included for road construction in the west – again, there is great disappointment. After the last election the Government was shocked at the results in the west. Its remedy was to appoint a Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which was a great idea in theory. However, ideas based on knee-jerk reactions, when not properly resourced, result in failure. I fully supported the setting up of this Department and the appointment of Deputy Ó Cuív as Minister because I know his commitment to the west. Unfortunately, however, the Minister and his Department have been too starved of funding to make an impression on the problems of the west.The Minister for Finance said in his speech last night: "In assessing our economic prospects and framing our spending policies we must, therefore, deal with the world as it is."  I agree thoroughly. The world for the people of the west is one of neglect, of being on the hind tit, of getting the crumbs from the table of the eastern masters, of begging from the Government, of being fobbed off. The Minister also said last night: "Ireland's position as a small and open economy means that economic developments here are, to a large degree, determined by our ability to supply goods and services to the global economy."  If this is applied to the west, the ability to supply goods and services is hamstrung because of the diabolical infrastructure in the area. It is time for Government to acknowledge the difficulties faced  by those in the west and set about rectifying them.

This year we are seeing further cuts in the Estimates. Last year, in my first year as a TD, we had cuts. and I remember getting into a spat with Deputy Ring over the question of TDs taking a pay cut in line with the cuts that would affect the most underprivileged members of society. I have much respect for Deputy Ring, but we argued over that. Later in the year Deputy Fiona O'Malley called for something similar.I reiterate, not in a spurious way, that some TDs are seen, aided by certain well-off media figures, to be taking long holidays, to be working in the Dáil only for short periods and to be making lots of money at the expense of those who are most vulnerable in our society, who have been hit once again in these Estimates and will no doubt be hit again when the budget comes out – for example, those who suffer from coeliac disease. The trouble with this disease is that one must pay for special food which is very expensive. A person on social welfare who finds the dietary allowance is being phased out will be hit hard. It will not hit TDs, who will shortly receive another pay increase. The Minister for Finance should put forward a proposal to freeze TDs' pay in line with proper Dáil reform. Deputy Boyle pointed this out recently in our submission on Dáil reform, as have members of other Opposition parties.Last year I was castigated about the subsidies in this House. Dublin TDs are paid more than €61 per day just for turning up. Who is watching? Who says one is turning up? One can just walk in and walk out without anybody knowing. Unless we tighten up our procedures within this House and are seen to be setting an example, this urination on the less well-off in society will cause long-term damage.

The Estimates must be considered in terms of how the economy is performing and our ability to spend and raise money. It has often been said that we should spend more on one thing or another – on this side of the House one must listen to it every day. Extra money should be spent on every project that is put forward. Every one of those is worthy in its own way but the amount of resources is finite. While the option of raising borrowings or additional taxation certainly exists, the danger with this is it makes the economy less competitive. The Minister for Finance has managed to maintain Ireland's position in a difficult and challenging global economic climate. We have only to look at what is happening in neighbouring European states and consider the rates of unemployment there. We have managed to sustain historically high levels of employment. I looked at the Minister's budget speech of last year and while he said he expected unemployment to rise to 5% or 5.25%, the outturn is more like 4.5%. A little over a year ago, Opposition Members clamoured to ask what would be done about the rate of inflation, then running at 4% or 5%. The rate of inflation is now 2.3%. Managing the economy on the macro level is crucially important.Like Deputy Gogarty and others, I am concerned about disadvantaged people as I represent areas that are socially excluded. I grew up with people in those areas. Employment is the best approach to tackling disadvantage and social exclusion.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I thank Deputy Curran for sharing time with me. When talking about an increase in this year's Estimates of approximately 5%, one must remember that while we can have political debates about the extent of increases and where the priority of increases should lie, such increases, when looked at from a base level in 1997, are enormous. One cannot compare a 5% increase in 2002 with a 5% increase in 1997 as we were coming from historically low levels of public expenditure. A 5.9% increase now – twice the level of inflation and twice that of any other economy in the EU – is coming from a high base. A 5% increase now represents €1.9 billion in additional expenditure. If spending had been increased by €1.9 billion in 1997, it would have been a 27% increase in overall expenditure. Increases must be looked at in this context. I will engage with anybody about the nature of the increases and the priorities regarding different Departments.A close connection has developed in recent years between the Estimates process and the  budget. Prior to this, people used to think these were entirely separate processes. I congratulate the Minister for Finance on drawing this connection to people's notice and putting the myth to bed. While the connection between income in the Estimates and spending in the budget was always recognised in economic circles, Members of this House and across the political divide have only belatedly converted to the notion. The Government cannot spend more than it is earning through taxes.I was in school in the 1980s when more than half of my class had to leave Ireland because we were spending far beyond what we were receiving in revenue. I am not afraid to say this was a fault of Fianna Fáil Governments, indeed the Minister for Finance made this criticism in the early 1980s. However, this spending was primarily propagated throughout the 1980s by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition. That had to stop. Having been in Government for 13 of the past 16 years, Fianna Fáil has drawn a line under that and we simply cannot go back to those days.Whereas before the Estimates were prepared in the context of internal economic factors, there is a growing realisation that many international economic factors have a greater impact on current Estimates than at any other time in our history. Limerick and the mid-west have the country's highest level of foreign direct investment and one of the highest levels in the entire European Union. If we do not take into account the international factors that we are only now beginning to realise, such levels of investment will depart for other shores. They depend on stable Government finances, a low cost base, low labour costs and free availability of labour. If we depart from the prudent financial measures and fiscal management of the economy which we have adopted in the past 13 years and adopt the policies which everyone on the other side of the House invites us to adopt, we will go back to the years when half my class departed these shores.I congratulate the Government and the Minister for adopting prudent economic and fiscal policies when they are badly needed.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I wish to share my time with Deputy Pat Breen.The recently unveiled education Estimates are a textbook example of how to convert an increase in education spending into a reduction in the education service. The Minister will say his overall allocation has increased, but these Estimates show a shortfall of almost €20 million in current spending. The increase in 2004 is estimated to be just over €600 million. If we deduct from this the increases in pay for 2004, which equal €477 million, and the increase in the allocation to the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the child abuse commission of €125 million, we see that, despite Deputy Curran's reading of the Estimates, the increases consume more than the total increase allocated by the Estimates to current expenditure for 2004.The recently published Estimates show that the Minister for Education and Science will not even spend the budget allocated to him in 2003 for capital projects. An astounding amount, just over €60 million, has been left unspent this year, despite teachers and students working in appalling conditions. The Department of Education and Science has failed to utilise the resources allocated to it to make capital investments in school buildings and facilities.The Minister will champion the increase in allocation to primary schools building projects for 2004, which I acknowledge, but will fail to mention that this increase is less than half the amount left unspent by his Department in capital projects for 2003. He has repeatedly said he can only spend what he has, but the Estimates show that he cannot even do that.If the Minister continues to contend that education spending will have increased for 2004, we must state the areas on which he is not spending. Building grants for second level schools have increased by 1%, well below the rate of inflation. The National Educational Psychological Service receives another paltry increase of 1%, also less than the rate of inflation. There will be no increased spending on building grants or capital costs at the institutes of technology, universities or centres for young offenders. The measly increase of only 1% in second level schools building projects means that these projects still have fewer resources than they had in 2002.Deputy Fleming outlined his wish list for County Laois. We all share his wishes but the people in Portlaoise, Ballyfin, Camross , Castletown, Ballyadams, Newtown and Killeshin to whom he referred did not elect him to hope. They elected him in the hope that he would deliver something. The figures as outlined for this year give little hope of that.It must also be remembered that the Minister committed himself to funding proper science facilities at all second level schools in 2004. The provision of these new facilities is all the more important given the statistics that I recently uncovered showing a serious slump in the numbers studying the life and physical sciences at third level. Science student numbers at third level have plummeted by 6,000 since the Government came to office. Given the tiny increase in funding, which is far below the rate of inflation, how can science facilities be brought up to an acceptable standard in second level schools? I greatly fear that the sharp decline in interest in science will continue unchallenged with serious consequences for our economy. Chemical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies may well look elsewhere for a more scientifically educated workforce.The increase of 1% in funding to the National Educational Psychological Service means that the NEPS will not be able to expand. Already, huge areas within Ireland are not covered by the service. Some 71% of schools in the mid-west, 57%  in the north-west and 44% in the midlands are not covered. Children already wait up to two years for an assessment. Less money means more waiting.The recent report from the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that the Department of Education and Science has, in the past 18 months, spent more than €2 million funding private psychological assessments because its own service has not been rolled out efficiently and comprehensively. This leaves the Minister open to the charge of poor management. His Department spends €2 million on private assessments but only allocates an additional €115,000 to the NEPS. This does not make sense. If there is no psychological service in an area, it is right that the Department should fund a private assessment, but it would make more economic sense to fund the NEPS properly. We must remember the role of the NEPS under the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. With these limited resources I do not know how it will meet that challenge.A year and a half after its establishment, the National Educational Welfare Board is nowhere near meeting its targets. The board has a statutory obligation given it by the House to tackle non-attendance at schools and challenge and monitor disadvantage. Without funding, this cannot be done. Last February, in a letter to all schools, the NEWB confirmed that it could not provide assistance in schools where officers have not been appointed. Gardaí no longer have a role in this area. Given the allocation in the Estimates, the NEWB will still be unable to provide a service to schools outside a small number of urban areas.One must wonder if the Minister has any idea of what work takes place in Ireland's third level institutes and universities. These colleges have been through a time of uncertainty and confusion. I attended a conference organised by the NUI. For the third level sector, these Estimates are another blow, showing a reduction of 47% in building grants and capital costs at the institutes of technology and 45% in the case of the universities. How does this square with the commitment in the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrat programme for Government to support advanced research and the physical renewal of third level campuses?The Estimates will also come as a blow to those involved in youth work nationally. The small increases in funding flagged in the Estimates are far below what youth work organisations were hoping for and fail to recognise the huge benefits that can be derived from youth work programmes. The Estimates show yet another missed opportunity to promote youth work.These Estimates are a triumph of appearance over reality, but reality bites and the bite will be felt in many homes.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	866	Spending cuts have dominated the Government's programme since taking power in June 2002. Last year spending cuts were made  before the budget and all Government promises were abandoned. We remember the slogan, "A lot done. More to do". The Minister has lived up to his promise and has done a lot of people once again.The public continues to pay dearly for the pre-election spending spree and for the collapse in prudent spending controls. Current spending provision is 58% more than in 2000. Once again, our health services have been targeted. The drugs payment scheme has been targeted with an increase of €8 per month which places the threshold at €78. This will add to the burden of chronically ill people, adding nearly €100 per year to their medical bills. We were promised 200,000 extra medical cards. Given that Ireland has the highest level of respiratory ailments in Europe, I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to ask the Minister for Finance to consider giving medical cards to the many asthma sufferers throughout the country who have been ignored by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government during the past six years.We have seen other silent increases in hospital bed charges and accident and emergency charges. If the Minister for Health and Children gets his way, the people of Clare will be exempt from accident and emergency charges because we will not have an accident and emergency service. The 15,000 people who marched in Ennis last Saturday will not accept his proposals and will send a clear message to the Government at the local and European elections.As Fine Gael junior spokesperson on transport and wearing my constituency shirt, I congratulate the Minister for Transport on his commitment to begin construction of the Ennis bypass in 2004. This was achieved by intense lobbying by Government and Opposition Members and by the county council. I welcome this commitment, although it is two years behind schedule and we have lost much business because of the delay. The bypass will be a tremendous help to the west, especially Shannon Airport. Eleven other road projects, including Monaghan, Castleblayney, Mullingar and Cavan, are not included this year because there has been no increase in funding. I sympathise with these communities.The Government has made no commitment to the railways or the western rail link, despite the fact that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs fully supports the West on Track campaign. This is a pity. With the upgrading of the line, we now have a good service from Ennis to Limerick. My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, would be delighted if the Ennis to Athenry line could be upgraded in the next few years. I urge the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to appeal to the Minister for Finance on this matter.Last year saw the passing of the Railway Safety Bill, yet this year the Minister for Transport proposes to cut funding by 23%. How can he say safety is his priority? Let us consider local authorities, which have been hit badly by the Minister's refusal to grant extra moneys to fund  benchmarking and the recommendations of Sustaining Progress. Most local authorities are under financial pressure and they have to paddle their own canoes. As a result of the Government's policy, local authorities will have to impose higher rates for businesses and young couples will have to pay up to €9,000 for planning permission. It was only in last year's budget that the first-time buyer's grant was abolished by the Government.Other charges have been imposed which I do not have time to address. The extra gardaí that were promised and the 7% drop in respect of sewerage schemes have also to be considered. This latter drop will delay the development of certain sewerage schemes for another year or two, and this will be a hindrance to local communities. People will continue to get poorer under the policies of this Government.

I 1997 bhí €5.7 billiúin caite ar leasa shóisialaigh. Roimh an gcáinaisnéis beidh €10.6 billiúin caite ag an Rialtas agus ardófar é sin sa gcáinaisnéis. Tá caiteachas sláinte imithe ó chaiteachais de €3.6 bhilliúin i 1997 go os cionn €10 mbilliúin i 2004 agus caiteachas ar oideachas imithe ó €3.2 bhilliúin go €6.5 bhilliúin i rith an thréimhse céanna. Cruthaíonn sé seo go bhfuil tosaíochtaí soiléir ag an Rialtas agus go bhfuil i gceist aige seasamh leo.I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Estimates and to make a few brief comments on them. It is amazing how, within one year, the agenda keeps moving as we in Government solve problems. Last year we were told that the big issue was the rate of inflation. Now that it is less than half of that of one year ago, at 2.3%, this issue has disappeared from the radar screen.

When I was in Salsburg last week I spoke to people from other countries and noted that they are quite amazed that we have managed to maintain this level.On the Estimates, before budget day adjustments, the increase in spending is already twice the rate of inflation and amounts to €40 billion. Of this, 67% will be spent on health, education and social welfare, thus outlining clearly the Government's commitment to these three very important expenditure areas.It is important to note that there have been massive increases in expenditure, even allowing for inflation, since 1997 in expenditure in these three Departments. Social welfare expenditure has increased from €5.7 billion to €10.6 billion before the Estimates, while health expenditure has trebled from €3.6 billion to over €10 billion in the same period. Education expenditure has increased from €3.2 billion to €6.5 billion.Let us consider the Estimates pertaining to my own Department. The expenditure for my Department represents a 5% increase on the Revised Estimates Volume for 2003. Included is a funding increase of 5% for community affairs, 18% for islands – this is the greatest amount ever spent on the islands – and a 5% increase for the drugs programme.I am delighted that a new subhead called RAPID has been introduced into the Estimates for my Department. A provision of €5.8 million has been provided for it. I have consistently said in the past year that it was my intention to have a radical overhaul of the RAPID programme in place by the 1 January 2004.

I always stick by the dates I give and they are always realistic. The main element of this process is a separation of the major items identified in the area action plans of each area action team from the minor items that should be dealt with at local level. A dedicated capital fund of €4.5 million is now provided for in the Estimates to ensure that the area action teams, in consultation with the other statutory agencies, can deal with local issues at a local level. This money will be used as leverage money similar to the way that the CLÁR programme operates and it will fast-track many of the small issues that require resolution on the ground. In addition to the money ring-fenced in the plan for the disbursement of the dormant accounts for RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas, amounting to €15 million in 2004, significant progress will be made in RAPID areas in tackling social inclusion in the coming years.It is important to put these figures in context. The sum of €15 million and the €4.5 million, which, based on the experience of CLÁR, should lever out about €6 million or €7 million, amount to well over €20 million in direct new spend within the CLÁR areas and the RAPID areas in  particular. This will break down the logjam that has been created. One of the weaknesses of the RAPID programme as it existed was that there were about 1,000 actions Departments had to deal with, some of which were very small, such as the necessity for ramps in housing estates. However, central government should not have to make decisions on such issues. It is much better to localise the decisions in this regard through the local fund. This would allow us to deal, on an interdepartmental basis, with the bigger issues that need to be dealt with at the top level of Government. I am very confident this new approach will make a significant difference on the ground to the people in the RAPID areas next year.The Estimates for my Department provide for a doubling of the funding for the western investment fund from €2 million in 2003 to €4 million in 2004. I made a commitment at the time of the publication of the Estimates last year that my Department would continue to monitor the performance of this fund. I am delighted I have been able to facilitate the fund with a full programme of work this year and I am confident that the €4 million provided in next year's will be adequate to meet all demands on the fund in 2004.Tá áthas orm go bhfuil airgead ar fáil sna Meastacháin le hOifig Coimisinéir Teanga a bhunú.

From my days as a co-operative manager, I have been constantly critical of Údarás na Gaeltachta, particularly the manner in which it funded building projects for community groups and local entrepreneurs. For the State to do the building work when it has no use for the assets in terms of collateral, rather than giving assistance to build, was wasteful of public resources and denied community groups the collateral they so badly needed to allow them to raise working capital finances from the banks.In discussing the Estimates, it is important we have a rational, mature debate. While we all agree in private that changes are needed, sometimes when we stand up in public, we allow the cheap political shot to cloud the more rational debate needed to ensure we obtain full value for the public money we spend.Mr. Connaughton: I wish to share time with Deputy Kehoe.

The Government sent down the relevant direction and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the  Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, are now running for cover. While I do not have time to debate the issue with the Minister now, we will discuss it again in wide open spaces.The Minister cannot deny that the Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant of £3,000 and increased VAT on building by 1%, which was nothing compared to the damage it has done by not financing local authorities. The Government's financing system for local government has led directly to people in County Galway paying an additional €15,000 for a house, instead of receiving a grant of £3,000. Moreover, in the Estimates, it has withdrawn the rent subsidy from many of those who have a roof over their heads and are renting. I cannot understand the reason a Government which is supposed to be in touch with the people has decided to steamroll over the very people least able to look after themselves.What happened to the decentralisation programme?

Their relocation costs money. One cannot expect to be able to set up a Department in a rural or provincial town at no cost. In other words, no decentralisation will take place in 2004, although we will hear of the issue again when promises of decentralisation are made before the county council elections next June. This is another major commitment on which the Government has reneged since the general election.What happened to youth services? I have often heard the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is present, and several of his colleagues talk about such services. This is supposed to be a nation which takes pride in its youth and the way in which we try to help out our young people. No funding has been provided in the Estimates which leaves all of the youth organisations, the 40,000 volunteers, on the side of the road. We should not cod ourselves that this is good government.Like many of my colleagues, I cannot understand the reason the Government expects the people of the Ballinasloe area of County Galway, for instance, to accept the Hanly report in any circumstances, given that it will obviously result in a worse level of service. How can anyone expect any section of the population to buy a pig in a bag? The basis of the Hanly report is hospitals of excellence but we will not have them until our local hospitals have been downgraded. As far as I and the Minister's party colleagues in my constituency are concerned, we will not, under any circumstances, allow Portiuncula Hospital, to use the words of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to be sacrificed on the altar of Hanly.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	881	I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, said. The Book of Estimates is a scandal which should be ripped up and put in the bin of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith. In a five minute speech to the House this morning he did not mention his Department once – other Deputies also remarked on this omission – because he was so ashamed of the cuts the Estimates imposed on it.Earlier, we had the three tenors, Deputies Fleming, Cassidy and Johnny Brady, on the Government back benches rebutting everything said on this side of the House. I assume the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance told them at the Fianna Fáil Party parliamentary party meeting to go into the Chamber and do this. They were not able to stand up for the cuts which every Minister must impose on his or her Department.I do not know how I will explain the cuts to the less well-off in my constituency. How will I explain to lone parents, coeliacs and those who are unemployed, disabled or homeless that the disabled person's grant, the essential repairs for the elderly grant, rent allowance, respite care grants, nursing home subvention and the schools building programme have been cut? How will I explain that the number of medical cards is limited or the position regarding the Wexford bypass and St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy? The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, informed the House that a new unit for elderly people would be built at the hospital. I became worried when I saw its position on the list. The unit will be built some time in the future. Reading through old newspaper cuttings today, I discovered it was first promised in 1982. We are now in 2003 and the project team is still sitting around a table. Will the Minister for Health and Children or his Minister of State tell me the position of the project on the list?The Minister for Transport did not once mention County Wexford. Three towns in the county, Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross, are waiting for a bypass. I do not know whether it has been decided to construct a tunnel or bypass to cross the river at New Ross. In Gorey, traffic is backed up for up to an hour and a half every day from Wednesday to Sunday. It is a scandal. Other backbenchers tell the House that various bypasses are going ahead but the Gorey bypass has been shelved.This Government looks after the rich. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, makes his Budget Statement he will tell us what he will give to the less well-off but what he gives with one hand, he will take back with the other through stealth taxes. Look at refuse collection charges, development charges and the increases in charges for accident and emergency services, the drugs refund scheme, the television licence and car tax. Deputy Connaughton spoke about the abolition of the first-time buyer's  grant. After that, VAT charges were increased and now development charges are being imposed.This Government looks after the rich, not the poor. Of course, the poor will not be going to the Galway races or paying up to €300 per plate for dinner in the tent. The rich people will do it. The Government will look after the rich because it will get the money back from them at the Galway races. Every party has to do its share of fundraising but it should not be done by looking after the rich and telling the poor that since they cannot give any money, they will not be given anything in return.This Government has always claimed to look after the poor. However, as Deputy Ring pointed out this morning, it takes better care of animals than people. That is certainly true when one sees what happened at Punchestown and what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, did for his horsey friends in Kildare. Deputy Stagg had a major row with him about it and I agree with Deputy Stagg. Deputy McCreevy has looked after his friends and partners over the last few years and we are fed up with it.I cannot recommend these Estimates to the House. They should be torn up. A Fine Gael-led Government would do a far better job than the present Government. The Minister present, Deputy Dermot Ahern, takes every chance to criticise but given the amount of money and the good times this Government has enjoyed, can the Minister point to anything that it has improved? The Luas is on the road to nowhere. I agree with everything said by the Opposition Members in this debate. Hopefully, the Minister and the Government parties will see the light when the House votes at 7 p.m.

The Government has rejected calls from the Opposition for massive increases across every budgetary subhead, without saying where the money will be found. It has rejected the short-termism adopted by Opposition Deputies which cost the country so dear in the past. We cannot and will not risk the increases in taxation and borrowing which ruined this country in the 1980s. To take the wrong decisions now means putting people on the dole queues. It is that simple.In these Estimates, and in the forthcoming budget, we set the strategic tone for the next few years. We will ensure that this economy does not go the way of other tiger economies. We will not allow bust to follow boom. The Estimates provide €457 million for my Department. This allocation will provide for a wide range of services. The budget for marine services is up 119% since 1997, the budget for fishery harbours is up 527% since 1997 and the budget for marine research is up 109%.In the telecommunications sector, the Department will spend €32.5 million rolling out the metropolitan area broadband network. Deputy Kehoe will welcome that, given that it will go to his constituents. He will probably be there to cut the tape or to welcome the Fianna Fáil Minister when he cuts it.

A sum of €30.48 million is provided in the Estimates for critical marine safety services. This is in keeping with my strong commitment to delivery in this priority area. Almost €26 million is being provided for the Irish Coast Guard. This includes over €20 million to meet the contracted cost of marine search and rescue helicopter provision at Shannon, Dublin and Waterford. Years ago we relied on the UK for these services. Now the UK relies on us for cover as a result of the huge investment made in this area since 1997.Over €28.5 million is being provided next year for fishery harbour and sea port infrastructure, coastal protection, foreshore development and marine and natural resources tourism initiatives. The €22 million allocation in respect of fishery harbour development in 2004 will provide €10 million for the completion of the new harbour development at Killybegs. This €50 million development is strategically significant for the Irish fishing sector not only in Killybegs but in the north-west region and will underpin economic activity in the seafood sector. It will allow a considerable amount to be made available to commence other priority fishery harbour infrastructure developments in 2004. The Estimates underpin my commitment to regional development both in the area of technology and  communications and in the seafood and fisheries sector.In a difficult public finances climate, my objectives are clear. I will commit and deploy available resources to programmes which will continue to contribute to economic competitiveness, sustainability and social and regional balance. This Government's agenda is clear. We want to hold onto the gains made, continue the policies which have served us well, keep public spending increases in line with the increases in resources and keep debt and taxation low. In times of economic downturn our message is clear – what we have, we hold. Although times are tough we have a great deal.On Friday, the OECD released its latest unemployment statistics. They show that for the euro area, the standardised unemployment rate stands at 8.8%. In the US, it is 6.1%; in France it is 9.5%; in Germany it is 9.4%; and in Ireland it is 4.5%. The challenge now is to think strategically and to maintain prosperity. We must invest in areas which will drive further growth and development. This is not the time to support policies of punitive taxation, massive borrowing and permanent deficits.However, these are the concomitants of the policies advanced by the Opposition. It pays lip-service to the notion that spending must be curtailed while at the same time criticises every attempt by the Government to stabilise spending. This is the shallow double-think which plunged this country into depression in the 1980s and which guides Opposition policy today. It would make this country an economic basket case again, as it was in the early 1980s. Putting this Opposition into Government is akin to putting a duck in a desert. It does not work.I am not sure if the Opposition Members are familiar with the BBC series, "The Office". They should watch it. Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Kenny are the David Brent and Gareth Keenan of Irish politics, spending their days dreaming of witticisms for the next Order of Business. Where are the policies? Where are the skills to manage a Government among that rag-tag group? Even in Opposition, the Members cannot agree on Private Members' business. They are not a credible alternative. One could not let them run an office, let alone a country.

I am still waiting. Apart from the comedy, the catch phrases and the Order of Business witticisms, nothing has come  from the Opposition. Members of the Government do not have that luxury.The Estimates will ensure continued progress next year on critical priorities across the range of programmes within my brief. Today, after three years of global economic downturn, the national debt is half the euro zone average and there is 4.5% unemployment. Some 700,000 more people are working today than in the early 1990s. We have shown the world that Ireland did not go the way of many other tiger economies, and the job of the Government is to ensure this prosperity is permanent. This is the political decision the Government has made. The Estimates flow from that decision. It is about good management, securing long-term prosperity and not the short-term splurge the Deputies opposite advance. These are not the uncaring, unjust Opposition policies which offer Irish workers two choices, either the dole queue or the boat, which it did when in office, particularly in the mid-1980s. We offer jobs and refuse the short-term splurge of scarce resources. That is the difference between parties on this side of the House and the parties on the opposite side.The House will be aware that my Department has a wide-ranging economic remit. It has a key contribution to make in terms of growth, competitiveness and balanced regional development. The 2004 Estimate reflects the vital role the energy, telecommunications and maritime transport sectors play in delivering competitiveness in the Irish economy on the global stage. The Estimate will also address the challenges for indigenous marine and natural resource-based industry in terms of sustainable development and job creation in rural and coastal regions.My Department, like the rest of the Government, is about maintaining prosperity. There is no arguing with that fact. Since 1997, Fianna Fáil has slashed personal tax rates by 12%. The rainbow Government just managed a 1% cut. Unemployment today stands at 4.5%. This compares with 10.3% in 1997 and the day the rainbow Government left office. Most significant of all, Ireland's standard of living is estimated to have been 122% of the EU average in 2002. This compares with estimates of 103% for Germany, 102% for France and 103% for the United Kingdom. I remind Deputies that is 122% of the EU average.

These Estimates build on that progress. In today's more difficult economic climate, the importance of the significant reduction made in the national debt means that each year there is an additional €1 billion available for investment in vital public services such as health and education, previously paid for by debt servicing by the parties opposite.

These are not Fianna Fáil Estimates. These are the Estimates of the Progressive Democrats, declared as such by the leader of that party six years ago, and now supported by the PD wing of Fianna Fáil of which the Minister present appears to be an enthusiastic member. The Government appears to be fixated with 1997. It is as if 1997 was the beginning of history. We are led to believe that it is since then all the jobs and prosperity have been created. If one asks the Taoiseach a question on the Order of Business or during Question Time he can give statistics on anything that dates from 1997. What the Government forgets is that in 1997 it  inherited the government of this country from its predecessors with the public finances put back in the black by Deputy Quinn, new jobs being created at a rate of 50,000 per week and with the country teed up to provide the kind of revenues that have flowed into the State coffers for the past six years, which have been misspent and mismanaged by the present Government. The question is what did it do with the money and how was it spent.There are a set of statistics dating from 1997 about which we never hear from the Government. In 1997 the average price of a new house was €93,583. Today it is €222,532, an increase of 140%. In 1997 a tenant could rent a family size dwelling for €400 or €500, which today costs €1,200. In 1997 there were 26,000 applicants on local authority housing waiting lists. Today there are 60,000 on these waiting lists, more than double the number.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	912	In 1997 the average working family in this country could afford to buy a home of their own and today they cannot do so. In the past year the Government has made it even more difficult for young families to buy a home of their own. The Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant, increased building materials by putting an extra 1% VAT on them and introduced new development levies. It caved in to the building lobby by abolishing and undermining the affordable housing sites that should now be coming on stream with legislation which was introduced this time last year. Last year the Government cut the budget for social housing.I see what is in the Estimates for housing. There is an increase on the capital side for social housing from €931 million to €957 million, an increase of €26 million. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, by throwing in all the current spending, managed to make it €33 million at his press conference. He then announced that for €33 million he would build 500 additional dwellings. That works out at an average unit cost of €66,000 per dwelling. How on earth does one build, including site costs, a unit of housing anywhere of any kind for €66,000? The reality is that the Estimate will not provide for additional social housing. Neither will it provide the money committed to in the NDP for the voluntary housing sector, allowing it to build an additional 1,000 houses per year. It is geared up to do so but it has not been provided with the money with which to do it.The result is that there are 60,000 families on council waiting lists, who will be waiting an average of 12 to 15 years for local authority housing because of the Government's failure to provide for their needs. How will these people wait? In some cases they will wait in overcrowded conditions in the family home and in other cases they will wait by paying high rents to private landlords  for rented accommodation. These are the people who are being targeted by the Government for a most savage cut. Some 60,000 people cannot afford to pay the high rents being charged for private accommodation. This is why they are receiving rent allowance in the first instance. These are the people who have been targeted by the Government for the biggest cut in this year's Estimates. The decision to prohibit people from receiving rent allowance until they have been renting for six months in effect means that the rent allowance is being abolished. It is a savage cut which affects those at the lowest end of the earnings ladder. It is an attack by the Government on the men and women who have no property. What has happened to Fianna Fáil which used to boast that it was the party which was interested in such men and women and their concerns?There is no screed of evidence of concern in the Estimates. When the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources tells the House hard decisions have to be made to maintain our prosperity, what he means is that hard decisions have to be inflicted on the poor to maintain the prosperity of the rich. No Government can justify spending more on prizes for horse races than on providing for the housing needs of the poor. It is a shameful and scandalous decision. I cannot understand the reason members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, will support the Book of Estimates.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	915	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. In framing the Estimates the Government obviously kept in mind the priority of maintaining the conditions necessary for the economy to be strongly positioned to benefit from future economic growth. Recent indications from the United States and our own figures show an upturn, not only in the Ieconomy but also in the world economy. It is interesting to note that the German economy which has been stagnant for some years is witnessing new life.The prudent management of public expenditure, necessary to protect the significant economic progress of the past ten years, remains the single most important aim of the Government. One does not have to go back too many years when our complete income tax take was used to service the national debt. I do not think any honest Member wants to return to those dark days. The Minister for Finance has said rolling back our tax reforms is not an option. He has also said lower taxation has been good for the country and that he intends to stick to this path. Those are strong words. He is reflecting the views of the Government and all Government Deputies in  that statement. The vast majority of the public will welcome this firm commitment by him. Given that over 500,000 more are in employment since 1987, it is sweet music to their ears also. The vast majority of workers would like to see the top rate of income tax reduced further by 2% to 40%. Perhaps by the time the Government leaves office in three years' time, this goal will have been achieved.Economic growth has slowed significantly during the past two years. This lower economic growth means lower Revenue growth which acts as a constraint on the Government in the area of expenditure. It is curious to listen to members of the Opposition speak about increased Government spending, yet they are not prepared to commit themselves to a higher tax regime or identify where savings can be made in the Government's expenditure programme. Limiting public expenditure to agreed targets means we can avoid a return to the higher levels of taxation and the excessive levels of borrowing common in the 1980s. I am pleased the Minister has confirmed that close scrutiny will be kept on public spending during the course of the next year.The Estimates confirm the priority this Administration has given to areas such as health, education, social welfare and infrastructural development. It is extraordinary that spending on health, education and social welfare will account for over two thirds of Government's expenditure in 2004. That is a commitment, if one wants evidence of a commitment to these areas.While the country has prospered and the vast majority of its citizens have benefited from the increased wealth generated in the past ten years, we have a social obligation to look after the less fortunate in society. In this regard I was pleased to hear from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, that the Government had committed €10 billion to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for 2004. On top of this, the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement next month will announce increases in social welfare payments. There is an obvious saving to the Exchequer when unemployment levels are of the order of 4.4% because the more in employment the more that will be paid in taxes reducing the drain on the public purse.One area about which I am disappointed is that of capital expenditure for infrastructural purposes. In this regard I would like a commitment that work on the intercity routes promised under the national development plan will proceed. I have in mind the N9 route from Dublin to Waterford and the chronic situation in my constituency in Carlow where bottlenecks which used to be frequent at weekends are now a daily occurrence in Carlow town due to the volume of Dublin and Waterford traffic.I welcome the Estimates and commend the Minister for Finance on bringing them to Government. I trust he will continue to hold a tight rein on public expenditure in 2004.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	916	I thank my colleague, Deputy Nolan, for sharing his time with me.The Estimates provision for my Department for 2004 is €1.39 billion. The gross Estimate figure includes a sum of €108 million in respect of forestry, responsibility for which will be transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to my Department from 1 January 2004.The gross allocation for 2004 represents an increase of €62.2 million or 5% over the corresponding 2003 figures, of which just over €25 million relates to forestry and €37 million to agriculture and food. However, when account is taken of the reduced expenditure requirements related to BSE in 2004 and the improved disease situation, the gross expenditure provision for the Department of Agriculture and Food in 2004 has been increased by 8%. After projected receipts, the corresponding estimated net expenditure allocation for 2004 is €935.1 million.I welcome the increased Exchequer funding for my Department in 2004 but in addition to the figure of €1.39 billion in the Estimates, my Department is responsible for expending a further €1.6 billion on EU funded agricultural measures. This will bring total expenditure to approximately €3 billion in 2004. It also equates to direct payments amounting to an average of approximately €13,000 per farmer in 2004. This is a high level of public expenditure and underlines the continuing commitment of the Government to the agri-food and forestry sectors.While most areas of my Department will receive increased allocations in 2004, the gross Estimate also contains lower provisions for some areas, particularly general disease control and market supports. These lower provisions are due to positive developments such as the ongoing improvements in the BSE position and improved market conditions for agricultural products. The improvements in these areas are welcome and will boost farm income generally.Next year's overall provision for animal health, disease eradication and related measures is approximately €165 million. Within this figure, I am providing €68.88 million for the operational costs of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. As regards TB, the number of reactors removed has decreased steadily in recent years, dropping from just under 45,000 in 1998 to 28,900 last year, a reduction of approximately one third. The improvement in the brucellosis situation in recent years is continuing with new restrictions so far this year down by 66% on the comparable date in 1998. While the position on both diseases is encouraging, it is imperative that the stringent regimes in place are continued for some time yet.The 2004 Estimates include a provision of €80.455 million for general disease control. This represents a reduction of €68 million on the 2003 allocation and reflects ongoing improvements in Ireland's BSE situation. For example, latest figures available show that the number of BSE cases  for this year is 161 compared with 293 for the same period in 2002, which equates to a 45% reduction in BSE figures. The effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls was recognised by the EU scientific steering committee which indicated in a report on Ireland's BSE risk, published in May 2000, that controls were stable from 1996 onwards, very stable from 1997 on and optimally stable since 1 January 1998.The 2004 allocation also reflects a decision to end Exchequer funding for BSE testing during 2004 which will transfer additional costs to the industry in the coming year of approximately €2.9 million. EU funding of approximately €5 million will continue to be passed on, and therefore the industry will not bear the full costs of these tests.The single largest increase in funding in 2004 for which the Estimates provide, is for the rural environmental protection scheme. That is an increase of €70 million on the 2003 allocation. This is a good scheme in which I encourage all farmers to participate. We are reducing the amount of bureaucracy associated with it and making it as simple as possible. There is €260 million available for farmers next year and the more farmers who apply for that the happier I will be. It is 75% funded from the EU. Last year €190 million was allocated and only €170 million spent because too few farmers applied.I am pleased also that the 2004 allocations for my Department's two main on-farm investment schemes, the farm waste management and the dairy hygiene schemes, have been increased by 58% and 67% respectively.In conclusion, the overall allocation for agriculture, food and forestry is substantial. The Estimate for my Department must be looked at alongside the €1.6 billion we are spending on agriculture, that is a total of €3 billion. This is directly comparable with last year's figures. Forestry is included this year but that was factored into the accounts. The decoupling of support from production will create an environment which will be more orientated towards consumer needs and should allow clear market signals. This augurs well for the future of Irish agriculture which is entering a new and interesting phase in its development. I am greatly encouraged by the positive attitudes and determination of all the stakeholders involved to make the best of the new circumstances.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The actions of this Government in deciding on a further raft of stealth taxes and social welfare cuts can be compared to the activities of Fagin and his band of pickpockets. The Minister for Finance is a postgraduate of the Fagin academy, magna cum ignominia, for introducing the most comprehensive range of pickpocket taxes against the most needy and vulnerable in our society. The mind boggles at the thought of Fagin in a hairshirt. The entire Government could be said to be members of the  graduate class of 2004 from this august seat of learning because pickpocket taxes extend across the full range of Government services and most Departments. Pickpockets by nature operate stealthily and these extra taxes are designed in such a way that people pay them unwittingly.At the same time the Minister's hand is in the pocket of every family in the country to the tune of over €1,300 a year, or €91 million in all. Local authority housing waiting lists standing at over 52,000 families are likely to lengthen with the proposed housing levy of between €10,000 and €20,000 amounting to a reconstructed poll tax reminiscent of the worst aspects of Thatcher's Britain. Undoubtedly those seeking to secure a foothold on the housing ladder will be driven into local authority housing schemes with consequent pressure on the authorities. They have recently confessed to failure in their efforts to trim housing lists and have indicated that the future is in apartments following the lead of Central Europe. The vision of the founder of the original Sinn Féin party and the apostle of self-sufficiency, Arthur Griffith, that every family would have a house and garden appears to have been discarded in favour of assembly line uniformity.Education has been clobbered once again, on top of last year's 69% increase in college registration fees, there is another hit of €80, or 12%, and exam fees are up by 15%. The unfortunate motorist has to cough up a further 12% in motor tax while TV licences, VHI premiums, hospital accident and emergency charges and even passports have risen by 32%. The drug refund threshold has been raised by 11% together with earnings thresholds for unemployment benefit and disability benefit. Deputy Rabbitte documented the 16 social welfare cuts today. What is really facing people 18 months into the Government's promise of "A lot done more to do"? People may ask where extra taxes are going because they observe public services getting worse. Parents see their children's schools disintegrating due to neglect. Motorists know that the roads are more congested than ever and that every journey into the country is an ordeal. Hospital patients are required to wait for days on end on trolleys in hospitals and accident and emergency departments, that is in hospitals which still have those departments.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	918	Tá mé an-bhuíoch as bheith in ann caint ar an rud seo. Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le hÉamon Ó Cuív as an airgead a thug sé don western development fund, doubling that. It is very small, but still, tá fáilte roimhe.The north-west of Mayo is the most deprived area in Ireland as proved by the figures in the census. Horses are receiving prize money of €67 million and there is funding of €50 million for the Punchestown centre. If we were treated like animals we might do better. We could survive. Our regional airport in Knock is underresourced while significant sums of money are going into the other  international airports. Knock Airport has existed for 17 years, was built for very little and run on very little. It is the one great hope we have in the BMW area but it has been seriously underfunded.I thank the Government for its support of the Safe Home organisation which has brought home, or provided accommodation for 226 people, but when one considers the large amount of money that our emigrants gave to this country when it had no other support, this is a minuscule contribution to our emigrants. DÍON is doing wonderful work but it has much the same funding. The Minister is giving it an extra €1 million. The emigrants would have sent back about £300 million over two decades which is just the tip of the iceberg because they gave so much in the past and kept this country alive when it had no other hope. In his forward to the task force report the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said that it represented a new approach to meeting the needs of our emigrants, particularly the most vulnerable who have the greatest need. The Minister may be very sincere but it is a pity this was not matched by the funding he said would be available. He said that in year 1, 2003, there would be €18 million rising to €34 million in 2005 but the figure in the Estimate falls far short of that.If those emigrants had stayed at home and we had to look after them they could not have sent the money they did. We are now benefiting from the fact that they went. Substantial expenditure would have been needed to support them in their old age. In 1999 the elderly in Ireland represented 11.4% of the total population compared to the EU average of 16.1% so they are gone and we do not have to pay for them, yet we should recognise them. The expenditure on public pensions amounted to 3.4% of GDP compared to the EU average of 12.1% which shows what we would have had to pay had they stayed, in contrast to what they have given us. I hope that this can be changed in the budget but that will not happen unless the Minister brings in another Estimate.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	919	I think it was Deputy Nolan who spoke briefly about the German economy and how it is now re-emerging from the doldrums. In fact the German economy under Hans Eichel has had to make huge cuts, particularly in public services. I do not see that as a particularly good model any longer because the Germans now see us as a model, a society that has for years indulged in huge cuts, which have clearly affected our public services.Today we see the effect on our own society. A Supreme Court decision today awarded huge costs against women who were asserting their right to home births. This was an appalling decision. They were simply challenging our two-tiered health system so that they could have home births regardless of their financial circumstances. These women had medical cards.One judges a society on the basis of its health service. It is now clear that we are indeed moving  closer to Boston than Berlin. That can be seen in our health service. I ask the Tánaiste what has happened to the 200,000 people who were to qualify for medical cards. The promise was made in the Fianna Fáil manifesto. What has happened the 3,000 beds promised under the health strategy? What has happened all the strategies to deal with the accident and emergency crisis? We see people on trolleys. The Estimates tackle none of this.When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, launched the Fianna Fáil economic manifesto, he promised that there would be an additional €1,102 million for health capital funding. That was his promise. For 2004 he promised an additional €1,141 million for that same funding. The Estimates tell a completely different story. Unfortunately, what we are again witnessing are election promises, a series of lies and people reneging totally on those promises.The drugs payment refund threshold has now increased by 46%. Once again, people are suffering as a consequence. This is right-wing ideology gone mad, and no party represents that better than the Progressive Democrats.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	920	The Estimates provide for over €40 billion in public spending next year. That is well over €10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. This €40 billion is provided by the hard work of Irish people. The Government's first job is to manage and invest public money wisely on their behalf. That means delivering the public services they expect. It means getting value for public money and spending money within a sustainable social and economic strategy. Within these Estimates we have set priorities with limited and precious public resources. We are maintaining overall public spending in line with our capacity to pay and economic growth.At 5% growth pre-budget, we are increasing public spending at a moderate rate that will not put a strain on jobs and the economy. We are maintaining steady progress within the speed limits for our economy. We are neither braking hard nor accelerating dangerously. Our economic progress means we can still grow public spending at twice the average expected for European countries next year. For example, general Government spending in France is expected to increase by 2.7%, in Germany by 1.5%, in Finland by 3.5% and in Britain by 5.5%. To grow public spending in line with our economic ability to pay puts the focus on the policies to achieve our economic potential. We have shown in recent years that economic performance is the engine of social justice, public resources and sustainable public services. We will continue to give priority to policies and actions that maximise our economic growth potential, including investment, competition, and low taxes. In the Estimates, we have prioritised investment in our social and economic future in the areas of health, education and infrastructure.  Each of these investments will build a sustainable and successful society and economy. Our social commitment will be sustained next year by further increases in social welfare to be finalised on budget day.Our €340 million investment in research and development, across Science Foundation Ireland, health research and Teagasc, will also deliver long-term rewards. Next year, we will spend €10 billion on health services. Our health spending is up 43% in the three years since 2001, the most recent year for OECD statistics. No other European country has increased health spending at this rate. In France, for example, the Government indicated that there were "particularly steep increases" in 2001 and 2002, referring to health spending increases of 4% at constant prices. We are a young population and we are devoting a lot of resources already to health. We are making the investment. We have brought forward the reform package. Now it is time for action and results.The Government is totally determined to implement the health reforms that put patients first. It will be step by step, beginning now, over the coming years, backed by sustained political will. I am also confident that the 100,000 people working in health can, and will, deliver results.As regards the full public service, we are providing for a considerable increase of €1.1 billion for pay and pensions. The Government will meet its side of the bargain under benchmarking and Sustaining Progress. Now it is up to every part of the public sector to step up to the plate and deliver the returns on this investment of scarce public resources. We are making provision for 50% of the benchmarking award, amounting to €305 million. This is one sixth of the overall increase in public spending next year. Let us be clear about it and not exaggerate it. It is one sixth of the increase in public spending, and not, as some Fine Gael people have suggested, the entirety of it. There are 1.8 million people at work in Ireland, with 300,000 of them eligible for benchmarking increases. To be fair, the results must be seen by all 4 million of us in our country.In every area of economic life we demand more value for our money. Our jobs and our prosperity depend on delivering higher value added products and services. Countries work very hard to achieve productivity improvements of 3%. It is not easy. It is not achieved by trivial changes. It takes hard work, innovation and a willingness to embrace substantial change as a normal part of working life.This applies also to the public sector, even though it is more difficult to measure productivity there. The public is entitled to see significant and continuous change in our public services in return for the generous benchmarking awards. The benchmarking awards were not agreed by the Government in the hope of substantial change, but rather, in return for substantial and continuous change. Unlike some others, I believe the public service can meet this challenge next year and in the years ahead.I turn now to my own Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Estimate under Vote 34 for 2004 is €1.124 billion. This is an overall increase of 3% over 2003. Clearly, within the overall increase, the Government has taken decisions on increases and reductions based on economic and social priorities. As regards community employment, the Government has decided, in the context of the Estimates, that there will be no further reduction in the number of places to be supported under the community employment scheme next year. The number of places to be supported next year will not drop below the end 2003 target of 20,000. The total allocation for employment schemes in 2004 has been fixed at €351 million, which will support up to 25,000 places across three employment schemes, namely, community employment, jobs initiative and the social economy programme. FÁS is being given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.Our industrial promotion strategy is now augmented by a significant increase in funding for research and development. This is a critical part of our economic strategy going forward. We are very clear that Ireland will compete in the future on the basis of higher value added activities. These in turn are based on leading edge research and development, the foundation of what we call a "knowledge economy".Overall spending on science and technology will increase by 36% over 2003 levels. The budget for Science Foundation Ireland has been increased by €53 million to bring it up to €201million. This will fund the ambitious research programme it is now putting in place. It is an investment in jobs and knowledge for the future. Enterprise Ireland will also see a significant increase in the moneys available to it to support innovation and research within industry. Funding to promote greater awareness of science, particularly among young people, is also being increased.The Estimates provide for modest reductions in funding for industry grants through the development agencies. This is appropriate given the changing nature of our employment profile, increased emphasis on research and development and the reduced need for traditional grant supports for industry. Over €138 million in grants will be provided for industry through IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.The Estimates provide funding to facilitate the establishment on a statutory basis of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Government has now published the Bill. With the support of the Oireachtas, I expect the board to be up and running early in 2004. Once fully operational, it will be funded on an ongoing basis by fees levied on respondents and it is the intention that Exchequer funding will not be required beyond 2004. I am fully confident that the board will  deliver excellent value for money. It will be effective in processing the claims of injured parties as well as in keeping insurance costs down.I commend to the House the Government's decision to increase overseas aid this year by €25 million bringing it to €399 million. The people around the world who receive the benefit of our aid will receive real additional help from Ireland. Some see our aid budget as a luxury when spending is being controlled elsewhere. I believe it fits with the values and wishes of the people. We are staying true to our commitment to help the poorest people of the world. I commend the Estimates to the House.

The public will yet again be subjected to another raft of stealth taxes, bringing in a total of €91 million for the year. Everyone agrees that these taxes are most regressive. They usually impinge hardest on those who are least able to pay and ability to pay does not arise. Hospital accident and emergency charges are to go up by €5 to €45 per visit. Nightly in-patient charges are to go up by €5 to €45 per night while the drugs payment refund threshold has been increased by another €8 to €78, almost double the figure in recent years.The motorist does not escape either. Motor tax for a 1.4 litre car is increased by €14 to €292 per annum. This is rich coming from a party which abolished road tax on motor vehicles in 1977, also to purchase an election.Young people and students are not to be spared. In recent months an attempt was made to reintroduce third level fees, a proposal on which the jury seems to be out. However, the Government has now decided to burden already hard-pressed students by imposing further charges. Student registration fees are being increased by €80 on this occasion bringing them to a total of €750. This is a cruel decision.Even those attending second level schools are not spared. Fees for the junior and leaving certificate examinations are being increased by €10 bringing them to €82 and €86, respectively. This is a vicious form of stealth tax on our youth and the very essence of education. How can the Minister justify such a regressive tax?Even passports are not exempt. The fee for a ten year passport is being increased by €18 bringing it to a total of €75.The real scandal is to be found in the area of social and family affairs. It is estimated that €58 million will be saved by the Exchequer by way of 16 separate reductions in eligibility for various allowances which include lone parent's allowance, rent allowance, back-to-education allowance and special dietary needs allowance. How can the Government justify such cruel cuts being  inflicted on the poorest and most vulnerable sections of our community?While total spending is being increased in the Estimates by 5% or almost €1.9 billion, most of this amount, approximately €1.2 billion, will go towards pay increases and benchmarking.There is a shortfall of €42 million in the annual Exchequer allowance to local authorities. We know this will result in increases in commercial rates, development levies and other charges. An already overburdened commercial sector will find it difficult to meet these extra charges. Local authorities are already strapped for cash and will be expected to come with another €42 million. Schemes such as the essential repairs grant schemes, housing aid for the elderly and disabled person's grants have been virtually abolished and are at a standstill.My colleague, Deputy Keogh, noted that the Minister for Defence had spoken in the House this morning. It is amazing that he did not refer to the situation in his Department.

There is a net reduction in its allocations. When one considers €40 million was knocked off its Estimates last year, one understands very well the reason the Minister did not feel like or have the courage to speak about his Department when he came into the House this morning, which must be a first for a Minister. As a result of the cuts made last year, a number of schemes had to be cancelled. Orders for search and rescue helicopters, personnel carriers and pistols were cancelled while the scheme for deafness claims was curtailed. The strength of the Defence Forces is now at an all-time low with approximately 10,000 members. There is a significant cutback in the Defence Forces' Estimates. There is a reduction of 22% in the Estimate for the Naval Service at a time when the Naval Service ships are confined to port. This requires an explanation. I understand very well the reason the Minister did not mention his Department when he spoke in the House this morning.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	924	The Tánaiste stated the Government was determined to implement the health reforms that put patients first. It will be step by step over the coming year backed by sustained political will. I ask the House to examine the step by step approach of the Government in the Estimates to those who are sick. I ask the Tánaiste if the step by step increases in charges for those who are sick are acceptable to her and her colleagues in the Government. They clearly are but they are not acceptable to the people, particularly to those who are ill.One of the most savage and unacceptable decisions of the Government in the last two years has been to amend the drugs refund scheme. When it took office in 2002, the monthly charge  for medicines was €65. The Government met the remainder of the cost. It then increased to €70 the threshold which now stands at €78 out of a very small income in the case of those who did not receive a medical card as the Government had promised. They are on low incomes and very ill. Under the Government, the sicker one is, the more one pays. This is utterly shameful and unacceptable. I do not understand how the Government reached the decision to tax the sick. Asthma is a common illness which results in the hospitalisation of many thousands when it is not treatable at community level. Many will go without inhalers because they cannot afford to buy them.Doctors' fees are increasing, in some cases unacceptably so. Although market forces are involved, there should be a regulatory ceiling for doctors' fees because in some cases they are unacceptably high.Look at the step by step approach of the Minister for Health and Children in the North-Eastern Health Board following the last budget. The North-Eastern Health Board rejected the plan last year to cut 80,000 hours from the home help service for counties Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan but the Minister signed off on that decision. As a result of the policies of this Government, on 80,000 occasions people who were sick, who had been discharged from hospital and were in need of care did not get it. It is reprehensible that the savage cuts made by this Government impact on the sick and the poor.The attack on those on low incomes is also savage. A single mother with one or two children often wants to stay in the family home but cannot do so due to other pressures. The Government now says that it will pay rent allowance provided that person can rent a place outside the home for six months. These people will find it increasingly difficult and the health of the mother and the children will suffer. The Minister's cut will drive people back into the rat infested hovels of the past that had disappeared in recent years. They will re-open their doors to the poor who cannot get rent allowance from the Government.In today's edition of The Irish Times, Dr. Chris Luke stated that cocaine represents an appalling hazard, “the most worrisome of all hazards facing Irish young people”, as he put it, and is behind some of the hideous atrocities that have happened in Ireland in recent times. What is this Government doing to combat cocaine abuse? It is not making any additional funding available under the national drugs strategy to fight it. This Government is a shambles.

I am particularly pleased that the allocation of over €430 million to my Department, an increase of 8% on the 2003 allo cation of €399.5 million, will enable me to maintain the thrust of State support for the arts, sports and tourism sectors.I am happy to announce significantly increased funding of €52.5 million for the Arts Council in 2004, an increase of 19% on the 2003 provision. Artists and arts organisations have every reason to be optimistic about their sector. I have appointed a new Arts Council, the composition of which has been widely and warmly welcomed. Members of the Arts Council have a record of distinguished service and achievement in many walks of life and they will bring energy and dynamism to the arts.I have secured an increase of 9% in funding for the Irish Film Board in 2004. The board is at the heart of the Government's strategy to promote indigenous films and film makers and the funding being provided for 2004 is solid evidence of this fact.As a reflection of my responsibility under the Arts Act 2003 to promote Irish art at home and abroad, a total of €6.7 million has been provided for the promotion of Irish art abroad in 2004. Apart from the ongoing funding of the cultural relations committee, €2.1 million is being provided for the festivals of Irish culture to take place in Beijing and Shanghai in May and June 2004 and for the incoming festival of Chinese culture in Ireland later in the year.The Estimates for my Department also include the provision of €3.9 million for the organisation of the cultural programme that will surround the Irish Presidency of the European Union. The forthcoming Irish Presidency will be unique in that the ten accession countries will formally join the Union on 1 May and it is intended to mark this event across Ireland in a special way. It is also the intention to use the period of the Presidency to forge new cultural links with the accession countries.Next year marks the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday. Last year I appointed a special committee to co-ordinate the many events that will be organised in celebration of that anniversary. An exciting cultural and tourism programme is being developed under the title "ReJoyce Dublin 2004" and it is being promoted internationally. The Estimate includes €900,000 to support the efforts of the committee. The centrepiece of these celebrations will be a major exhibition in the National Library of Ireland, the leading repository in the world of Joycean material, for which an allocation of €1.8 has been provided.The 2004 allocations will also enable the National Museum of Ireland to proceed with a planned military history exhibition to be held in Collins Barracks in 2005. This exhibition will tell the story of the ordinary Irish soldier at home and abroad from the late 16th century until today.Also included in the Estimate for my Department is a provision of €3.175 million by way of a first instalment of the Government's committee to the Cork city of culture in 2005.The value of sport to the nation cannot be  over-emphasised. An active, healthy population is the backbone of a stable and secure society. Additionally, all of us take great satisfaction from outstanding performances by Irish sports people in the sporting arenas of the world. The provision of €176 million for sport in 2004, in comparison with the allocation of €17 million in 1997, is indicative of the Government's commitment to sport.I am particularly pleased that the allocation for the local authority swimming pool scheme has been improved to €15 million in the 2004 Estimates. Under the sports capital programme €267 million has been allocated to 3,500 projects across the State. The combined provisions of €30.75 million in respect of the Irish Sports Council will enable it to continue to support and enhance its wide range of programmes in the coming year.Following the publication of the Estimates for public services last week, some commentators, particularly Deputy Rabbitte, sought to portray in the most misplaced and negative terms the provision in the Estimates for my Department of funding for Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland. The level of funding proposed in 2004 is based on the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and is in accordance with legislation.Horse racing and greyhound racing are major industries that provide significant employment and create wealth for the economy. Direct and indirect employment in horse racing and associated industries amounts to 25,000 people. There are more people employed in the equine sector in County Kildare than in information technology, despite the location of the Intel and Hewlett Packard enterprises in that county. The comparative employment figure for greyhound racing is 6,000 direct full-time jobs and 10,000 indirect and part-time jobs. The breeding and racing of thoroughbreds generates significant economic activity in Ireland, contributing to gross national product. The value of assets employed in breeding and racing is conservatively estimated to be €2.5 billion.It is incorrect to say that the bloodstock industry is exempt from tax. Breeders and owners are liable for tax in the same way as all other sectors of farming. Profits made by Irish tax residents from trading in bloodstock in Ireland or overseas are liable for taxation here.One sector of the industry has enjoyed a tax concession since the late 1960s, namely, income from stallion fees. It is the location of the stallions that attracts the mares and the inward investment of overseas owners and breeders, with consequent benefits for rural employment and the balance of payments. The tax concession can be equated to incentives for other industries, such as the 1% manufacturing relief and IDA and Forfás grants, and undoubtedly gives Ireland a competitive edge over international competitors. Thoroughbred breeding is one area where Ireland is a genuine world leader, with only the  US state of Kentucky comparable in terms of intensity and economic importance. Despite our relative size, only America and Australia produce more foals annually. We account for 42% of the total EU output of thoroughbreds and more foals are born in Ireland annually than in Britain and France combined.While the top stallions can be phenomenally successful, the majority of the 382 at stud in Ireland do not succeed and their owners struggle to recover their investment. The growth output of the breeding sector alone is estimated to be worth €180 million per annum, accounting for 4% of total gross agricultural output.The betting industry also generates substantial economic activity. Off-course betting in 2002 totalled €1.6 billion and total betting on-course amount to €208 million.It is interesting to note these figures because they show that Deputy Rabbitte is wrong. He does not have to take my word for it. I will quote from an informed contribution on Second Stage of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Bill to be found in the Official Report, 17 May 2001, vol. 536, cols. 863-868. This might finally enlighten Deputy Rabbitte:There are 30,000 people gainfully employed, either directly or indirectly, by the industry. It is, therefore, a significant contributor to the Exchequer; the benefits permeate through the economy and help to sustain rural villages. I hope everyone gains from the Bill: those who work in the yards, the head lads, grooms and stable boys and stable girls. Sometimes they were not overpaid – let us put it that way – and though they are now looked after by the minimum wage I hope everyone now shares in the prosperity. That is very important.Increased funding of both industries on a sustained, guaranteed basis, most importantly, for their ongoing development is to be heartily welcomed.The contribution of horse racing to the State. . . . is particularly important in terms of employment. I concur with the Minister on the significant contribution of horse racing to rural development in particular. It has been a significant alternative industry and will probably assume greater significance because of the alternative enterprise scheme. . . . It is an important source of income for farms both as a principal and supporting enterprise, particularly in my area.Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. . . . will receive a sum equivalent to the revenue generated from excise duty in the preceding year, or else £46 million as indexed from the Consumer Price Index. I am glad there is a base and that the bodies will receive whatever sum is greater.These are the words of a Labour Deputy on 17 May 2001 in this House. Hopefully this has educated Deputy Rabbitte as it is the considered opinion of the man whom he supported for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party last year,  Deputy Penrose. However, political connoisseurs and cynics alike will have no difficulty—

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	928	Good man John.Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon): To listen to the contributions of the Opposition speakers on the Estimates for 2004 one might be forgiven for forming the impression that the Estimates are simply a combination of cutbacks and stealth taxes aimed at the poor and designed to undermine the economic and social progress achieved in recent years, with no economic strategy underpinning them. Nothing could be further from the reality.The 2004 Estimates provide for a total expenditure on public services of €40.4 billion in 2004, an increase of €1.9 billion or a 5% increase on the forecast outturn for 2003. The overall increase in provision for public spending is ahead of the rate of inflation which is currently running at 2.3 %.The Government has given priority in the Estimates to the key areas of health, education, social welfare and infrastructural investment. The provision for health spending is over €10 billion, an increase of €739 million, or 8%, over the forecast outturn for 2003. The gross allocation for education and science is €6.5 billion, an increase of €674 million, or 11%, on the forecast outturn for 2003. The total pre-budget allocation for social welfare, at €10.6 billion, is the single biggest expenditure provision in the Estimates – this before the budget day additions for social welfare rate increases. As the Minister for Finance pointed out in his address, there has been a very significant increase in real terms in the level of social welfare provision since 1997 which has resulted in real increases in benefits for social welfare recipients.The changes in eligibility conditions for some social welfare payments arise from ongoing reviews of relevant schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives. The economies arising will amount to an estimated €56 million which represents just over a half of 1% of the total gross pre-budget provision of €10.6 billion for social welfare.Opposition speakers have accused the Government of seeking to introduce stealth taxes and promoting increased charges in order to fund the proposed increases in public spending. The total value of additional charges, including motor tax increases, is estimated at some €91 million. This represents less than 0.3% of the total gross provision of over €40 billion in public spending provided for in the 2004 Estimates.The cost of the increase in health charges amounts to €35 million which is not even 0.5% of the gross 2004 health budget of €10 billion. The cost of the increase in examination charges and third level student registration charges is estimated at €5.8 million which represents less than 0.1 % of the gross provision for public spending in education in 2004. The increases are, for the most part, adjustments to cover a small part of the costs of providing the relevant services and form part of a measured approach to ensuring the provision of these services.A number of the Opposition Deputies have criticised the level of investment proposed for infrastructure. The Government is accused by Deputy Richard Bruton of adopting a "stop-go approach" to infrastructural provision which could undermine attempts to address the country's infrastructural deficit and our competitiveness. The reality is that the Government has deliberately ratcheted up and maintained annual Exchequer capital investment at around 5% of GNP in the past few years in order to give priority to addressing the infrastructural deficit.While the rate of increase in latter years is not as dramatic as that in earlier years, this reflects concerns about the impact that the levels of increases in those early years were having on construction cost inflation. The ESRI has stressed the importance of ensuring that similar inflationary pressures to those of the 1999-2001 period do not arise again over the remainder of the national development plan.The 2004 Exchequer provision of €5.5 billion for capital investment is two and three quarter times the 1997 expenditure of €2 billion. As a result, annual Exchequer investment in infrastructure is currently running at historically high levels. It is twice the current EU average. Subject to an overall sustainable budgetary situation, the Government is committed to maintaining capital investment in public infrastructure at similarly high levels in the medium term.The acceleration in capital spending has helped fund the infrastructure programme of the national development plan. The ESRI, in its independent mid-term evaluation of the NDP, found that overall expenditure under the key economic and social infrastructure operational programme was ahead of the plan target by 5%. It also found that expenditure on local infrastructure under the regional operational programmes was also performing well, with expenditure on non-national roads in particular being well ahead of targeted spend.The ESRI has recommended that investment  in infrastructure should continue to be the key priority under the plan. The Government has accepted its recommendation in this regard and the 2004 NDP provision for economic and social infrastructure is broadly in line with the ESRI's recommendation.As regards the ESRI criticisms of capital project overruns and programme management, the Minister for Finance has indicated in his contribution to this debate that the value for money issues are being addressed through the revision of the Department of Finance guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital projects in the public sector. He also stated that he favours the introduction of a multiannual capital investment framework to give greater certainty to Departments and public bodies as to the availability of resources for capital investment in the medium term and that he will return to this subject on budget day.Deputy Boyle claims that there is no vision underpinning the 2004 Estimate while Deputy Richard Bruton indicated that the opportunity of unprecedented growth levels of the late 1990s to 2002 have been squandered and that there were no structural reforms in the 2004 Estimates. It was the sensible economic and budgetary policies of the Government which contributed in no small way to the achievement of unprecedented growth levels of the order of 10%, referred to by Deputy Bruton, which continued to ensure that the economy performs comparatively well.Ireland is a small, open economy and cannot be immune to the impact of developments in the international economy. Despite the international economic downturn in recent years, Ireland's growth rate is still well above the EU average. The EU Commission projects GDP growth for Ireland of 3.7% in 2004, compared to growth in the EU 15 of just 2%. Our unemployment rate of 4.4%, down from 10.3% in 1997, is currently half that of the EU rate and our general Government debt level, at an estimated 34% of GDP, is the second lowest. This is an impressive performance and is the reason the Government can continue to provide for increases in public expenditure without having to resort to tax increases or excessive levels of borrowings.The Estimates have been prepared against the background this year of a slower than expected upturn in the international economy.

The conclusions of the performance verification groups which have been established to monitor progress in implementing change will be examined in this regard. If groups or sectors breach the terms of Sustaining Progress, payments will not be made in those areas. To provide quality public services which benefit all sectors of society, we must continue to pay public servants at reasonably comparable rates to the private sector if we are to continue to attract and retain good quality public servants.The commitment shown by Ministers with the support of Government Deputies to implementing Government economic and social policies and the sound management of the public finances, as displayed in this debate, will be to the benefit of the people in coming years. Our approach of sound management of the public finances and seeking to consolidate the progress of recent years in order that we position the econ omy to reap the maximum benefits of the expected upturn in the international economy is the only sensible way forward. I commend the motion to the House.

This has happened under various Governments and some of those opposite have served in Government too. We responded to those challenges and the criminal justice system has always emerged stronger from them.The circumstances surrounding the case in Limerick mentioned in the motion also present a challenge to the criminal justice system. While we will respond to the challenge, we will not do so in a knee-jerk manner. We will respond to it as we are compelled to do, namely, in a way that is consistent with preserving, in so far as we can, the rights and freedoms given to the people under the Constitution. While this State has an enormous amount of weapons in its arsenal to deal with crime, we must respond in a proportionate and measured manner.Fianna Fáil is not the only party to have been in power. If successive Governments responded to occasional crises and problems in the criminal justice system—Mr.

He pointed out that most murders since 1997 are not, in so far as can be determined, gangland related. However, the statistics relating to the city I represent are somewhat different. There have been 40 murders in Limerick since 1997, most of them gang-related. The chief superintendent of the Limerick Garda division has supplied figures relating to these murders.There were four murder investigations in 1997, all of which were successfully concluded and files were sent to the DPP. The four murder investigations in 1998 were all successfully concluded and files were sent to the DPP. All three murder investigations in 1999 were successfully concluded and files were sent to the DPP. The five murder investigations in 2000 were all successfully concluded and files were sent to the DPP. In 2001, all ten murder investigations were successfully concluded and files were sent to the DPP. Of the seven murder investigations in 2002, all have been successfully concluded with the exception of two cases still under active investigation. Files will be forwarded to the DPP on those cases in the near future. To date in 2003, there have been seven murder investigations, of which three have been successfully concluded and files sent to the DPP. A file is being prepared for submission to the DPP in one case while the remaining three cases are under active investigation. The record from 1997 to date is that 36 of 40 cases, 90%, have been solved.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	975	Those statistics tell us a number of things. They point to the major success of the Garda in Limerick in dealing with these murders, many of which are the product of organised crime. It also demonstrates that the gardaí can call on whatever assistance they need when they require it. While all human life is sacred and any murder is to be regretted, seven murders have been committed to date this year and ten murders occurred in 2001. That gives the lie to the notion  that there is an unstoppable upsurge in the homicide rate in Limerick.The one positive feature of last night's debate was the statement by Deputy Kenny who said he would support the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Government's attempt to tackle this latest problem in the criminal justice system. He did this while his spokesman on justice acted like the political version of an ambulance-chasing lawyer, jumping up and down with sanctimonious posturing and pretending that he had instant elixirs, instant solutions, a silver bullet, if the House will excuse the pun.

The solution has already been put in place. I appeal to all sides of the House to stand in solidarity with the Government against these small criminal thugs who propose to take on the State.

A disproportionate number of those killings have happened in the constituency represented by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and me. We must stop the murders. I am aware of the depth of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's determination and the extent of the Garda commitment to effectively tackle this problem. The hysteria and hyperbole from organisations, such as the GRA, and Fine Gael does not help in any way. The publics want positive action and wants the Minister and the gardaí to do their jobs. Instead of being negative and critical, let us all get behind the Garda and the Minister and support them in their work.

We have advertised for submissions from the public on this matter. I  hope this will be a forum where the public can put forward serious submissions that can be taken on board and included in the recommendations of the committee.In Dublin South-Central, policing forums operate in Rialto and the south-west inner city network area. These have been established so that the public can voice its opinions, concerns and observations in open meetings with gardaí. Both forums and community-based groups co-operate and work well with the Garda. There is a need to leverage the communications these forums present to solve and follow up on the local challenges that are addressed at monthly meetings. Criminality grows in these disadvantaged and deprived areas. If it can be tackled at that point, it will help to secure a dramatic improvement. There is a need for a co-ordinator to be funded, either one for each of the forums or one to be shared by them. This is a matter I will ask the Minister to address.I have a list of items that Fine Gael failed to do while in government and, as it sickens me to look at it, I will not go through it again.Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have overseen the recruitment of 11,000 extra gardaí since 1997 and 12,023 extra prison places have been provided. The Garda budget has increased by 60%, from just over €600 million to €960 million this year and it will be over €1 billion next year. An unprecedented volume of criminal law reform has been introduced, as the members of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights fully realise.We cannot be complacent. We must continue to work. I welcome the Minister's commitment to increase the Garda force to 12,200 by the end of 2004. I also welcome the fact that €38 million has been provided for prison capital projects this year and I commend the Minister for introducing the new public order and intoxicating liquor legislation, which has enhanced the power of the Garda to deal with public order offences. A new Garda Powers Bill will be introduced shortly, giving substantial additional powers to the Garda. In every way the Minister has worked effectively to improve the power and capacity of the Garda.The problem of gangland murders must be solved. The Minister and the committed gardaí are in place to do that.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	983	I am always happy to speak on a Private Members' motion. On this occasion I commend my colleagues from Fine Gael, and particularly Deputy Deasy, for giving us an opportunity to debate this issue and to applaud the work of the Garda Síochána, which we should do at every opportunity.I am looking forward to supporting the Government's amendment in this evening's vote. The amendment makes reference to the Minister condemning the despicable action of those criminals who last week placed a hoax bomb under the car of a journalist who lives in my constituency.  This was a disgraceful act. I join the Minister in congratulating the gardaí on their prompt action in discovering and dealing with the crime. I commend the Garda for dealing in a sensitive way with my constituents who were discommoded and had to be looked after in a local secondary school.On occasions such as this political lines are drawn and political points are made. In a democracy that is fair enough. However, it is important that we remain focused on this issue. Since I became a Deputy and found myself lucky enough to be assigned to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, under the able chairmanship of Deputy Ardagh, I have learnt an enormous amount about the criminal justice system and the manner in which people's concerns can be dealt with. We should not be afraid to say that.I am never afraid to mention my own constituency. Tallaght, despite the fact that it is the third largest population centre in the country, is a very safe place. In the last two days I have been upset to hear a negative image of The Square in Tallaght projected on the national airwaves, as far as crime is concerned. I am defensive about Tallaght and Dublin South-West. In a major population centre one will always have problems of crime and vandalism. I do not believe Tallaght is worse than anywhere else in that regard.It is important that we support those people in our community who are fighting against lawlessness. We must support the Garda but also those community workers who take on tasks on drugs rehabilitation programmes, Garda diversion programmes and all the community activities that are so important in every community. I merely highlight my own community.I do not wish to ambush the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but remind him that there is an application with his Department regarding the STAY project in Scoil Íosa in Tymon north in Tallaght, which I commend to him. In considering how to deal with crime and the effects of crime we must continue to make funds available for the tremendous work being done by many diversionary projects. The project in Tymon north is worth supporting.I also commend the section of the amendment which refers to community responses to crime. I am thinking, particularly, of what the Minister told us about the RAPID programme. There has been some criticism of this programme. However, I am glad the publication of the Book of Estimates shows that the Government continues to support his programme. I welcome this support on behalf of Dublin South-West.

Nevertheless, the events that led to the collapse of the trial were a wake up call. They show the contempt some sections of our society have for the criminal justice system. We witnessed thugs, young and old, who act in the pursuit of financial gain and in defending those ill-gotten gains. The fact that in the process they destroy individual lives and degrade the quality of life in communities is a matter of no importance to them. Their main route to riches lies in trafficking in illegal drugs and they will not allow anyone or anything to stand in their way, not even their former accomplices.One of the most powerful tools we have in fighting this scourge is the Criminal Assets Bureau. There are those on the Opposition benches who would assert that it was they who established the bureau in response to the organised crime crisis in 1996. It was the Proceeds of Crime Bill, introduced by the last Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a Private Members' Bill from the Opposition benches and accepted by the rainbow Government that provided the basis for the Act establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau.

Organised crime makes huge profits on the backs of the unfortunate people who misuse drugs. To help tackle the problem, the Government has established local drugs task forces in areas experiencing the worst of drugs misuse. They involve local communities working with State agencies and voluntary organisations, ensure a fully integrated response to the drugs problem and are the central vehicle for the active participation of the community and voluntary sector working in conjunction with State agencies responding on the ground to the problem presented on the ground. All involved agree that the task forces play a key role in improving the situation on the ground. The Government has established regional drugs task forces in the regional health board areas. Most of them are now up and running successfully.Organised crime is, more and more, becoming a multinational phenomenon. When crime and criminals cross borders, tackling that criminality can become quite complicated. We are too well aware of how Irish criminals are active in other countries. We have heard that organised crime knows no borders. Our experience suggests that organised criminals know borders only too well and how to exploit them to facilitate their activities. They have traditionally exploited the practical problem borders present for law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice systems, which tend to apply to specific jurisdictions.These problems have been recognised at EU and at UN levels. As a result, steps have been taken to provide a legal framework in which law enforcement agencies can be given the tools to tackle cross-border crime properly. Examples within the European Union are the European arrest warrant and the new EU framework for joint investigative teams. These represent a practical recognition of the need for countries sharing the same problems to work together. They are not just exclusive to Ireland.The UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime commits governments to a range of measures to facilitate effective combating of organised crime. Ireland will ratify this convention shortly. It contains strong provisions, specifically in the areas of combating money laundering and, significantly, denying criminal groups access to legal businesses and markets. This last action is seen as a key strategy for preventing organised crime. Ireland is fully involved in these and other initiatives in the fight against gangs and organised crime.In the face of the most radical overhaul of the criminal justice system since the foundation of the State, all we have heard from the Opposition is a set of superficially attractive and frequently unworkable solutions. It has spoken loosely about 40 or so gangs operating in the country. If we are to debate crime seriously, we need better information than this. The actual number of organised criminal groups is determined each year using the EU definition of organised crime, as in the EU  situation report on organised crime. It is important to note that the most recently completed situation report identified 17 major organised crime groups in Ireland, about half of which operate in Dublin. More than 12 of these were investigated in 2002. This process is continuing this year and will continue in 2004 and thereafter until completed.The Fine Gael motion criticises the Government's implementation of the RAPID programme, which targets the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. I reject the contention that gangs and organised crime are in any way caused by social deprivation. Gang members are criminals, intent on becoming extremely wealthy by trafficking in people or by exploiting human misery in all its forms, especially those who abuse drugs.The Government amendment to the motion states that the Government continues to be committed to the RAPID programme. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been active in its implementation and co-ordination. Since the establishment of the programme, the Department has provided approximately €3 million by way of support to the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans and administration costs. The RAPID programme can contribute significantly towards tackling disadvantage in urban areas and large towns. A provision of €5.8 million in the 2004 budget to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the programme indicates the ongoing commitment of the Government to RAPID.The Government recognises the importance of supporting and developing disadvantaged communities. The announcement earlier this month that a significant amount of the disbursements from the dormant accounts fund will be directed towards projects in areas designated by Government as suffering particular disadvantage is a significant boost for RAPID areas.The attacks in the motion before the House have no validity. The Government's amendment sets out the true position. The Government has the matter under control, contrary to what those in the Opposition benches and others would like to portray. The fundamentals of our criminal justice system are sound. The adequacy of legislative provisions and resources allocated are under review.A total of 55,000 extra hours were allocated in Garda overtime and were laughed at in the House. This number of hours, which accrued over a six week period, is significant. Garda numbers will continue to grow. The Garda budget for 2004 shows an increase of 10% on that of 2003. No one could suggest that this is not a significant increase. The specialist agencies of the Garda are working efficiently and effectively and our courts and prisons are well-resourced and doing their jobs.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law  Reform comprehensively addressed many of the specific issues raised by Opposition Members last night. Not only does the Government remain prepared to stand over its record of achievement in office and be judged on that, it also laid bare through the Minister last night the empty rhetoric of many members of the Opposition who seek to criticise it for the sake of doing so.It is a fact that there is no magic solution to crime problems in Ireland or elsewhere, and this is why the Government has since 1997 engaged in a thorough and sustained campaign of reform and reorganisation of the criminal justice system. The Garda Síochána Bill under preparation represents the first major reform of the Garda since its inception. It offers Deputies from both sides of the House the opportunity to shape the nature of policing for decades to come. I hope the opportunity is used wisely by way of meaningful debate and discussion rather than as an opportunity to undermine the public perception of the force, as has happened recently.Independent agencies have been established and allocated the necessary resources to run the courts and prisons effectively. The Minister is proceeding with a major reorganisation of the court system and, in particular, a reform of the criminal courts as recommended in Mr. Justice Fennelly's report.The Opposition should not fail to condemn those who use violence and intimidation in pursuit of amassing illegal gains and those who are responsible for the deployment of huge resources that could be used more productively elsewhere. In light of what I have said and what the Minister said yesterday, I have no hesitation in commending the amendment to the motion to the House.

However, the motion is too simplistic and the Government response is self-congratulatory. The issues deserve better treatment. I agree with parts of the motion, especially the statement that the Government has failed to support the RAPID programme properly and to initiate measures to tackle social disadvantage. It has definitely exacerbated the crime problem. The RAPID programme is the slowest Government programme to date.The Government has a responsibility to invest in crime reduction and I am greatly disappointed that the Estimates do not reflect this. Crime prevention measures have been cut back for the second year in a row. I take issue with the Minister's statement that the Government has allocated significant resources, amounting to €68  million, to initiatives to combat the drugs problem. This is almost the same amount the Government spent on the horse and greyhound racing fund this year. The Minister stated the Government had made a significant increase of 5% in spending on young people's services and facilities. Again, this is the same increase that has been proposed for the horse and greyhound racing fund. Therefore, the Government is sending out the message that it considers horses and dogs to be just as important as tackling the drugs problem and crime. This is a disgrace.In my advice clinics, especially in working class areas, I am inundated by calls from parents and the elderly who believe their communities have been abandoned by the Garda and the State. Alienation from the Garda is increasing. The Government will have to face this problem, as may its successor.I welcome the decision by the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to review current practice in other jurisdictions as well as the resourcing, operational and administrative issues related to policing and the court system. This is the responsible way to address the relevant issues. I echo Deputy Ardagh's call for the public to play a role in addressing submissions to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.An effective and accountable policing service is necessary. The policing service in this State needs much more than increased funding and more gardaí, it needs to review how resources are deployed and whether this deployment meets local needs. Fundamental reform is required to make the service more locally accountable to the communities it serves. I disagree with the Minister's assertion yesterday that the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner alone. If we want to restore community confidence, trust and support for the Garda Síochána, we must have greater transparency and accountability at local level with regard to deployment decisions.As regards the Fine Gael Party motion, Sinn Féin cannot support the extended use of the Special Criminal Court.

I agree with the Minister's assertion that the response to the crime problem must be resolute, proportional and focused, and that criminal justice in this State must strike a balance between punishing wrongdoers and protecting personal liberties and fundamental rights. I welcome his belief that a jury trial is one of the chief guarantors against oppressive misuse of State authority and one of the principal foundations of public confidence in the justice system. The dissolution of the Special Criminal  Court is the only possible conclusion based on this logic.

I was delighted when he was appointed to the job as I believed he would be a Minister with strong views who would come forward with strong proposals that would make a real difference and give a sense of worth to law-abiding citizens, but it gives me no joy to place on the record my grave disappointment with his performance to date.The stark reality is that the criminals have put it up to the Minister and he has funked it. When criminals gave him two fingers, his response was to further undermine his standing and reputation by engaging in personal and insulting attacks on Members of the House, attacking journalists and the media and making comments to undermine the Garda Síochána. The Minister has highlighted his inability to deal with the matter by asking everybody else to come forward with proposals. He needs to realise that he is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a Department and the full resources of the State behind him, and it is his job to make proposals, address the chronic position in which we find ourselves and ensure that ordinary law-abiding citizens can live in relative safety without fear for their lives and intimidation and without elderly people living in fear in their own homes. What is needed is determination to treat the troublemakers with the full rigours of the law by ensuring they are dealt with rapidly and harshly by the courts and stiff sentences are handed down and served in full. In summary, the Minister must take a no nonsense approach.The truth is that much of the law breaking is being carried out by the same people time and again. They are self-styled hard chaws who have developed reputations, treat the Garda, courts and legal system with contempt and use the courts and environs as their stage for entertainment shows. When they use their appearances in court to enhance their reputation as hard men, the system facilitates it and they are accommodated and tolerated. They get away to have another laugh, brag with their mates and give two fingers to the institutions of the State and organised society. It is the Minister's duty to stop being in denial and get on with his job.

The Fine Gael Party is correct to table this motion. It is obvious that where there is disadvantage, certain people will become involved in criminality. The terrible pity is that areas have been ghettoised through a lack of recreational facilities and employment opportunities and it is sad that young people who could otherwise be involved in worthwhile activity end up getting involved in crime. Successive Governments must share the blame for this.There is a great saying that prevention is better than cure. The answer must be to fight disadvantage in the first instance and provide the necessary recreational facilities and educational and employment opportunities. As I stated on previous occasions, we should create a special category to keep people on FÁS schemes in employment. This would have important benefits in terms of their self-esteem and would be well worth the additional expense to the Exchequer of €20 to €30 per week.We have a job to do in addressing crime and must deal with criminals adequately and severely. Crime appears to be a soft touch as criminals would not commit crime unless it paid. The message must go out that it no longer pays, which cannot happen until criminals get caught. Those with knowledge of this issue tell us that a small number of hardened criminals are involved in crime. This group should be targeted, put under a microscope, harassed in every possible way using every available resource and dealt with. What happened to Paul Williams was utterly despicable. People who speak out should be supported.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1002	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to this motion on crime. In recent weeks we have seen an escalation in gangland violence and a major threat to the administration of justice. The shootings and killings have focused attention on a problem we have all known about for many years. It is essential that our response, as legislators, is thoughtful and considerate. I do not agree with those who argue that civil liberties must go out the window when one is dealing with crime. We need to deal with the causes of crime, have effective policing strategies and stand up to the bullies who are destroying our communities. To ignore disadvantaged communities and dysfunctional and violent children and teenagers is simply to walk away from the real solution to our crime problem.We must also question and examine the management of Garda resources and target the small minority of extremely violent criminals. Crime prevention and public safety must be top of the agenda, otherwise we are codding ourselves and letting down the victims of crime. This debate should be about prevention measures, making the justice system work and making it fair, effective and relevant for our citizens.Dismay and disillusionment with the way we tackle crime is widespread in society. I urge the Minister to listen to the sensible voices in our communities and those on the ground who deal with crime. In the next few weeks we will listen to and raise these ideas in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I would appreciate if the Minister would take these ideas on board.I strongly support the position that we should not rip up the Constitution when tackling crime. There is no case for new Garda powers. Eroding civil liberties still further should not be an option.  Throwing tantrums in the House about law and order will not help the victims. Those who argue that changes in the law are the solution are utterly cynical. The way forward is to tackle social and economic disadvantage, bring back the mockeys, use CAB more often and make policing more effective.

The criminals will not be at home tomorrow perusing the newspapers or watching "Oireachtas Report" to see what will happen or how their lives will pan out. The only major worry they have is getting caught. There is no need to introduce new laws to tackle the problem. What is required is the enforcement of the laws on the Statute Book and greater vigilance.A significant increase in resources is also required. We have heard a great deal about the scarcity of resources.During the election campaign 18 months ago we heard a great deal about the 2,000 extra gardaí. I do not believe this can ever become a reality. It takes approximately 14 months to train 675 new gardaí and this is followed by a two year probationary period. At the same time, however, 57 year old gardaí are compelled to retire from the force. These gardaí are at the peak of their careers. They have accumulated a vast amount of experience and knowledge, the type of knowledge one will not find in a book. This priceless jewel is being forced on to the retirement scrap heap. It is insane to allow this to continue.A number of reports recommend that the compulsory retirement age should be increased to 60 years. There is no reason that it should not be increased to 62 or 63 years. We are wasting valuable resources. There is also the problem that gardaí who reach the age of 50 years can voluntarily retire. This means that a person can spend more time in retirement than doing the job. It costs money because a half salary must be paid to everyone who is allowed to slip through the system. The only way to build up the force is to stop the gardaí leaving the force.The cause of this debate is the situation in Limerick, which has become a flashpoint. Part of the reason is that since 1980 the number of gardaí in Limerick has been halved. In the last seven years there have been approximately 40 murders and the gardaí are to be complimented on the fact that they have charged people in 35 of those cases. It is a fair compliment for a force coming under such pressure.The gardaí know the criminal gangs. They must target the members of these gangs and throw a ring of steel around them. They must put them under surveillance, learn their habits and get to know the people with whom they associate. That is how they will tackle them.

I will then discuss Garda numbers and the wider causes of crime in society.The letter is as follows:I was sitting here this morning writing up my journal and I thought, where is this going to get me? What we need is some action and support.I did not know whether to contact the Minister for families and children, the Minister for health, or the Minister for justice. I live in Swords. I know you are very familiar with it. Are you aware that the majority of teenagers in Swords (and everywhere, I am sure you have read the reports, seen the Prime Time programmes) are drinking and smoking cannabis? Are you aware that sixteen and seventeen year olds are able to get crates of beer from the off licences, without being asked for I.D.? Are you aware that it's easier get cannabis in Swords than cigarettes?It's out of control of the parents Taoiseach, but most of all it's out of your control. You have some good people in your Dept. Mr. Martin and Seamus Brennan jump to mind, in tackling the pubs and the carnage on our roads but you need to tackle this. I urge you now Taoiseach, before it's too late (if it's not already too late).We have children having babies. We have children (because that's all they are) killing each other over mobile phones (Laois and Coolock to mention but two). I am a mother of two teenagers. I have never worked outside the home since they were born, and believe me Taoiseach I don't know what the answer is. But I know this much, it could be any of our sons out there doing these evil things, because the drink and drugs are out of control.Do something now Taoiseach.That letter is from a constituent of my party leader, Deputy Sargent. It sums up the concerns parents have about crime and their children.There was an increase in Garda numbers last year and there will be an increase this year. However, that increase is less than the increase in any of the previous five years. In other words, the rate of increase is slowing substantially. At the same time, the population has increased dramatically. The number of gardaí per thousand people has decreased. We have fewer gardaí per head of population than four years ago. There are not enough gardaí and that is a part of the problem that must be addressed. I am not convinced we are getting the number of recruits required.However, we need to do more than recruit gardaí at entrance level. The Garda Síochána should be recruiting people at senior levels and benefiting from the resources and expertise people have gathered from years in the private sector and, perhaps, from time spent abroad. We should also encourage people from the UK and the US who are familiar with modern crime tackling techniques to join the force.There is more involved in this problem than  increasing the number of gardaí, giving them better training and recruiting better gardaí in the first place. We must look at what we are doing when we build communities. New homes are being built many miles from the nearest bus stop and shop and without sports facilities or playgrounds. If we are to prevent an increase in criminality in the years to come, we must build good communities in the first instance. The recent increase in gangland criminality proves that. If attention is not paid to creating good communities in the first place, there will be an increase in crime.At present, we are sowing the seeds of future criminality but we can stop it by doing a few simple things. We need to build good, mixed use communities with the facilities needed to encourage people to participate in civil society. That covers everything from providing a playgroup to child care to ensuring that community employment schemes are not cut back. We must also ensure that the resources are available. The gardaí must be in these communities in the first instance and be given the right tools to tackle problems.Fighting gangland criminality is making the headlines but it is a more difficult task to address the root causes of crime by building decent communities. Resources must be devoted to those areas if criminality in Irish society is to be tackled.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	I thank my colleague, Deputy Deasy, for giving us the opportunity to debate this important matter. Three quarters of all prisoners in Mountjoy Prison come from approximately five identifiable areas in Dublin. There are no prizes for guessing the areas and I will not stigmatise them by naming them. However, I am not talking about Ballsbridge, Foxrock, Castleknock or Malahide.I make no excuse for prisoners. The people in prison deserve to be there. However, if we, as public representatives and legislators who are charged with the control of the public purse and with protecting the common good, do not address the causes of crime, we will contribute to a recurring phenomenon. If we know that five areas of Dublin produce so many convicted criminals, why do we not try an area based approach to deal with the causes of crime?Research shows that a child who grows up in a family without a father present is 22 times more likely to commit a crime than someone who grows up with their father present. This research was carried out in Wisconsin, the only US State which compiles research in this manner. This is not to take from the heroic efforts of single parents. Indeed, I grew up in a single parent home and I salute the many single parents who prevent their children getting involved in crime. However, if one happens to be a single mother living in one of the five areas I mentioned, she faces tremendous odds regardless of how good a parent she is. This is an issue we should address. How can we  assist the struggling parents who are doing their best?As Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for local development, I designated the additional 24 areas which increased from 11 pilot areas to 35 the number of area based partnership boards. The objective of these boards is to treat the causes of disadvantage. Some have discharged their responsibilities well and some not so well but the idea is good. In Dublin, the drugs task forces have been based on the same geographical boundaries. Within those boundaries there has been an attempt to create policing forums. However, these are hit and miss affairs. In the Rialto policing forum, attempts to secure the services of an administrator who might follow up issues in between meetings involving the Garda, Dublin City Council, the local community and public representatives have failed. If these area policing forums were expanded, especially in the five identifiable areas to which I referred, to include the educational and health authorities, they could be made to deliver a co-ordinated response to the needs of the community.Meetings as they stand are useful because at least they help to keep communications open. However, these forums are not effective across the board and they could become more targeted and effective with a little effort, some planning and much determination. Such forums could regularly be thrown open to the local community in parish hearings where people would be regularly invited to attend and voice their opinions to those paid to deliver services. With follow-up meetings occasionally, there could be a measurable response to the needs of the community.Recidivism is a major problem and sometimes prisons seem like centres for recycling offenders. I do not know what the international best practice is in regard to penal reform, but could an Ireland which experienced the Celtic tiger not have put more effort into prison reform? Recidivists form a sub-culture in society. They are constantly excluded when in prison and stay part of that sub-culture when they leave.The Minister said that the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights is to hold hearings on the needs of the criminal justice system if it is to be effective. I look forward to these hearings, which I hope are not a continuation of some form of public relations exercise, and to the plans on reform of the system. Simply proposing more laws will not do.Over the years the response to criminal activity has been to promise more laws. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform boasted that they have passed a law per year for the past 40 years. That is correct. In fact, we have passed 40 criminal justice Acts since 1973 and the Minister in his opening statement last night proposed a further criminal justice Act early in the new year. If all this law were put  before the Dáil in one, four or five Acts, alarm bells would ring and we would question whether all this law was needed.At present, gardaí can obtain from Eircom the details of phone calls made by TDs and journalists and without a court order or anyone knowing. Gardaí have been given extensive powers. I am prepared to contemplate giving them additional powers if necessary, but when do we ever rescind law which is bad or not working? All law and no order is no way to run a criminal justice system. What we have is all law and no order.In his speech last night the Minister stated:The Garda Commissioner has informed me today that in the 12 month period November 2002 to the end of October 2003, public order offences have sharply declined by 9% and violent assaults are down by more than 14%.With no disrespect to the Garda Commissioner or anyone else, how can we measure the effectiveness of the Garda or the need for resources without an independent assessment of the true level of crime and the effectiveness of remedies? Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi will not suffice. If we cannot measure the level of crime we cannot combat it. Our refusal to measure the level of crime and deal with it is at the heart of the failure of the criminal justice system.I contrast the way the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does his business – a word with the Commissioner which the Minister jots down and trots out in the House as if it were gospel – with how the issue was dealt with in another jurisdiction, New York, for example, under the leadership of the former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. The centrepiece of the efforts in New York was a process called Compstat. I want to spend some time elaborating on this issue because we can all throw around allegations in the House. I will put forward a proposal that I want examined. Many of these problems could be tackled if we had a hands-on Minister in the way the former mayor, Mr. Giuliani, was hands-on in New York instead of a part-time Minister who is also President of the Progressive Democrats and who promises Minister of State jobs to anyone who will run for them.Compstat combined two techniques, neither of which had been previously implemented. First, crime statistics were collected and analysed each day to recognise patterns and potentially troublesome behaviour before it spread. At the Compstat meetings the data was used to hold each borough command responsible. Some 100 policemen at a time, from top brass to officers, joined by others from throughout the criminal justice system would be convened in a big room in which each command's statistics faced scrutiny.According to the former mayor, Mr. Giuliani, in his book, Leadership, they next set about determining who bought into the idea of accountability and who did not. Bureaucracies sometimes resisted change because they thought large ships could not be turned around. In the view of the  mayor, even the largest organisations comprised people who either bought into Compstat or were told to find another line of work.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1007	Even in a highly unionised workforce like the New York Police Department, he found that there was plenty of leverage available. According to his own account, anyone above the rank of captain, deputy inspector, inspector, assistant chief, deputy chief, bureau chief and chief of the department could be demoted. This was not just a knock to morale but to their pensions as well. Those below the management ranks could be re-assigned. A police officer who lived in Westchester might find himself or herself stationed in Staten Island. Any manager who did not have their heart in the new system was made to understand that it was time to retire or face demotion. Those in the force who realised that Compstat would not only improve their city but also make their jobs more rewarding were promoted and entrusted with leadership roles.At the same time, they set their sights on clarifying the purpose of the police department and crafting indicators to show whether goals were being met. This is again a case of accountability. As the former mayor, Mr. Giuliani, pointed out, crimes occur for a daunting and complex set of reasons, sometimes for no reason at all. It is simply not possible to predict where and when every crime will occur, but to try one must at least know what is going on.In New York for years, the statistics in the police department that drew the most attention were the number of arrests and the reaction time to emergency calls. In fact, they found neither public safety nor reducing crime is the ultimate goal of a police force. Usually, a crime had already occurred by the time 911 was dialled. If an arrest took place, that only put a dent in future crime the perpetrator might have committed rather than protecting the immediate victim. Furthermore, they found that they needed reliable data. Arrest numbers, for example, were susceptible to manipulation.They knew they had to come up with criteria apart from arrests and response times. Each year for all the cities in America with populations in excess of 100,000 the FBI reported the number of crimes in each of seven categories – murder, rape, robbery, felonious assaults, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto. The main frustration with the state of policing was that each set of statistics was obsolete by the time it was available. Examining the numbers annually or even quarterly did not accomplish anything in real time. By the time a pattern of crime was noticed it would have changed. When the statistics finally came in, even for huge numbers of crimes, they did not reflect the actual volume.The reason was simple. For a crime to register,  someone had to report it or the police had to find out about it. Statistics covered only the crimes the police knew had occurred. Also in New York it was found that, as crime escalates, a smaller percentage of it is reported because a victim must have confidence that the authorities can and will respond in an effective way.When people were first told that they could access statistics on a daily basis, they thought it was an exaggeration. Most of them smiled like the Ministers opposite are smiling now. No police department anywhere was gathering data with that frequency. It was thought it would take two or three years to implement the system. It was an ambitious goal at the time, but the first statistics began to arrive within three weeks.According to Giuliani it works this way. The police officer in the street makes a report and enters it into his precinct's on-line complaints system. The report is transmitted to the Compstat mainframe and entered into two places: on a map that shows geographical concentrations of criminal activity and sorts them by hour of day, type of crime, and day and week; and on a weekly summary of crime complaints that displays trends over a variety of periods, such as a week to date, month to date, and year to date, and compares the current year's total with the prior year and percentage changes.The data can only result in a meaningful response if it is accurate. They implemented an auditing system. This system would flag statistically unrealistic performance, allowing them to dig deeper into its accuracy. There were even commanders removed for tinkering with the numbers. At their management meetings, they could ask questions such as, "Why are car thefts down 20% citywide, but up 10% in your area?" or "Explain why assaults have been falling for six straight months until last month, then started rising."They made it difficult for evasion by requiring that precinct commanders' entire staff be present. In this way those who performed well could be recognised; those who under-performed could also be recognised. The resources they had were used to tackle specific crime in areas of greatest need. Where is the comparable accountability on crime measurement in the Irish policing system?The Minister made much in his opening comments about Opposition criticism last night. Is what I have said fair and reasonable or is it abusive? Is what I have said something that should be studied? Do not let any Member say I do not have the right to raise these questions. Not only have I an absolute right but I have a duty to do so. We cannot tackle what we cannot measure.There needs to be a root and branch reform of the Garda Síochána which includes accountability, reward for effort, praise for those who make the effort and criticism for those who do not pull their weight. It is a long time now since I published a Bill seeking the creation of a bureau for crime statistics which would be independent. Perhaps the Minister would take a leaf out of  Giuliani's book and give some leadership on this issue. There is a need for measurement and accountability.I have not spent a good part of my speech on this issue for no reason. I have thought about this and have put forward proposals which I ask the Minister to take on board. Giuliani turned around New York and the police force did not suffer. Those who worked got greater reward. For those in the Garda force of some 10,000 people there are some stumers but most of them are good people. The good should be rewarded and the stumours weeded out. The Minister cannot do that by coming telling the House the Garda Commissioner told him on his way in that crime had gone down by 14%. That will not wash. Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean leí will not do any more. We need a professional measurement of the position and accountability. We need some way of measuring what is being done with the resources provided by this House.I do not have the exact figures to hand, but I know from a previous parliamentary question that the number of judges in the last 40 years has either tripled or quadrupled. Unlike Deputies, judges do not have to stand for election and are permanent and pensionable. When they take recesses, unlike Deputies, by and large they take a break. I am all for benchmarking of Deputies and I would have no difficulty with some group being set up to review our work practices and how we allocate our time between the Dáil, committees, the constituency, the party and such like.It is time some independent body monitored the work rate of judges and set out some measure of how it is expected they should earn their salaries. If they are to get benchmarking pay increases like everyone else in the public service, they should be asked to give something in return.I see no mention of this in any of the Minister's utterances about reform of the Judiciary. Furthermore, I am very nervous about any suggestions coming from the Minister in that regard. I am sorry if what I have to say provokes him, but perhaps we need to have some provocation here. The Minister is an insider when it comes to his dealings with his friends and colleagues in the courts. Any suggestion that the constitutional right of the Oireachtas to remove a judge should in any way be subject to a recommendation from a group of judges, or any attempt to water down the independence of the Oireachtas in that regard, should be resisted tooth and nail.Let us see some real reform of the Judiciary. Let us see some accountability for the salaries they are paid, especially in terms of hours worked. Being independent is one thing, being accountable is different. We do not have to interfere with the independence of judges in discharging their responsibilities to require them to be more accountable for the salaries they receive.It is time to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out some independent review of the fees being charged to the State for various  functions discharged by lawyers. To put it mildly, we are not getting anything like value for money and many millions could be saved. If that money could be diverted to the fight against crime, or better still to the fight against the causes of crime, all the better.It gives me no pleasure to raise this matter but I feel a duty to do so. Twice in the past month Vincent Browne wrote in The Sunday Business Post that gardaí routinely perjure themselves. I was appalled to read this, but I was even more appalled not to see any refutation either by the Minister for Justice or the Garda Commissioner. Perhaps there was a refutation and I missed it. I want the Minister to respond to Vincent Browne tonight when he replies to this debate. Is what Mr. Browne said true or untrue? If it is true, we have a serious matter on our hands which goes right to the heart of the training of the Garda about the gravity of such an offence. If it is not true, it should not be allowed stand. Twice in the past month, Vincent Browne made that statement and I ask the Minister either to contradict him or clarify what he had to say. One way or the other, that statement should not be allowed stand. It is far too serious an allegation not to be raised in this House and it needs to be addressed.I ask the Minister to tell the House how regularly an independent assessment of the method of training of gardaí is carried out and where these reports go. Surely it is time to have more regular evaluation of the training of gardaí which can be made public and which then can be made available to Deputies and others who make policy so that Garda training keeps abreast of best international practice.I am pleased the Minister is present to hear I was very disappointed with his contribution last night. A Minister who has much ability and showed a great deal of promise made a bad and testy speech. It was made almost in the way it was typed. It was awkward and had nothing positive to contribute to the debate. The Minister should give more serious and considered attention to issues of this kind when they are raised here.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1008	I thank Deputy Mitchell for drawing to my attention and the attention of the Minister the comments made by Vincent Browne. Of course, I entirely refute the suggestion that gardaí have habitually or routinely perjured themselves. I am pleased the Deputy has extended to me an opportunity to put that on the record. It is a most improper and outrageous suggestion. The Deputy will appreciate that Ministers in Government see their duty as performing their duties and not chasing every story in print. Were we to occupy ourselves with such matters there would not be much time left to perform our duties. I refute entirely that suggestion. It was, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, quite improper of any commentator to suggest that the Garda routinely perjure themselves in the courts.Deputy Gay Mitchell's contribution was of interest to me. In some respects it was constructive but it was at variance with the tone of the motion tabled by his party. One of the crucial paragraphs in that motion is the one which suggests Dáil Éireann, "believing that the failure of the Government to properly support the RAPID Programme [a proposition which is debatable] in order to tackle the roots of social disadvantage has exacerbated the crime problem."  Does anyone seriously believe that? Would Fine Gael have put forward such a motion in the time of Liam Cosgrave or any other leader the party has had since?In the intercensal period for which we have the records, 1996-2002, some 386,000 additional jobs were created here, many in the areas once characterised as disadvantaged. The best social programme is a job. Several Opposition Members, not confined to Fine Gael, gave us extended lectures on social philosophy this evening. We all know the fundamental problem is that the increase in employment has thrown into relief a particularly nasty group of individuals who are posing a very serious problem to the criminal justice system. We face a challenge but let us not relate it to talk about a RAPID programme because the persons engaging in these vile activities are not interested in RAPID programmes, recreational facilities or such matters. Of course we have to tackle the roots of delinquency which are many and varied, depending on the type of crime involved. The recent collapse of the Central Criminal Court trial sitting in Limerick was a serious matter, and the development of a gangland culture, not alone in Limerick but in the inner city and suburban parts of Dublin, is also very serious. These matters must be tackled.The Minister has a good record this year. He has secured a significant increase in the Garda Vote for next year, €91 million, a 10% increase, well ahead of the rate of inflation. I was interested in Deputy Mitchell's comments on the experience in New York but it is not easy to transplant the cultural experience of other countries to this jurisdiction. The Deputy did not include in the motion the suggestion that gardaí should be demoted on performance grounds or have their pensions docked on a similar basis.

That element of accountability is not missing. I am driven to conclude that the accountability which Deputy Mitchell wants to introduce is that of demotion and docking pensions. If the Opposition wants to put that forward as a serious proposition it should  do so and debate it instead of piggybacking it on another motion.The motion is a scattergun approach to the issues about which we are all concerned. The Minister has secured additional funding and he will bring the force up to its maximum authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. He has managed his budgetary resources well enough this year to ensure that he has €2 million to target the matters which he has to target and he has tackled the issue of prison overtime. I hope the Opposition will support us on that in the weeks ahead because if savings are effected on prison overtime and if we can effect a permanent change in the culture of prison management, more resources will be available for the Garda Síochána to pay for overtime and to assist and reassure the public, as I want to do, that the Government is determined to tackle this problem.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was appointed I thought he would be very good, through his family background he would understand the importance of the job to which he was appointed, by profession, particularly as a prosecution lawyer, he would have seen the problems close up and as Attorney General he would have gained a good insight into the policy position and the policies that were required. His political experience would have given him the astuteness to be able to deal with the issues and mobilise the forces at his disposal in the criminal justice system. I hold a different view now. The Minister has failed the test at the first serious challenge to his authority. The drugs trade, the gun trade and the murder trade are now out of control and criminal gangs are literally and metaphorically giving the two fingers to the criminal justice system.The Minister's defence seems to be that there is no real crisis, that we are seeing a rise on the graphs, but to take serious action would do violence to the Constitution. It is possible to quote from different sections of the Constitution but I will quote from Article 40.2 on the personal rights of individuals: "The State shall. in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen."  This year there have been 19 gangland murders, 15 in Dublin and four in Limerick.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1028	That is what I am doing. Intimidation is widespread in Limerick. I have given two examples. The third example is a murder case in which the person who was working as a doorman at a particular club was scheduled to appear in court as a witness to a minor offence. The gardaí in Limerick believe that he was murdered because his evidence for a minor offence would have triggered the lifting of a suspended sentence on a serious criminal. The office of the State solicitor in Limerick has been petrol-bombed. The house of a junior counsel who is a State pros ecutor in Limerick has been set on fire. The offices of a State solicitor in the county have been burgled and a prosecution file stolen. Yet the Minister tells me that there is no crisis in the criminal justice system.There have been four murders in Limerick since the beginning of the year. Most of the gangland murders are in Dublin and there seems to be no interest in what is happening in Dublin. The cases are not proceeding to court because the intimidation in gangland Dublin and in the communities affected is as strong as in Limerick. There is a challenge to the criminal justice system and an iron fist is required to deal with it, but the Minister has failed in that.Ministers are frequently challenged. In the 1970s the Provisional IRA posed a challenge to which Pat Cooney and Desmond O'Malley rose. In the 1980s the Provisional IRA was still active and launched a campaign in the Republic. It challenged the State and those of us who were in power at the time rose to the challenge. In the 1990s when criminal gangs challenged the State and the outrageous murder of Veronica Guerin challenged the right of the media to comment, Nora Owen and the Government rose to the challenge.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is being challenged now and is bottling out. It is not about reform of the law and not about special courts. It is not about anything but the leadership coming from the Minister's office which is needed to give the Garda the resources it needs to deploy the gardaí properly and to take on the gangs.The State has to win these challenges. The Minister is not even rising to the challenge at the moment, and if he lets it slide, gangs that are now becoming strong because of the availability of money from drugs and of guns coming from the Continent through the UK will strengthen to the point that the Minister's successors will find it extremely difficult to deal with the situation at all.I know there are social causes for crime, and we could all talk about them, but the crisis we face now must be dealt with now. Other issues must be dealt with in parallel or subsequently, but as in the past when the challenge came from subversives or criminals, the Minister of the day must lead the counter attack. The challenge must be met and faced down, and all the resources of the State must be used to face it down.In all sincerity, and I am not making false complimentary comments, there are many people like me around the country who are disappointed in the Minister's leadership at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They had great expectations that he would be very effective, and he is not.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1029	I thank my Fine Gael colleague who participated in this debate. We got a real insight tonight into the delusional fantasy world of the Progressive Democrats. A Member of this  House actually questioned any link between social deprivation and the levels of crime in some areas. That was unbelievable. It shows the sort of ivory tower the Progressive Democrats live in.One of the most noticeable or striking aspects of the speech last night by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was his attempt to attach blame for the lowering of morale in the Garda Síochána to the Opposition spokespeople. He said that the Garda has for the last 18 months been under a constant bombardment of morale-sapping criticism from the Opposition parties in this House, and that week in, week out, Opposition Members accuse members of the Garda of impropriety and misbehaviour. That is a real indication of how worried the Minister is about the extent of the damage done to his relationship with the Garda. It is a clear indication that he has managed to put himself under immense pressure because of the really incredible things he has said about the Garda.I will give a sample of what gardaí are saying. Last weekend a retired inspector said that the Minister has lost the respect of the force with his insidious slur that gardaí were taking bribes, that he had greatly offended the entire force with that slur, that morale in the force was shattered, and that the blame lay to a great extent with the Minister. Regarding the allegations about journalists bribing gardaí, the GRA said that the issue has done untold damage to the force and has blackened it.Gardaí have come to the conclusion that the Minister likes listening to his own voice and has grown very fond of the sound of it. The GRA said that the Minster gets almost ecstatic at the very idea of a microphone or a camera being  pointed in his direction. That is what the gardaí think of him.The Minister said statistics reveal that violent crimes against the person fell consistently during the first nine months of this year. Yesterday we got the SAVI report, a report commissioned by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. It showed that 21,000 women are victims of sexual assault each year and that a woman is raped in this country every 19 minutes. The key statistic is that only one out of 12 women reports rape to the Garda.While the Minister spouts statistics and tries to reassure people that the situation is improving, people have lost faith in the criminal justice system and have stopped reporting crime. Time and again I have heard the Minister make these rah-rah speeches when a little pressure is applied. The Minister turns up the volume a little, injects the odd cutesy phrase and the nice soundbite –"Do not rip up the Constitution", or "I know what I know", or "We are winning the war on crime" or "The gangsters' day will come". That is wearing thin. People have begun to see right through the Minister.As I said last night, people are now no safer than they were when the Minister took office. We need to treat these gangs like terrorists and we need to smash them. This Government has made promises on crime but has reneged on them again and again. The administration of justice is now being threatened. The Minister should be warned that his rhetoric and his denial are growing old, and that his clever speeches will not obscure the reality of a worsening situation.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	In response to a recent question I put to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on proposals to control excessive prices for alcohol, soft drinks and food charged by some pubs, clubs and restaurants, she informed me that she has no plans to reintroduce price controls on any product. She stated that price control was a feature of policy in the 1980s when inflation rates reached over 20% and that it is a policy mechanism which failed, with maximum prices for products tending to become the minimum. The Minister went on to say that she believes that increased competition is the best way to reduce prices and ensure consumers get value for money.On Monday, however, Ms Carmel Foley, the Director of Consumer Affairs, was quoted as saying that pub owners are reaping the benefits of an industry run like a monopoly and unthreatened by competition. Ms Foley said she believes that customers are continually exploited through high and indefensible prices. The Director of Consumer Affairs further stated that publicans are a privileged group of people who are not susceptible to the same level of competition due to current licensing laws which allow only a set number of pubs to operate. They are abusing their privilege by charging indefensible prices for alcohol and soft drinks in particular, given that there is no excise duty on such beverages. Ms Foley stated that anyone with eyes in their head can see the difference between what they pay for drinks in the supermarket and in the pub.The State has granted these people an amazing privilege but there is no gratitude for it. I acknowledge the genuine concerns about alcohol abuse, but the regrettable side effect is the unjustifiable enrichment of a small group due to the small number of licences. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment puts her faith in increased competition while the Director of Consumer Affairs speaks of publicans, who are not susceptible to the same level of competition, abusing their privilege. The gap between them could not be wider. Indeed, the Director of Consumer Affairs went as far as to urge more shops to sell alcohol in a bid to rein in rip-off pricing by greedy publicans.I raise this issue because a young woman from Waterford city, Maria O'Grady, made representations to me on the matter. The breaking point for her was when she was asked for €6 for a quarter bottle of wine in a city bar three weeks ago. As she pointed out to me, the wine cost €2.50 in  the supermarkets, and supermarkets make their profit at that price. Ms O'Grady did not whinge and whine about the situation, which she found unacceptable. She went out, gathered up the evidence and, armed with that, she contacted the media, the Director of Consumer Affairs and politicians. In a structured way she sought a solution.The prices she has quoted refer to Waterford city but there is no reason to believe that comparable prices are not being charged in other cities and large towns. Ms O'Grady instanced the fact that there is a difference of up to €1.40 in the price of a vodka in Waterford city, that night clubs with cover charges of up to €10 are charging up to €7 for a bottle of Budweiser and €4.50 for a vodka. These very high prices are not charged by average public houses but the fact that excessive profiteering is taking place at all is unacceptable.The price of soft drinks is also an area which requires attention. Comparisons between supermarket prices and some public house, club and restaurant prices need investigation and action. Maria O'Grady draws attention to the fact that wines which can be purchased in supermarkets at prices ranging from €5.99 to €12.99 are on restaurant wine lists from €25 to €35. She instanced a case where a portion of carrots in a restaurant costs €5.95.Publicans, like everyone else in business, are entitled to a reasonable level of profit but excessive profiteering is unacceptable. Ireland is no longer seen as a low cost country in terms of our tourism product. The Statistical Yearbook of Ireland 2003 indicates a 7.4% rise in prices in hotels, restaurants and licensed premises in 2002, while inflation was 4.6%.With regard to the consumer price index, all items increased by 30.5% during the period 1993-2002. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco increased by 52.6% over the same period but the figure for alcoholic beverages alone is not supplied. Restaurants and hotels showed a price increase of 48.9% for the period.The Minister's position on increased competition being the solution to excessive profiteering does not stand up to scrutiny. The drinks market is far from being a free market because of major restrictions on entry. I call on the Minister to enter into talks with the Director of Consumer Affairs with a view to effectively addressing the unacceptable practices exposed by Maria O'Grady.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	I am pleased to have this opportunity to reply to this debate on the prices for alcohol, soft drinks and food being charged by some pubs, clubs and restaurants. On the issue on prices generally, I am pleased to report that the latest figures produced by the Central Statistics Office show that annual inflation fell to 2.3% last month,  down from 2.9% in September. While this decrease in inflation is welcome, I recognise that the products to which Deputy O'Shea refers – alcohol, soft drink and food in pubs – have always been stubborn exceptions to the general decrease in inflation. However, the index does show a short-term trend over the previous three months of a slight decrease in prices in this area. I am convinced, however, that with the Government's price strategy this trend will continue.When visiting pubs and clubs people are entitled to know the prices they are expected to pay. The Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1999 obliges all premises where alcohol is sold to display the price of certain beers, spirits and soft drinks both outside and inside the premises. This provision gives the customer the information he or she needs to decide whether to enter the premises. The regulations are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs whose inspectors regularly visit licensed premises. Prosecutions have been and will continue to be made under these regulations to ensure they are complied with.To reinforce the information which consumers are entitled to the Government, as part of the Sustaining Progress programme, has initiated a price awareness campaign. The principle behind this campaign is that markets work more efficiently with fuller information and that over recent years consumer price awareness may have lessened. The purpose of the campaign, which will run over the four weeks of November on television, radio, cinema advertisements and national press, is to stimulate greater price awareness among consumers, promote price comparison and encourage consumers to have a greater regard to price in choosing goods and in this way to promote a culture of the "active consumer" and "consumer empowerment". The campaign is being run by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.On 13 November the director published the results of a price comparison survey taken by the director's inspectors in Cavan and Dublin. The results highlight the sometimes dramatic differences in price for the same product or service in the same town. Although the survey does not cover soft drinks it does cover alcohol. In Cavan, the difference between the cheapest and the dearest pint of Guinness was 9.7%. In Dublin, the difference was more startling at 16.4%. I could also point out even more remarkable differences in food, although this is at retail level and not in a pub or restaurant. There is a difference of 465% in the price of own brand beans between two retail premises in Dublin. This campaign and the director's survey show the need for consumer awareness and the clear benefits for consumers being more active.There is a link between the various strategies on prices described previously and the role of competition in these sectors. Competition between undertakings is a proven policy which ensures low prices. I have ensured that the Com petition Authority which enforces competition law has the tools to enable it to carry out its tasks. Last year, the Competition Act 2002 was passed which refined and strengthened provisions relating to the operation of cartels, the main focus of price collusion between undertakings. The Minister also ensured that the authority has the staff resources to carry out its functions. This strengthening of competition law and resources, together with consumer power, will provide the impetus for competition which in turn will help reduce prices. For this to work, however, consumers need to be active and price sensitive.On behalf of the Tánaiste I would like to comment on the constant calls for the reintroduction of price controls. Some Deputies will recall the experience of price control in the 1970s and 1980s when inflation reached nearly 25%. In this period price control covered a wide range of products and services. What people forget is that this regime needed numerous officials to process the price rise applications and to enforce the subsequent prices orders. It needed a whole division of the old Department of Industry and Commerce to provide the administrative back-up to support this system. Even then there was no evidence that price control had any appreciable effect on price inflation. There is also the perception by many that price control contributed to price inflation. The Tánaiste regards this policy as a failed one and she does not intend to reintroduce it. Rather, she puts her trust in consumer power together with competition to reduce prices.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and thank him for taking this Adjournment matter. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on his reforms and investment in the educational sector.I want the Minister for Education and Science to address the anomaly and the cost factor that exists for insurance between the voluntary secondary school and the community or vocational school. Under current legislation, voluntary schools must meet their responsibility for insurance while those in the community or vocational sector have their insurance paid for by the State. That is a serious imposition on the voluntary school sector and I ask that the Minister examine it with a view to creating an even playing field between those who provide education at second level.An example was provided by the umbrella body for voluntary secondary schools. Since 1999, a school of some 500 pupils has had its insurance costs increase from €24,000 to €35,000. I am aware that in smaller schools the costs have increased from approximately €6,000 to €14,000. In those situations we are talking about increases from 50% to 112%. That is not a cost that can be absorbed by the people in charge of these voluntary schools. If they do, it is at a cost to other services they provide at the school. Those cut backs have to be implemented in areas such as heating, lighting, essential repairs and other materials. Classroom supplies, such as paper, chalk and laboratory equipment must be cut back. It is a serious matter for voluntary schools. We appreciate and thank the religious orders who played an enormous role in this area and who ploughed a great deal of money into it. Listening to the public debate about their contribution, one would think they had a negative effect on the education system. However, I reject that and compliment them on what they have done over the years.People in charge of schools in the voluntary sector must pay insurance costs from their budgets, unlike those in the vocational and community sector. It must be borne in mind that they get full insurance cover from the State. I was told today by a principal of a school in my constituency that his costs increased from €5,700 to €14,000 between 1999 and 2003. That is an enormous burden. He has asked, through the joint managerial body which represents voluntary and secondary schools of all denominations – we are not talking about particular religious denominations – for that issue to be considered. They still account for 60% of all post-primary pupils and play an important role in this area.Secondary school management boards expect the Government to recognise the extraordinary efforts they continue to make by providing them with the same funding as other second level schools. They have three demands, but their main one is that the payment of insurance grants to all voluntary schools should be put on the same footing as other second level schools. That is the thrust of my argument.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	I thank Deputy Finneran for raising this matter. As he will be aware, the funding arrangements for our schools, including the arrangements made for insurance cover, have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. By its nature, this evolution has generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.As regards voluntary secondary schools, responsibility for obtaining insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools, which are privately owned. The onus for arranging insurance cover is on the relevant vocational education committee in the case of vocational schools and community colleges. As regards community and comprehensive schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities that may arise.The Minister and his predecessor have already shown their commitment by the introduction of enhanced equalisation funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. In addition to the per capita grant of €25 which was introduced under the school services support initiative for second level schools in September 2000 and which now stands at €99 since January last, secondary schools have benefited from a further increase of €28, bringing the grant for such schools to €127 from January last. This per capita grant was in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to additional equalisation funding of almost €30,000 per annum and overall additional support services funding of approximately €80,000 per annum.A further measure of the continuing commitment of the Minister for Education and Science is his announcement in the context of the 2004 Estimates that the support services grant of €127 per pupil will be further increased in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €131, a per capita increase of €4. This increase is in addition to the increase the Minister also announced for 2004, which will bring the standard per capita grant to €274. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that, since 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils will receive extra annual funding of up to €105,000 per annum and annual grants of up to €240,000, or €260,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives.Tackling the difficulties caused by high insurance premiums is also a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In that context, she has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the insurance market. The Government considers that these measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.The Minister is conscious of the concerns relating to insurance costs raised by the managerial authorities for voluntary secondary schools. He is committed to improving further the funding position of schools and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary school sector. At a time of increased financial constraints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of voluntary secondary schools is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18511	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue in the House and hope the Mini ster of State will openly consider it. Scoil Chaitríona is located in Coolock, caters for 300 pupils, and has disadvantaged status. Two pre-fabricated buildings are still in use. One dates from 1973 and the other dates from 1958, which is difficult to believe. People who were educated in these pre-fabs are sending their children to them 30 or 40 years later. These pre-fabs provide core teaching space. Some 51 children are in the double pre-fab every day. Resource teaching, life skills and many other activities take place there.The frugality of the sisters and the teaching staff meant that they repainted the pre-fabs, replaced windows and tried to keep them up to standard. This extended the life of the pre-fabs, but I am sure the Minister of State realises that they will not last for 42 years. The Minister of State would have to see the pre-fabs to believe their condition, but I am sure he does not have the opportunity to visit them. The roof is sagging and the windows cannot be opened. Rain comes in in five places for which five buckets must be produced while desks and books must be moved. The children must be wrapped up in their overcoats on a cold day. If the wind is blowing from the wrong direction, they must move because the rain comes in at an angle. The curtains are dripping wet most of the time because of rain and condensation.The school authorities have been campaigning about this for many years. Following particularly intense activity, the Department's architect called to the school and condemned the pre-fabs. However, what seems to have happened – I do not know if it is a misunderstanding in the Department – is that the replacement of the two pre-fabs has been wrapped up with an entirely separate project, namely, the provision of a resource room and library and improved fire and security measures in the school. These measures are needed, but they are not as pressing as the replacement of these two pre-fabs. I understand the Department refers to a section 12, which means replacing temporary buildings with temporary buildings. That is what should happen in this case. However, the Minister in a reply to a constituency colleague indicated that this is wrapped up with another project which he said is at an early stage of architectural development and is frozen, as of now, in the Department pecking order. We need to recognise that we are replacing a sub-standard prefab with a decent one. It does not need an architectural process. It is a matter of replacing one thing with something else. This has already been done with one of the prefabs and there are two remaining.I appeal to the Minister to use his ministerial discretion, which is clearly there, to recognise that this is not a case that should be left languishing in Department files with lots of other applications for new developments. It should be recognised as an essential replacement of a building that is long past its sell-by date. If the Minister will ensure that this occurs it will be much welcomed by the  teaching staff, the pupils and the parents who have been fighting for this for a long time.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	I am glad Deputy Richard Bruton has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the replacement of two temporary classroom units at Scoil Chaitríona, Coolock. Last January the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, published the 2003 capital programme and full details about individual projects are available on his Department's website. Section 12 of the programme sets out details of the provision of temporary accommodation in 2003. As Deputy Bruton mentioned, an official from the Department's technical building unit carried out an inspection and recommended that the three temporary classrooms be replaced. Since then, one of them has been replaced.The Minister intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify the progress planned for projects such as Scoil Chaitríona during 2004. I will bring to the attention of the Minister the Deputy's explanation about the apparent mix-up of the projects and ask him to investigate this immediately. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me to set out the Minister's position to the House.

On 24 April 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science wrote to his local colleague in Clonakilty, Deputy Walsh, confirming that he had authorised the appointment of a design team to initiate the architectural planning of an extension. Eighteen months later nothing has happened. From the reply to a parliamentary question on the matter it is clear that the design team was never appointed. It is also clear that the authorisation never existed. This means that essentially, the statement in the letter of 24 April 2002 was a lie, deliberately designed to mislead students, parents, teachers and the people of Clonakilty before the last election. They were told that a much-sought extension to their school would go ahead.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	I understand how you feel, a Cheann Comhairle, but I am referring to a statement rather than an individual. It is clear that the statement was a lie because even though it was stated in the letter that the design team had been authorised, when I tabled a Dáil question to the Minister he made it clear that no such authorisation had been given. I would prefer if the Minister for Education and Science were here to answer this, but I want to know why that hap pened. What is the explanation for this deception?What does the Minister have to say about the unanswerable case for a new extension? I do not want the flimflam about new projects and the 2003 budget, and that consideration will be given in 2004. I have seen all that rubbish before. There was a clear commitment to go ahead with this extension. The case for it is undeniable. This school was built for 400 students and there are now almost 600 students in the school – or rather, associated with it, because they cannot fit into it. There is an old premises at the other end of the town which is being used to accommodate students. School children are traipsing over and back through the town of Clonakilty every day. This is a health and safety issue as there is inadequate supervision for this activity and it is dangerous for the children. The local gardaí have expressed serious concern about their safety as they cross the streets of the town, over and back, every day of the school week.Things are almost as bad for the teachers. Their accommodation was designed for 30 teachers but there are now more than 45. There is no library in the school – the library space has been requisitioned for other purposes. Does the Minister accept that the case is unanswerable?I bring to the Minister's attention the outstanding reputation of the school, which is able to cope with these difficult and dangerous circumstances and provide an excellent education for its pupils. It has been recognised through the Gaelscoil movement – there are now a number of gaelscoileanna in west Cork – to the extent that a gaelcholáiste unit has been established in the school. It is fully recognised as an outstanding school but has been left in these dreadful circumstances by the Government. I raised the issue with the Minister and he told me he would consider it but that no new architectural design team would be appointed this year. That team was supposed to have been appointed last year.I feel strongly about what has happened here. It is no wonder there is cynicism about politics when Governments act in this fashion. I want this unfair situation resolved now. I want the extension to go ahead and I want an assurance from the Minister to that effect.

There are two schools serving the post-primary education needs of Clonakilty centre. These are the Sacred Heart secondary school, which is an all-girls school, and Clonakilty community college, which is co-educational. The community college was formed in 1980 as a result of the amalgamation of the town's vocational school and St. Mary's boys' secondary school. The school operates under the aegis of County Cork VEC. Since September 2001 an all-Irish unit within Clonakilty community college has been  operating with provisional recognition from the Department.The community college was built to cater for 400 pupils. Since then additional accommodation has been provided in permanent and temporary structures at the school to cater for increasing enrolments. The current enrolment in the college is 590. In early 2000, Cork VEC requested that the Department review the accommodation at the school and make capital funding available for refurbishment and an extension. The application was processed taking account of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area and the projected overall accommodation requirements in the centre. An accommodation brief to cater for a long-term  enrolment of 550 was agreed with the school authorities. Allowance was made for appropriate accommodation for the all-Irish unit. The project is one of a number which is awaiting the appointment of a design team.The Minister for Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify the progress which is planned for projects such as the extension and refurbishment of Clonakilty community college.

Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 age group free of charge at five year intervals.In regard to the roll out of the programme, under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to its full extension to the rest of the country. Planning and organising the national programme comprises a major undertaking that requires careful consideration involving significant logistical and resource implications. The Health Boards Executive, HeBE, has initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll out of the national programme. The work currently being undertaken as part of the roll out includes an evaluation of phase one, policy development and the establishment of national governance arrangements. This work is informed by both the experiences gained from the phase one programme and the learning derived from other international programmes and current international best practice.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	Following the publication of the report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group, the chief executive officers of the health boards established an expert group in 1997 to consider approaches to providing a home birth service. The expert group recommended three pilot projects, which were subsequently established  between 1999 and 2001 with funding from my Department. These included: a community midwifery service conducted in Cork by the Southern Health Board; a hospital outreach approach conducted by the Western Health Board and based at the University College Hospital, Galway; and a DOMINO-outreach project – domiciliary care in and out of hospital – based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. These pilot projects are now being evaluated under the auspices of the domiciliary births group, which was established by the chief executive officers group earlier this year at the request of my Department with the following terms of reference: to prepare an up to date progress report on the implementation of the recommendations from the expert group on domiciliary births – 1997; to make recommendations on the long-term approach, arising from the outcome of the pilot schemes, and to establish protocols and procedures; and to commission an external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects.The external evaluation of the three pilot home birth projects in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the service in the South-Eastern Health Board area, is due for completion shortly. The domiciliary births group will then engage in a public consultation process and report to the chief executive officers in February-March 2004. The group's report will inform the development of future national policies, procedures and protocols for domiciliary births. Bearing in mind the foregoing, consideration of the issue of legislation or regulations regarding home births should await the outcome of the deliberations of the domiciliary births group.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	Concerns were raised at the Fluoridation Forum about the consumption of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated tap water. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, which was represented on the forum, requested its scientific committee to conduct a risk assessment to determine if there is a risk of adverse effects in infants from the consumption of infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated tap water. The final report of the FSAI concluded that there is not significant evidence of any adverse effect, other than dental fluorosis, when assessing the risk of fluoride intake for young infants. The risk of moderate fluorosis in the primary and permanent dentitions was assessed as very low in exclusively formula fed infants aged 0 to four months.The final conclusions of the FSAI were not changed in any way by the Fluoridation Forum. The scientific committee of the FSAI, and not the Fluoridation Forum, updated its report to take account of new scientific evidence. The FSAI concluded that there is no significant evidence of any adverse effect, other than dental fluorosis, when assessing the risk of fluoride intake for young infants.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	The single most important factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A report called Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, carried out by my Department, identified a requirement for an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospitals by 2011 and this requirement is reflected in the Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for  You. Some 568 of these beds have been commissioned to date.In order to address the current increase in demand for acute beds, I have provided additional funding of €5.5 million in 2003 to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, €3.8 million, and to the Southern Health Board, €1.7 million, to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting thus freeing up acute beds.The Deputy will appreciate that due to the nature and complexity of the acute hospital system the number of beds in use at any one time may fluctuate. It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods of time. Bed closures result from ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures. In 2003 some hospitals, particularly in the Dublin region, have temporarily closed some beds for financial reasons in order to stay within budget.My Department routinely collects information on beds not in use in acute hospitals from health agencies on a quarterly basis. The most recent complete figures available to my Department relate to the first six months of 2003. This data shows that 50,584 bed days were lost in the period, which is equivalent to a daily average of 278 beds out of use representing just over 2% of the available acute bed stock.Following the accident and emergency nurses strike in March 2002 the Labour Relations Commission put forward a number of proposals in the area of accident and emergency management. It was agreed that the bed management function was fundamental to the consistent application of admission and discharge policy. In May 2002, CAPITA Consulting was commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, to carry out a national review of the bed management function. This review made specific recommendations that will assist hospitals to structure more effective and integrated bed management departments. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the CAPITA report are now being progressed by a combined management and nursing union steering group under the chairmanship of the HSEA.The HSEA also commissioned a detailed two stage staffing review of nurse staffing levels required in 36 dedicated emergency departments around the country. The staffing review examined existing structures and staffing levels in emergency medicine departments and included an assessment of the appropriate support, professional nursing role, skills and structures required. The second stage of the review has just been completed and the draft final report has been presented. As part of the process of considering the final report it is expected that the consultants will make a presentation on their findings to management and nursing unions in the near future.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Preven tion, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.As the Deputy is aware, I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected; and dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. Ultimately, the forum took an evidence based approach to its examination of water fluoridation.The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. Work on the establishment of the expert body is well under way. It will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1054	On 25 July 2003, I published the report of Mr. Kevin Bonner in relation to Monaghan General Hospital. I indicated at that time my acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I have also accepted that additional services can be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular, I welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity of the hospital within the Cavan-Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff within this new structure is a very significant development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.Mr. Bonner has recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service delivery is changing worldwide and that Monaghan hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In this context, the report's recommendations in relation to the range and configuration of acute services, including maternity services, to be delivered within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group are appropriate for consideration by the North-Eastern Health Board.The recently published national task force on medical staffing report, the Hanly report, will further inform decisions in this regard. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European Union working time directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1057	Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of family planning services to all persons in their area who need such services. These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, non-governmental organisations and, to some extent, maternity hospitals-units. Significant additional funding, €5.73 million, was provided for the development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services between 1999 and 2002.I understand that in August 2000, the Northern Area Health Board, in partnership with the Irish Family Planning Association, initiated a family planning-women's health service at the Irish Family Planning Association's premises in Cathal Brugha Street. The services provided are complementary to those available to medical card holders through their own general practitioner and they are intended to provide an element of choice for medical card holders in the area of reproductive health.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1060	I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 103, 214 and 216 together.The health sector reform programme affects almost every aspect of the system, in terms of structures and in terms of governance, accountability, planning, monitoring and evaluation. It has implications for all organisations in the sector and requires that new structures be put in place in certain cases. This requires a fundamental reform of the existing statutory provisions in respect of the roles, functions, organisation structure and management of the health system. In line with the Department's approach on the reform programme, an action project has been established to prepare the legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of new agencies in line with the Government decision on the implementation of the recommendations of the Brennan and Prospectus reports. The legislation will also incorporate any other consequential changes which may be necessary to give effect to the new reformed health system. It will incorporate legislative proposals arising from the other action projects. I envisage that I will be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation next year.

This approval was based on a detailed service assessment carried out by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which found that the volume, nature and complexity of paediatric conditions dealt with at Our Lady's Hospital required the provision of on-site MRI facilities. It has been accepted by the hospital, the ERHA and my Department that the proposed development is a priority in order to develop and enhance the existing level of diagnostic services for children. A project team was established to advance the planning of these facilities. The project team recently completed the design brief for the development, the overall capital cost of which is estimated as being of the order of €5 million. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that sanction has been given to appoint a design team to progress the next stage of this important development.

The EU has the most rigorous pre-marketing assessment of GM food and feed in the world. The safety of GM products will be independently assessed by the European Food Safety Authority and consumers will have a clear choice of products to buy as GM food will now be more clearly labelled. The EU will have a comprehensive and transparent system of authorisation and labelling that can only enhance consumer confidence. I am satisfied, therefore, that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure the safety of authorised GM foods, or foods containing geneti cally modified ingredients placed on the market in Ireland.The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs. The authority carries out checks on the marketplace for compliance with GM legislation. I am advised that it is satisfied, based on current scientific opinion, that GM products authorised within the EU are safe for human consumption. Three main legal instruments constitute the EU legislative framework on genetically modified organisms. The first of these is a regulation on GM food and feed, Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003, which is in force since 7 November 2003 and will have to be applied after a transitional period from April 2004. It replaces the GM part of Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients. Products from 16 GMOs can legally be marketed in the EU. These include soya, maize, processed foods derived from oilseed rape and maize and oil from cottonseeds. These products have all been notified as substantially equivalent in accordance with the novel food regulation.Article 46(1) of Regulation 1829/2003 on GM food and feed provides that applications for the authorisation of a GM food made under the novel foods regulation which have received a final scientific assessment before the coming into application of the new regulation are still to be processed under the novel foods regulation. Authorisation for a GM food will include labelling and traceability provisions as required by the new legislation. Eight GM products are pending authorisation under the novel food regulation, including maize, soybean and sugar beet. The scientific risk assessment has been finished for two of the applications, a GM sweet maize, Bt-11, and a GM field corn, GA-21. The EU Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health's opinion on the European Commission draft decision to authorise Bt-11 could be expressed as early as the next meeting in December, if it is approved by qualified majority. If no qualified majority is obtained, the decision will be referred to Council, which will have three months to act and to adopt or reject the proposed decision by qualified majority.

I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is in discussions with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, concerning the administration and funding of the nursing home  subvention scheme. I should point out that since my appointment as Minister of State, I have encouraged the authority and the health boards to introduce home care packages, including home based subvention, for clients applying for nursing home subvention as an alternative to long-stay residential care. The criteria for home based subvention is the same that applies for nursing home subvention. The fact that the overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1064	The House is aware that I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and the US in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia. As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in respect of the matters relevant to his investigations.Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60-page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US authorities will provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses. I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1065	Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. The comhairle established a committee to examine, inter alia, existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally. The committee will make recommendations on the future organisation and development of those services. The comhairle has published its report. Having considered it, I am happy to endorse its recommendations. The report recommends significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report recognises that aspects of a number of other specialties and services, such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry, are related to and overlap with neurology services. The comhairle has recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in respect of the development of neurology services.A national action plan for rehabilitation services is being prepared by my Department in line with this recommendation and the commitments in the national health strategy. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, the comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its publications will offer a comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country. My Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and the Irish Consultant Neurologists' Association on the future development of services. The implementation of the comhairle recommendations will be progressed having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area and in the context of competing funding priorities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1066	The latest report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994-2002: Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, shows that the incidence rates of prostate cancer in men in all age groups showed statistically significant increases. The rate of increase between 1994 and 2002 was 5%. In 2002, 1,571 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 540 died from the disease. It is important to note that while the incidence rates from prostate cancer are increasing, the mortality rates are not increasing at the same level. This divergence between incidence and mortality rates may be due to better case-finding, more incidental diagnoses or a genuine increase in survival.In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. Such a strategy is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. As part of this work, a sub-group of the forum has been established to examine generic screening. This multi-disciplinary group has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The group recommended that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate screening programme in this country. It recommended that the issue should be reassessed when the results are available from international randomised trials being conducted at present. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.I wish to advise the Deputy of a draft proposal from the European Commission for a Council of Europe recommendation on cancer screening. The proposal, which is expected to be accepted by the Health Council before the end of the year, provides a framework for consideration by member states of cancer screening programmes. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.

The action plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas at that time. Under the terms of Sustaining Progress, each sectoral performance verification group is required to make an assessment of progress in modernisation by 1 December 2003, a month in advance of the payment date of 1 January 2004 specified in the agreement. A sum of €188.194 million has been set aside for the payment of the second phase of the public service benchmarking body's pay recommendations to eligible staff in the health sector in 2004, subject to the successful completion of the performance verification process. The above figure includes the effect of general pay increases under Sustaining Progress on the benchmarking awards.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1068	Since the beginning of 2003, the Dunne inquiry has concentrated on the investigation of the post mortem policy, practice and procedure of the three main paediatric hospitals, the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. By the middle of October, the inquiry had heard from 56 hospital and non-hospital witnesses at oral hearings and had accumulated almost 3,500 pages of transcripts of oral evidence. The inquiry, which is non-statutory and conducts its hearings in private, continues to hear evidence. Its chairman has informed me that she has received considerable co-operation from each of the hospitals with which she is dealing. She said that the inquiry's non-statutory nature has not significantly hampered its substantive work so far. The chairman is mindful of the need to complete her report as soon as is reasonably practicable following the completion of the oral evidence. At 31 October 2003 the inquiry had incurred costs of €7.237 million. This figure includes the legal fees of the chairman and legal staff in the inquiry office and all administrative salaries and costs.

While the review was being considered by officials in my Department, the reports of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System were published. These reports are also known as the Brennan and Prospectus reports. Since the contents and recommendations of both of these reports are relevant to the subject matter of the GMS review, my Department asked Deloitte & Touche to update the draft in this light, having regard to the latest financial data from the GMS payments board. The final draft of this review has been received by my Department. I intend to bring this review to the Government as soon as possible, at which time its publication and implementation will be discussed.
Question No. 112 answered with Question No. 109.

This was confirmed in a study of asthma in Ireland conducted by Allen and Hanburys in conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland in 2001. This research extended a previous study carried out in seven European countries in 1999, which confirmed that there are variations in asthma prevalence among EU countries. Certain environmental issues such as smoking and workplace exposure to respiratory irritants are contributory factors in this respect, as is the fact that better diagnostic techniques are being used which identify asthma sufferers to a greater degree than before.

Such grants are administered through the relevant local authority. The use of health board staff such as occupational therapists to provide assessments for this scheme is a matter for discussion between the relevant local authorities and health boards. I am aware of the difficulties encountered by people applying for the disabled persons grant. My Department is engaging with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to streamlining the assessment procedures for the grant in question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	The information requested by the Deputy on employment levels for particular categories of health service staff is set out in the table at the end of this reply. He may wish to note the significant increases in employment since 1997. There  have been increases of 1,648, 33.1%, in the number of medical personnel, 6,409, 23.4%, in nursing staff and 6,684, 112%, in health and social care professionals including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, social workers and psychologists. The large increases in the employment of key front line professionals in the health services have been maintained despite the changed budgetary and economic environment. They have underpinned substantial increases in the quantity and quality of health and social care provided to the public, consistent with the major investments made in the health sector since 1997.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1073	I am advised by the Central Statistics Office that it does not intend to commission research into the number of abortions each year involving Irish women. Statistics regarding the number of Irish women who have abortions in the UK abortion clinics are collected by the UK Department of Health and Social Services. It is not possible to quantify the exact number of Irish women who opt for abortions in the UK or elsewhere, as some Irish women may not give their actual address in order to protect their confidentiality.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1074	The Deputy will be aware that I launched the agency's strategy for addressing the issue of crisis pregnancy last week. I met the agency's chairperson, Ms Olive Braiden, before the launch to discuss the strategy and the agency's progress in general. The main function of the agency is to provide a co-ordinating mechanism so that the efforts of all groups in the field of crisis pregnancy prevention are harnessed to maximum effect. The work of the agency is monitored by my Department and I am satisfied that it is equipped to fulfil its remit. There are no plans, therefore, to appoint an independent evaluator to review and oversee the work of the agency.

My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to look into this matter and to reply directly to the Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1076	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 124 together.The report of the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service is just one element of the Government's health service reform programme which also reflects key recommendations of the audit of structures and functions of the health system, undertaken by Prospectus strategy consultants. The reform programme is an extremely ambitious programme of change which cannot be implemented without detailed planning and transition management.I have outlined, in this House, the activity already completed or under way on implementation of the programme. The Government agreed that to succeed it would be necessary to clearly set out its vision of reform to all within the existing health system, including board members, staff and staff representatives. This engagement was undertaken as a vital first step in the implementation process. This is the process on which we have been engaged during the past number of months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1077	The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no fault compensation scheme for brain damaged infants has met regularly since its establishment in July 2001. The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. I hope it will be in a position to present its final report in 2003.Recent settlements made on behalf of infants with cerebral palsy emphasise the need to complete the examination of the issue being undertaken by the advisory group. However, as the group has already indicated its intention of completing its work by the end of this year, I feel that it would not be appropriate to ask them to expedite the process.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	The dental profession is largely a self regulating profession governed by the statutory provision of the Dentist's Act 1985.In general, there is a natural decline in the use of amalgam as a filling material in adults and children. In children, there is a greatly increased use of fissure sealants and composite resin based materials instead of amalgam. With adults, there is a similar pattern with composite fillings increasing in number mainly due to concerns about aesthetics.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1079	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 150 together.Over the past two or three decades there has been numerous important advances in surgical technology and in anaesthesia. These advances have improved greatly the range, the safety and the effectiveness of the surgical procedures that can be offered by modern health systems. However as a consequence, there has been dramatic increases in the demand for surgical procedures, especially elective procedures.Due to the nature of any health care system not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately. Hospital facilities must be used to best effect and it is sometimes necessary to place patients for non-urgent treatments on a waiting list. Therefore, the significant issue from the patient's perspective is the length of time spent waiting for treatment and as such this Government's objective is to reduce waiting times significantly in the short-term with particular focus on those waiting longest for treatment.Despite pressures on the acute hospital system considerable progress has been made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients. The waiting list data for the period ended 30 June 2003 showed that there were significant reductions in the number of adults and children waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target surgical specialties has fallen by approximately 43% from 7,407 to 4,252 in the period June 2002 to June 2003. The total number of children waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment in the same specialties and for the same period has decreased by approximately 57% from 1,576 to 676.

This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board, through the sale of surplus lands, and my Department. The projected full project cost is €101.4 million. This includes an amount of €5 million approved earlier this year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.

This includes services in respect of children and vulnerable adults provided by external agencies but funded by the health boards.My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed me that following a review of Garda vetting arrangements, a central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to deal with the then known demand for vetting. It was envisaged that when the central vetting unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared that a phased extension of Garda clearance arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placement. The Department of Health and Children is participating in the working group with the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General. The work of the group is ongoing at present. The group will report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse.There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers/organisations to maintain good employment practice during the recruitment stage such as, good interviewing practice, checking references and, also, when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.

I welcome the publication of this report and acknowledge the important role the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country.In his 2002 report, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities, from 4,256 at the end of 2001 to 3,966 at the end of 2002. Approximately 11%, 2,723, of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 2002 were involuntary admissions. Ireland has a significantly higher rate of involuntary admission than other European countries. However, it is anticipated that the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001, with its more stringent procedures for involuntary detention, will significantly reduce the number of involuntary admissions, bringing practice in this country more into line with the rest of Europe.In his report, the inspector refers to the ongoing replacement of old institutional mental hospitals with acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. He expresses disappointment at the failure of the newly-constructed psychiatric units at Portlaoise General Hospital and Castlebar Regional Hospital to open as planned in 2002. However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both of these units are expected to open shortly. The process of commissioning new acute psychiatric units at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown and at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, is also advancing.The inspector welcomed the considerable reinforcement of various sub-specialties within psychiatry, with the appointment of additional consultants in later-life psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry and liaison psychiatry in general hospitals and he is complimentary of the developments in mental health care in all health boards and highlights the many improvements which have taken place in the care of the mentally ill over recent years.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1086	The single most important factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A report entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, carried out by my Department, iden tified a requirement for an additional 3,000 acute beds in acute hospitals by 2011 and this requirement is reflected in the Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You. Some 568 of these beds have been commissioned to date.In order to address the current increase in demand for acute beds I have provided additional funding of €5.5 million in 2003 by way of €3.8 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and €1.7 million to the Southern Health Board to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting thus freeing up acute beds.Following the accident and emergency nurses strike in March 2002 the Labour Relations Commission put forward a number of proposals in the area of accident and emergency management. It was agreed that the bed management function was fundamental to the consistent application of admission and discharge policy. In May 2002, CAPITA consulting were commissioned by the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, to carry out a national review of the bed management function. This review made specific recommendations that will assist hospitals to structure more effective and integrated bed management departments. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the CAPITA report are now being progressed by a combined management and nursing union steering group under the chairmanship of the HSEA.The HSEA also commissioned a detailed two stage staffing review of nurse staffing levels required in 36 dedicated emergency departments around the country. The staffing review examined existing structures and staffing levels in emergency medicine departments and included an assessment of the appropriate support, professional nursing role, skills and structures required. The second stage of the review has just been completed and the draft final report has been presented. As part of the process of considering the final report it is expected that the consultants will make a presentation on their findings to management and nursing unions in the near future.As part of the winter initiative package in 2000-01, additional funding of some €40 million aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients was provided. Part of this investment package was aimed at the recruitment of an additional 29 emergency medicine consultants, of which 20 have been recruited to date.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	Influenza is an acute viral respiratory illness. It is characterised by sudden onset of symptoms, which include a temperature of 38ºC or more with a dry cough, headache, sore muscles and sore throat. The cough is often severe and protracted, but otherwise the disease is self-limiting. While those who are in good health usually recover from influenza in two to seven days there are others for whom the disease is much more severe. In those with underlying diseases, especially the elderly, complications are common and hospitalisation rates are high.Many respiratory diseases occur every winter but influenza is one of the most severe. The World Health Organisation estimates that influenza typically infects 10%-20% of the world population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in between three and five million cases of severe illness and at least 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year worldwide.

Representatives from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners are on this group along with other stakeholders.The intake of trainees into general practice vocational training programmes in recent years has increased from 55 in 1998 to 84 in 2003, reflecting an acknowledgement that provisions had to be made to ensure for the future manpower needs in general practice. In fact, 186 applications were received for inclusion in the general practitioner training schemes in 2003, giving a clear indication that general practice is still an attractive specialist option for graduates.My Department has provided €1.314 million in 2003 for general practitioner vocational training schemes and will seek to maintain, and hopefully increase funding in this area, as resources permit.

The report of the national task force on medical staffing deals with the re-organisation of acute hospital services in two regions, the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Regional Health Board.

Qureshi, paediatric cardiologist at Guy's and Thomas's Hospital, London.The terms of reference of the panel are to consider the report of the ERHA in relation to the events of 30 June 2003 at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, and to make such further inquiries and conduct such interviews as the panel considers necessary to address the questions raised by the family; to examine protocols and procedures relevant to this incident having regard to prevailing standards of best practice, and to examine their application in this case; to report to the Minister and to make such recommendations as it sees fit. Following the review, both reports will be made available.The work of the review panel is ongoing and I am not in a position to say, at this stage, when it will become available.

Recipients of DCA also qualify for the respite care grant, which in 2003 will amount to €735 where there is one DCA recipient in a family and €1,470 where there are two or more DCA recipients in a family.I should point out that the rate of DCA increases each year in line with social welfare increases. DCA was increased from €179.80 to €188.90, effective from 1 January 2003. There are no plans to increase that rate further in 2003.My Department, in conjunction with the national health board working group on disability-related allowances, in July 2002, implemented the revised circulars on the various allowances or grants, including DCA, operated by my Department. The revised circulars have been effective in standardising administration procedures for those allowances.The national health board working group on disability-related allowances, in its submission to my Department, recommended the establishment of a medical review group to examine the medical eligibility criteria for the various allowances or grants, including DCA. I have recently received nominations for the medical review group from the health boards chief executive group, and I envisage that the medical review group will commence in early 2004.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1094	The health service reform programme is based on the Government's decisions relating to the audit of structures and functions in the health system and the report of the Commission on Financial Management and Controls in the Health Service. Both reports identified this as the most important change required to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and reform set out in the health strategy docu ment Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You.The Government agreed that health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority will be abolished as part of the overall health reform programme. It considered that, as we have an Exchequer-funded health service with centrally determined resourcing decisions, Oireachtas Members should have greater responsibility to ensure that there is an appropriate match between funding of services and national priorities.Prospectus strategy consultants found that, in an attempt to meet the diversity of patient needs and respond to local consumer and political involvement, several structures and functions have been duplicated or executed in different ways. It was accepted that the intention is often to meet the needs of multiple stakeholders. Nevertheless, the result is sometimes weak integration of services and multiple contact points for patients.That situation derives from the fact that, since the Health Act 1970, the scope and level of activities mandated for health boards have increased. In that period, individual health boards have evolved at different paces, resulting in considerable variation in their organisational structures and practices. National strategies and policies have also added a number of additional functions to individual health boards, e.g. population health, social inclusion, etc. The different structural approaches, taken in response to their expanding functions, increase the likelihood of variable performance between health boards.It would be impractical to expect identical structures across the boards, particularly given the variation in geographic and demographic profiles, as well as varying service needs between each board. Nevertheless, the analysis suggests that the different pace of evolution and the current structural differences both in and between health boards leads to practical difficulties in a number of areas, for example, ensuring a standardised approach to the preparation and implementation of national strategies, and working on a conjoint basis on individual service or policy matters.In addition to moving to a single service executive delivery unit, the Government has also endorsed the need for improvements in governance in many aspects of the system, including the existing health board structures. Some of the concerns raised in the analysis related to: potential tensions between local area concerns, regional interests and national policy objectives; competition between representatives on boards based on locality or professional background rather than objective need; decision-making which is not always based on best practice or evidence; and a tendency to focus on operational and short-term issues over strategic issues.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1095	The Deputy may wish to note that, given that the health service accounts for more than 30% of overall public service employment, a pro rata application of the Government's targeted reduction in public service employment of 5,000 would have required an aggregate reduction in health service employment of 1,728 staff in whole-time equivalent, or WTE, terms.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1096	Measles is a highly infectious and serious disease. Approximately one in 15 children who contract measles will suffer serious complications. The MMR vaccine protects against the disease and can be administered to children at 12 months of age. A vaccine uptake rate of 95% is required to protect children from measles and to stop the spread of the disease in the community.I am concerned about the unsatisfactory MMR immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000, which resulted in three deaths and approximately 2,000 cases, is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1097	The recently published mid-term evaluation of the NDP recommended a reduction in the health capital allocation for acute hospitals for 2004. However, that recommendation was based on several misconceptions. In particular, the report suggests that the expansions of bed capacity should be conditional on full utilisation of existing capacity. In that context, reference is made to 270 beds being closed over the year 2002. That amounts to a very small percentage of bed capacity. More generally, it is unrealistic to expect that the acute hospital system can operate in an optimal manner at anywhere near 100% utilisation. While it may be tempting to think that, ideally, all beds in all hospitals should be occupied at all times, acute hospitals offering an emergency service are subject to random and potentially significant fluctuations in demand for admissions. An optimal rate of bed capacity must be low enough to avoid unresponsiveness in the face of sudden and unanticipated peaks in demand.The report correctly notes that 20% of beds in public hospitals are designated as private or semi-private. However, the report goes on to suggest that the public health system could immediately gain an additional 20% of capacity by the redesignation of those beds. That ignores the fact that the majority of such beds are occupied by emergency admissions, and a re-designation of beds occupied by such patients would not have any effect in freeing beds.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1098	The best public health measure to prevent influenza is the use of inactivated influenza vaccines. The strains of the influenza virus are subject to constant change, and that is closely monitored by the World Health Organisation, or WHO, and other health organisations around the world. The vaccine is prepared each year using virus strains similar to those considered most likely to be circulating in the forthcoming season.On 28 February 2003, the WHO published a recommendation on the composition of influenza vaccines for use in the 2003-2004 northern hemisphere influenza season. Current vaccines are trivalent, containing antigens from two type-A and one type-B virus strains. Each year the WHO advises on the composition of the vaccine for the influenza season.The recommendation was as follows: A/new Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus; A/Moscow/ 10/99(H3N2)-like virus – the widely used vaccine strain is A/Panama/2007/99; B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like virus – currently used vaccine strains include B/Shandong/7/97, B/Hong Kong/330/2001, B/Hong Kong/1434/2002.Laboratory testing so far this year shows that the main strain circulating is influenza A (H3N2), a Fujian-like strain. That is slightly different from the A (H3N2) Panama-like virus, which has been circulating in Europe in recent years. The current flu vaccine contains the Panama-like virus and is considered to offer some protection against the Fujian-like strain and good protection against other strains that may also circulate.The impact of the influenza vaccine in reducing mortality from influenza in older people is well documented. Protection lasts about one year and, therefore, it is important that individuals who are at risk of contracting influenza be vaccinated annually against the current strains.

The review was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance, following a Government decision in 1999. The O'Shea report was formally launched on 25 June 2003 at a joint press conference with Deputy Coughlan, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The Minister launched the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland at the joint press conference. Following the publication of the O'Shea and Mercer reports, it was agreed that a working group should be established by my Department to review the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme.The inaugural meeting of the working group is due to take place in early December. One of the items for discussion by the working group at its first meeting will be the terms of reference for the review, and as such it is not possible at present to provide details to the Deputy. However, I will ensure that the terms of reference are forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are approved by the working group.The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients, provide equity in the system to include standardised dependency and means testing, be less discretionary, provide both a home and nursing home subvention depending on need, be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on experience of the operation of the old scheme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1101	The report of the national task force on medical staffing contains a series of recommendations on reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors in all hospitals, including smaller facilities. The most immediate steps required are: a replacement of the present system of tiered or layered on-call service, where a number of junior doctors are on call at once; use of cross cover between specialities, so that the number of doctors on call at once can safely be reduced; and revised working patterns for junior doctors.The Health Services Employers Agency has written to the Irish Medical Organisation inviting it to recommence discussions in the Labour Relations Commission on issues associated with the implementation of the European working time directive. A date for the recommencement of discussions is to be agreed between both parties. The task force also recommends a series of medium to long-term measures which will be of considerable importance in helping reduce the average working hours of NCHDs. Those include the development of a consultant-provided service and the reorganisation of acute hospital services.

As of 31 October 2003, the deadline for claim submission, the board had received more than 36,000 claims, which are currently being processed. All claims received by the deadline of 31 October 2003 will be processed and paid by the end of December. The final cost and the numbers qualifying for reimbursement will not be known until all applications have been processed.The GMS payments board agreed with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, or IPU, the data required to support refund claims, and claimants were advised of that process. The payments board has informed the Department that individual pharmacists have been most helpful and accommodating to their clients in supplying the information requested. I have agreed that, while the deadline has not been extended, the GMS payments board will deal sympathetically with individual claims where people have difficulty obtaining the necessary information to make a claim.

Potential officers' courses are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions.The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence. The IPMS will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. A proposed IPMS has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee.Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on any of the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the intention that a potential officers course will be run as soon as those discussions are completed.The Feely report referred to by the Deputy was, I understand, an internal military discussion document and does not form my Department's policy in the area of commissioning from the ranks.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1108	I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 161 together.In accordance with a Government decision and following approval by the Minister for Finance, a humanitarian aid scheme is being implemented by the Office of Public Works through the aegis of the Red Cross. This scheme provides for aid to relieve hardship experienced by householders. Assessment by the Red Cross of all aid applications received under the scheme is now almost complete and I understand payments will issue before the end of November.In response to a request from Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works provided machinery and personnel to assist in the initial clean up. While I understand the Office of Public Works does not have statutory responsibility for further protection works, I am advised that it is prepared to consider further requests from Mayo County Council for assistance in the form of machinery and personnel, similar to that already provided.In addition, sympathetic cognisance will be taken of the disruption caused to farming activities by these unfortunate occurrences and where existing applications for aid under the various on-farm investment and installation aid schemes are affected, these will be examined by my Department on an individual basis in the context of the relevant force majeure provisions.Under EU regulations governing the livestock premium schemes, farmers may be excused from the requirement to retain animals for the retention period if failure to retain such animals arose from circumstances outside of their control. Farmers are obliged to notify my Department of such circumstances within ten days of the loss being incurred. No such notifications have been received in my Department's local office.Furthermore, my Department is not yet aware of any farmer affected by the landslide whose herd is currently restricted under the TB and-or brucellosis eradication schemes. Farmers who have such concerns are advised to contact their local district veterinary office.

Under the review, which has been ongoing since 1999, the Irish Medicines Board carries out the detailed examination of application dossiers submitted by sponsoring companies. On this basis, the board makes a recommendation to me for a final decision on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions, including route of supply, accompanying such licence.In terms of designating routes of supply for individual vaccines, my Department does not have a general approach which would as a matter of policy necessarily exclude any of the categories provided for under the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996. Rather, the decision is taken on the basis of the characteristics of each individual product taking account of the relevant recommendation of the Irish Medicines Board and the objective criteria laid down in regulation 13 of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996.

She remains in FARC captivity, along with the former Governor of Meta province, a former cabinet minister, 12 regional deputies, approximately 40 members of the state security forces, and several hundred other Colombian citizens. Three US citizens are also being held captive.As I have previously informed the House, on 31 January 2003 President Uribe established a commission to evaluate the possibility of a humanitarian exchange of hostages held by FARC for terrorist prisoners detained by the state authorities. The three-member commission is composed of Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, vice-president of the Colombian Episcopal Conference, Mr. Angelino Garzón, a former minister for labour, and Father Darío Echeverri, the secretary of the Catholic Conciliation Commission.At the London meeting on international support for Colombia on 10 July 2003, Ireland and its EU partners, together with other major donors to Colombia, condemned all violent acts against the civilian population and elected representatives in Colombia and called for the release of kidnap victims. We further expressed our willingness to provide assistance to the Colombian Government and the UN in their peace efforts and called upon all the illegal armed groups to agree to a ceasefire and to enter a serious negotiating process to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1116	The protection of the rights of children everywhere in the world is a matter of great importance. However, the plight of the so-called "street children" in Guatemala and Honduras is particularly poignant. These street children are born into the most marginalised sectors of society and, for reasons related mainly to their domestic circumstances, find themselves living on the streets, exposed to a life of malnutrition, petty crime, drug addiction, violence, prostitution and, in some cases, murder. Reports from Amnesty International and other non-governmental agencies allude to the extra judicial execution of many such children, often, it is alleged, with the involvement of security forces. It is estimated that in Honduras alone, more than 2,000 children have been killed in this manner since 1998.The Government, through the official development co-operation programme, Development Co-operation Ireland, supports a wide variety of initiatives and programmes aimed at addressing the problem of street children in Latin America, as well as in other regions. Both Trócaire and GOAL, who administer numerous programmes relating to poverty reduction and social development, are now receiving significantly increased funding through the new multi-annual programmes scheme, MAPS.My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, paid a visit to Honduras earlier this year and was able to familiarise himself first-hand with the problems being addressed by Irish NGOs and missionaries using Development Co-operation Ireland funding. Officials from my Department, including those from the embassy in Mexico, visit these countries on a regular basis and have specifically paid visits to project sites dealing with street children in a number of cities. Development Co-operation Ireland is currently reviewing its regional strategy for Central America and, in doing so, will be taking into account its experiences of the issue of street children.

As a matter of general policy and in the interests of equity, the State Examinations Commission is not in a position to provide any facility in individual cases at the examinations when it is not in a position to provide such a facility for all candidates in a similar position.However, the commission instructs all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their advising examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made through the examining process to ensure that the candidate is given credit for all work done.My Department provides additional assistance to schools catering for non-national pupils who have difficulty as a result of English not being their mother tongue. At post-primary level this ranges from three extra teaching hours per week for schools with one pupil in this position, to a full-time additional post where there are at least 14 pupils for whom English is not the mother tongue. My Department also provides funds to Integrate Ireland Language and Training to provide training and support materials for teachers in meeting such pupils' needs. In addition, pupils may also avail of the support of the school's learning support teacher or resource staff where this is deemed to be warranted by the school.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1119	There have been significant improve ments in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in the per capita grant to €274 per pupil, as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. This increase will bring the grant to €312 in the case of disadvantaged schools. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil that was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002, and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last to €99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools the grant was increased by a further €28 to €117 in September 2002 bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to €127 per pupil from January last. In the context of the 2004 Estimates the grant will be further increased to €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, €44.44 per pupil, per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €105,684 per annum and annual grants of €242,5001, €261,551 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those referred to by the Deputies.Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that these measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources.

The extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available, under the schemes, for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.However, there is provision for tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in publicly funded colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. It is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered here by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.

It was never intended that nursing home subventions would meet the full costs of private nursing home care.A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of keeping within their overall allocation as notified annually in the letter of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.The Deputy may be aware of the following due to his membership of the ERHA up until recently. The authority has decided that all contract beds becoming vacant after 1 September are not being renewed and that the resulting funds will be transferred to the enhanced subvention scheme. Funding for enhanced subvention in the South-Western Area Health Board is allocated to patients from St. James's Hospital, Tallaght Hospital, Naas Hospital and for clients in the community on a rotational basis. The authority has advised that the board has four waiting lists comprising of a waiting list for each hospital and one for the community. The total number of people currently on a waiting list for enhanced subvention is 64.In July my Department made €3.8 million available to the ERHA for a nursing home subvention to relieve pressure on the acute hospital sector. The funding is being targeted at older people inappropriately accommodated in acute hospitals in the Dublin area whose discharge to more appropriate step-down facilities has been delayed because of a lack of public long-stay facilities. Since 1 September the SWAHB has approved 51 clients for enhanced subvention from the additional funding.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1139	Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services to medical card holders. Arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody, are a matter for the boards, having regard to their priorities within the funding provided. Chiropody services provided by health boards vary somewhat through the country. In general priority is given to medical card holders who are aged 65 years and over and certain other categories of persons with illnesses, including diabetes and arthritis, who have been referred by their general practitioner or community nurse as being in need of the service.My Department is aware of difficulties being experienced by some eligible persons who are being levied a surcharge by some chiropodists-podiatrists for services that were previously provided free of charge. Officials from my Department have written to the chief executive officer group on the matter. The action taken by the chiropodists-podiatrists is totally at variance with the spirit and custom of the health board chiropody scheme and the charges being levied are inappropriate.The case highlighted by the Deputy has been referred to the regional chief executive officer of the ERHA for investigation. He has been asked to ensure that no inappropriate fee is levied on the patient involved and to reply directly to the Deputy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. To date, more than 8,000 patients have received treatment under the NTPF. The fund has the capacity to treat up to 800 patients per month predominantly in Ireland and in four hospitals in the UK. The NTPF will continue to identify capacity to treat those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1142	Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of €29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 87 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology.The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred. For example, the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment has increased from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000. This means that an additional 1,407 patients are accessing these services, representing an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment has increased from 2,693 in 1994 to 3,519 in 2000, representing an increase of 30% nationally. Similarly, breast cancer surgery has increased from 1,333 in 1997 to 1,854 in 2001. This is an increase of 39% nationally.As the Deputy is aware, I recently launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1145	Responsibility for the provision of health services at Peamount Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA.In July 2000, Comhairle na nOspidéal made a number of recommendations on the future organisation and delivery of respiratory and tuberculosis services. Comhairle recognised the valuable role which Peamount Hospital has played for many years. However, in line with major advances in medical treatment, it recommended that the optimal in-patient care of patients with respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis, is more appropriate to local acute general hospitals, staffed by consultant respiratory physicians and other consultants supported by an array of investigative facilities.This approach to care and treatment is mirrored in the Report of the Task Force on Medical Staffing, otherwise known as the Hanly report. The report found that there was convincing evidence that best results in care and treatment are achieved when patients are treated by staff working as part of a multi-disciplinary specialist team and that better clinical outcomes are achieved in units which have the required number of specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities.Peamount Hospital was not regarded by Comhairle na nOspidéal as an appropriate location for the treatment of TB patients, especially those requiring ventilation and specialised treatment for other symptoms, heart disease, HIV, etc., who may present with TB.

The standards cover the areas of training, equipment and the ambulance fleet.My Department is advised by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the equipment standard in particular is a recognised standard and is exceeded in most cases. My Department is also advised that staffing levels in the service are based on service need and that adequate numbers of ambulance personnel are employed in the service to respond to current need.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1147	Staffing requirements in the areas highlighted by the Deputy should be viewed in the context of the very substantial increases in employment levels achieved in these areas over recent years. In this context, comparing employment levels at the end of June 2003 to those at the end of 1999, there were nearly 25% – 6,711 – more nurses, 23% – 1,239 – more medical/dental personnel and 85% – 5,817 – more health and social care professionals employed in the health services in wholetime equivalent, WTE, terms.Developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body – subject to the successful completion of the performance verification process – will make a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The ongoing implementation of the action plan for people management – a key action under the health strategy – has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled professional staff.Specific human resource initiatives have contributed significantly to meeting the human resource requirements of the health services, including those highlighted by the Deputy.As far as the therapy professions are concerned, the report, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapists and this required a very substantial increase in therapy training places in order to meet the long-term requirements of the health services.

Portlaoise itself has suffered the delay and deferral of capital projects to improve conditions for its inmates and staff due to the need to meet escalating overtime costs.In excess of €60 million is being spent on overtime earnings of about 3,300 prison officers, which is considerably more this year than the overtime expenditure on the entire Garda force of 11,900 members.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1163	The number of overtime hours budgeted by the Irish Prison Service for the Midlands Prison, Portlaoise, in 2002 was 171,912, costing €4,837,604 approximately, and the actual number of overtime hours worked was 193,171, costing €5,435,832 approximately.The number of overtime hours budgeted by the Irish Prison Service for the Midlands Prison, Portlaoise, for 2003 to date – 31 October 2003 – is 144,351, costing €4,186,179 approximately, and the actual number of overtime hours for the same period is 160,554, costing €4,656,066 approximately.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1164	Following the expected departure of the small number of remaining residents from Beladd Park at the end of this year, some works will be carried out to improve security in the vicinity of the portion of the Midlands Prison boundary which adjoins the estate to prevent further incursions in the area by persons throwing contraband over the prison wall. Regarding the future use of the houses, I have yet to make a final decision on the use to which they may be put but I advise the Deputy that disposal of the property is not in contemplation at this juncture.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1165	I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.I fully concur, as does the Government, with the assessment of the Prison Officers' Association proposal by the director general of the Irish Prison Service, which is to the effect that the document referred to by the Deputy is essentially a claim for an increase in basic pay. Increases in basic pay are precluded under Sustaining Progress and, in those circumstances, the Government is not prepared to authorise the Irish Prison Service to enter talks in any forum where a proposal involving such an increase would be part of the discussions. Incidentally, the productivity gain measures proffered by the Prison Officers' Association represent only a small fraction of the reforms required to bring prison service staffing costs under control. They would not produce savings on anything like the scale suggested by the association.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1166	The missing persons helpline has been operating since October 2002. It is a dedicated helpline operated by Victim Support as a counselling and referral service and primary point of contact for the families of missing persons. The helpline provides advice and psychological support for families of missing persons as well as structured liaison with the Garda Síochána. A total of €65,000, including start-up costs, was made available for the helpline by my Department in 2002 and funding of a further €45,000 has been provided in 2003.A condition of funding was that an independent evaluation would be carried out after the helpline had been in operation for one year. That evaluation is under way and will consider, inter alia, some of the issues raised in the question. When the report of the evaluation is available, my Department will consult Victim Support and the Garda Síochána with a view to deciding how best to proceed.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1167	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations being carried out by the Operation Trace team have been subsumed into the operational investigative work being performed by the national bureau of criminal investigation. New lines of inquiry based on information coming to hand and searches, where required, are carried out by national bureau of  criminal investigation personnel in conjunction with local gardaí.I have set out the position with regard to the response of my Department and the Garda Síochána to the issue of missing persons in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 304 of 1 October 2003. There is no budget allocated specifically for the search for missing persons as this type of duty forms part of normal operational policing. The actual cost incurred could only be determined and obtained with expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and resources.It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether he has any particular legislation or protocols in the United States in mind, but I am willing to consider any suggestions he may care to make.In spring 2004, two members of the Garda Síochána will participate in the Garda McCabe fellowship, examining the issues relating to adult and child missing persons. The McCabe fellowship is a charitable foundation run by An Garda Síochána in partnership with John Jay College with the support and participation of the New York Police Department.With regard to highlighting cases such as that of the persons referred to by the Deputy, the Garda Síochána participates fully with all aspects of the media in highlighting cases involving missing persons. All cases of persons reported missing in suspicious circumstances are subject to ongoing review and investigation. The services of other agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist the gardaí in missing persons investigations.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1168	The staffing level of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds is 670. On 31 October 2003 there were 658.55 staff serving in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, leaving 11.45 vacancies. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to maintain staffing levels at the absolute maximum at all times due to time lags that may inevitably arise between a vacancy arising and the filling of that vacancy. For an organisation of its size, a vacancy level of 11.45 staff or 1.7% of the establishment strength, represents the optimum at which staffing levels could be maintained, particularly given the turnover of staff in the current buoyant economic climate. Overtime is utilised by the registries as a mechan ism to overcome any problems associated with temporary vacancies arising from delays in filling outstanding vacancies.The problem identified by the Deputy refers to shared ownership leases in the Dublin region and I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that there are 603 such cases pending at present. Of these, only 70 were lodged pre-2003. Of the 70 pre-2003 cases, almost 100% are under query and cannot be processed until a reply is received. It is the experience of the Land Registry that a high percentage of shared ownership lease cases are not in order when lodged. Resultant delays in completion are outside the control of the Land Registry.It is a policy in the Dublin region of the Land Registry to expedite shared ownership leases when requested in writing by the local authority. This is to facilitate the situation where the tenant is buying out the local authority's interest in the property. Many of the shared ownership leases have been executed a number of years prior to lodgment in the Land Registry. Therefore, while the Land Registry deals with these cases as priority cases, the leases may be a few years old by the date they are presented for registration and this could also explain some of the delays being experienced by the tenants who are re-mortgaging.In addition, a number of shared ownership leases are first registration cases which require an investigation of entitlement to registration of ownership by an examiner of titles and these cases can be complex and time consuming to process.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1169	I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that there are no applications pending on the folio number referred to by the Deputy at present. If the Deputy can provide me with any details about an application lodged in the Land Registry in relation to this folio, I will make further inquiries on her behalf.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1170	A grant application for capital grant assistance from the 2000-2006 Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme was  received from this community based group in March 2003.In September 2003, having considered this application in light of all information available at that time, the programme appraisal committee did not recommend that I fund this project under the capital measure of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006. The project had limited impact on the objectives of the programme due to short opening hours and therefore did not represent value for money.I understand from the child care directorate that the group in question has submitted an appeal which has been forwarded to ADM Limited. This appeal is currently undergoing a thorough re-assessment and all new or additional information will be considered. On completion of the assessment process, this application will be reconsidered by the programme appraisal committee before I make a final decision.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1171	I can inform the Deputy that the Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour, establishes the Special Residential Services Board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention, and re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. The Act is a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and the Department of Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1172	The persons referred to in the Deputy's question, a New Zealand national father and his teenage son and daughter, arrived in the State on 6 March 2001. The father in question had obtained Irish citizenship in December 1999 by registering in the Foreign Births Register.It was not possible for the children to obtain Irish citizenship through foreign births registration as their father had not registered prior to their births. The only option open to them, therefore, to obtain Irish citizenship is through the process of naturalisation.On 23 February 2002, the father requested application forms for citizenship for his teenage children. On 1 March 2002 the father applied for naturalisation for his son. I approved this application on 18 February 2003. A letter conveying my decision and requesting the completion of certain necessary formalities issued to the father on 5 March 2003. To date, my officials have not received the necessary response to this letter to enable them to issue a certificate of naturalisation in this case.There is no record of an application having been made either on behalf of the daughter prior to her eighteenth birthday or on her own behalf after that date. It is open to her to make an application at any time and any such application will be assessed against the criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986 and 2001.The father has indicated in correspondence with my Department that his two children have permission to remain in the State without conditions. If that is the case, the daughter is permitted to pursue a university course if she so wishes.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1173	An application for permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national was received from the person con cerned in September 2003. Applications of this type are dealt with in chronological order and currently take approximately ten months to process.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1174	The two persons in question, both Romanians, entered the State on 24 November, 1997 and claimed asylum. They were interviewed on 13 January 1999 and 2 February 1999, respectively. They attended further interviews on 30 March 1999 to clarify certain issues arising from the first interviews. Their claims were refused and they were notified of these decisions on 4 October 1999. They appealed these decisions to then appeals authority.Subsequent to the submission of the appeals one of the persons entered Northern Ireland illegally where he was arrested and detained. He made an application for asylum at Belfast on 30 September 1999. On 6 October, 1999 the United Kingdom requested this State to accept his transfer for determination of his application for asylum under the Dublin Convention. The request was accepted and the transfer was effected on 3 November 1999.The appeals in respect of the decisions of 4 October 1999 were held on 7 March 2000 and the persons were informed by letters on 19 October 2000 that their appeals were refused. In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, they were informed that it was proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and were given the following options: to make written representations within 15 days setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; to leave the State voluntarily; or to consent to the making of deportation orders. Representations were received as to why they should be allowed to remain in the State.The persons in question then instituted judicial review proceedings on 13 December 2000 on the grounds that the appeals authority failed to consider all evidence put before it and took irrelevant considerations into account. These proceedings were struck out on 17 July 2002. Applications for naturalisation were then made by the persons in question on 11 October 2002.I expect these case files to be submitted to me shortly and the persons will be informed of my decision in due course.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1175	The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 16 September 1999. His application was refused on 20 October 2000. On 9 October 2002 he applied for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered – but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport him. Representations have already been made by the applicant and these representations together with the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 will now be considered by the Minister. If, in the light of the foregoing, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order he will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.Due to the large number of such cases on hand, I am unable to say at this stage when the file will be examined.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1177	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a Garda investigation is currently taking place concerning illegal dumping on lands at Killegar, Enniskerry, County Wicklow. The complainant in this case is Wicklow County Council.The investigation is being carried out by members from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in conjunction with members from the Dublin Metropolitan Region. All aspects of the case are subject to investigation, including the ownership of companies allegedly involved in illegal dumping.A file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions at the termination of the investigation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1178	As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 241 of Thursday, 13 November 2003, the matters raised in the Deputy's question relate to an ongoing Garda operational matter and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in or comment further at this time.The Deputy should already know, however, that Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform do not interfere in Garda operational matters and most certainly do not interfere in the operation of the judicial process.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1179	The parents of the person in question have permission to reside in Ireland based on their parentage of an Irish born child. The visa application in question relates to their son who wishes to join them in the State.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of my Department does not generally approve visas in respect of such visa applications.

A request for tender and detailed technical specification documents is being drafted by the superintendent in charge of the telecommunications section at Garda headquarters. The Garda Síochána CCTV advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems, has not received any application to consider a CCTV system for the Kiltalown area.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	I am delighted that the Deputy has given me this opportunity to thank the gardaí in Tallaght for their continued best efforts and hard work. I also understand that at a public meeting on 10 November 2003, the gardaí were praised for their efforts at tackling public order issues and various other problems in the area.The neighbourhood Garda unit in Tallaght has a long working relationship with estate management committees. Community gardaí are in daily contact with the committees on issues of anti-social behaviour, drugs and general youth problems. Clinics are held each week with housing-estate management teams where the local community can discuss issues and report incidents. The gardaí, in conjunction with the estate management committees, also work closely with South Dublin County Council and, to date, this is proving very successful.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	There can be no excuse for illegal dumping activities and no effort must be spared in ensuring that our waste is managed in an environmentally appropriate manner. In this regard, all sectors of society, business, households, the waste industry and the government at central and local levels, have responsibilities and must play their part.I have clearly recognised, on many occasions, the importance of ensuring that the Governmental system plays its part, particularly in terms of achieving more vigorous enforcement of the waste code and I have already introduced a number of significant initiatives in this area.The Protection of the Environment Act 2003 provides for a range of strengthened waste-related enforcement provisions including significant increases in the fines for offences, up to a maximum of €15 million for conviction on indictment; reversal of the burden of proof in certain cases so that it will be up to the defendant to prove that an activity did not cause environmental pollution; a new provision through which landowners can, by virtue of certain factors, be deemed to be complicit in illegal dumping activities on their lands, unless the contrary can be proved; strengthening of the powers of, authorised persons, under the Waste Management Acts in relation to the stopping, inspection and detention of vehicles and the empowerment of the Garda Commissioner to appoint members of the Garda Síochána to be, authorised persons, ensuring that the powers under the Acts can be made available, speedily, to individual gardaí where necessary; extension to the EPA of certain powers available to local authorities in relation to the serving of notices and carrying out of remedial works – recovering the costs from the relevant parties, specific power for the High Court, when making orders in cases brought before it, to include, in orders for costs, provision for the recoupment of the costs incurred by the EPA in carrying out inspections, undertaking analyses, etc.; recognition, in law, of more modern and effective methods for the taking of samples and recording of evidence – video recording, tape recordings, etc.

While the amount in this subhead in 2003 was €44.662 million, it should be noted that the provision in 2003 included a budget of €1.5 million to support the implementation of the RAPID programme. This support budget is now shown in a subhead Q2 and therefore the real reduction in subhead L in 2004 is 2%.
