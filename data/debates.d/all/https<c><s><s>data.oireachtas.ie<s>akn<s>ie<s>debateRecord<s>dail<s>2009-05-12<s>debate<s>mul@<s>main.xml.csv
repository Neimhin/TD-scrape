#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.As a result of the supplementary budget on 7 April, my Department's 2009 Estimate has been reduced by €3.583 million over the Estimate published last October.  The reductions have been identified across several of the Department's administrative and programme subheads.  My Department's Revised Estimate for 2009 is €32.686 million which is a reduction of 22% on the 2008 further Revised Estimate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Why is there an increase of 10% in the allocation for consultancy services under subhead A7 given that the Minister for Finance announced last July that all expenditure by Departments and agencies on consultancies, advertising and PR was to be reduced significantly for the remainder of this year and by at least 50% in 2009?  There are significant increases in the allocations for office machinery and office premises expenses.  In respect of what are these increases?In his announcement on 3 February, the Minister for Finance said all Departments would be required to effect general administrative reductions in their budgets.  Where have these occurred in the Taoiseach's Department and to what do they amount?  Has there been any reduction in the staffing level in either the constituency or private office of the Taoiseach or the Ministers of State attached to his Department?The most significant expenditure is on the Moriarty tribunal.  The allocation has increased from €4 million to €7.5 million.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied this will be sufficient to meet the tribunal's needs given that it appears to be about to embark on another significant round of public hearings?  Has there been any communication between the tribunal and the Taoiseach on the likely extent of the resumed hearings?  Is there a likely date for the conclusion and publication of the final report?  When the Taoiseach last spoke about this on 3 March, he said the total cost up to 31 January 2009 was €34.91 million and that the figure for 2008 was €4 million.  The recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states that if one included third-party costs, which are uncertain and to which there is a high degree of contingency attached, the figure could be €100 million.  Has there been any recalculation of the total likely cost to the Department?Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to observe or read a number of newspaper reports published about two weeks ago, particularly in Sunday newspapers, on an important document in the possession of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in respect of which it held legal privilege for almost ten years?  It was suggested that because the draft report of the tribunal may have contained some critique of officials in that Department, the document was to be released to the tribunal, granted that it had not already been laid before it confidentially and was not mentioned in public hearings.Most people in the country are upset by many things that have gone badly in recent years but are further upset by the thought that a document that may have clarified serious matters for the tribunal was just sat on for ten years and is now to be the subject of extensive public hearings.  What is the Taoiseach's opinion on this?  What is the likely cost of the extra hearings?  The moneys spent on the tribunal tend to dwarf all the other expenditures under the heading pertaining to the Department of the Taoiseach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	With regard to the supplementary questions arising from the question on the Estimates, it is important to point out that there has been a reduction of 22%.  It is not true to say there has been an increase in PR or consultancy spending.  That is not correct.  In fact, consultancy provision in the Department's Vote in 2008, under subhead A7, was €275,000, and this has been reduced to €118,000 as a result of the Government's decision to cut consultancy costs by 50%.  Along with further budget day cuts, this results in a total reduction of 57% over the 2008 provision.  Every effort was made by the Department to minimise its budget in that area.  The consultancy provision in my Department's Vote, as I said, is quite small.With regard to the other savings, reductions of €3.583 million were obtained.  A total of €2.013 million in reductions will be made across the programme subheads in the Vote, while reductions of €170,000 will be made across administrative subheads.  For example, the National Forum on Europe will be closed, with a reduction of €1.853 million.  Other reductions across programme subheads include €110,000 for the National Economic and Social Development Office, €10,000 for commemoration initiatives, and €24,000 for the Ireland Newfoundland partnership.  These are in addition to earlier reductions across all subheads in last October's budget, resulting in reduced allocations in these subheads of at least 15% in each programme subhead and of 36% across the total programme provision in the Vote.  As a result of the Government decision of 8 July last regarding measures for expenditure control, substantial savings were achieved across the programme subheads through a combination of administrative efficiencies.  These savings will continue to be realised during the course of this year.A question was raised regarding the 10% reduction in private office costs.  Since taking office I have asked that all areas of expenditure in my private offices and those of the Ministers of State in my Department be reviewed to identify where savings could be achieved.  Staffing arrangements in my office have been reorganised, resulting in the redeployment of two members of staff, and I have asked that a reduction in overtime costs be achieved in the future.  I have also instructed staff to obtain better value in foreign travel, official entertainment and the range of administrative costs associated with the running of these offices through reviews of processes and procurement practices in order to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness.Regarding speculation about a document held by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the matter is best dealt with by the Minister concerned.  It is not intended to change the allocation that has been made available for the Moriarty tribunal this year.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In view of the general unease people are feeling about how the Government is running — or not running — the affairs of the country and the cost the tribunal has thus far incurred without ever producing an interim report, the possibility of further extended hearings in order to call back a collection of witnesses, particularly civil servants, is scary.  Given the importance of the Moriarty tribunal in the affairs of the nation, and the fact that the budget heading is specifically the responsibility of the Taoiseach in his capacity as head of his Department, he needs to comment on the increase in the Estimate from €4 million to €7.5 million, which is an increase of 87%.  He must be aware of the issue.  The suggestion that only the line Minister in the relevant Department would be aware of this is surprising, because I would have thought that, with regard to legal privilege, the Attorney General was also involved in advising on this document.

Can the Taoiseach give an idea of the revised cost of the Moriarty tribunal over and above the previous estimate of €100 million?  How long will the additional hearings take?  Does the Taoiseach have a date for the production of any kind of report by the tribunal, either interim or final?

He has used a different method from other tribunals in trying to avoid greater costs to the taxpayer in terms of how he has conducted that detailed, complicated inquiry.  I refer again to previous answers to specific questions on the matter.  I make the point that there is no change in the Estimate provision for this year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Exchequer figures published yesterday call to mind the words of the Minister for Finance on Monday, when he said the science of economic forecasting at present is imprecise, a bit like forecasting the weather, where there is such a variety of forecasts that the reality is we share a common analysis.  If that is the case, does the Taoiseach believe the Estimates published in respect of his Department will stand up to analysis?Has the Taoiseach established the criteria that will apply for the replacement of staff who might retire or move on?  Is there any indication of the numbers within the Department who might retire this year?  Will they be replaced?  Is there any assurance that public servants who take early retirement will not have their lump sums taxed?  If this matter is not conclusively addressed, it will quickly cause a brain drain and a loss of experience from all Departments.  It must be dealt with in a reassuring manner by the Taoiseach.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I answered the question about vacancies last week.  I referred the Deputy to the budget statement of the Minister for Finance, who outlined that it was not the intention at that time to tax those gratuities and he would refer back to the matter in December.On the question of the Estimates, they came in as scheduled last year and will come in this year.  It is a matter of controlling expenditure.  This is the money that is available and that has been passed by the Houses for these purposes and it would take a supplementary budget to change that.  I do not expect there will be a supplementary budget for the Department.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	10	What process is used within the Department to determine savings or cuts when such decisions are being considered?  We have seen a series of cuts across Departments and the public service, many of them unacceptable, certainly to Opposition voices and to many Government backbenchers.  Some of these decisions have had a negative effect on the public's opinion of politics as a whole, such as the HPV vaccine programme and the cuts in special needs education.  What process is used to make determinations?  Does the Secretary General of the Department highlight possible cuts and does the Taoiseach, as head of the Department, make the final determination?  Is the practice the same in other Departments or is the overall budget cut and then it is left to the individual Minister to determine how the Department's spending will fit into the overall sum allocated?  Can the Taoiseach give us a sense of how this process works?  Is the Cabinet involved in this respect?  Is there detail on these proposals?  Does the matter go to the Cabinet for a final decision to be taken on it?  Is it a collective decision of the Cabinet or is it left to the Taoiseach's Department and other Departments to make these at times alarming decisions?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I would like to make it clear to the Deputy that one has two options when in government.  One tries to bring about a situation where one's public finance position is sustainable or one decides that it is unsustainable, does not make any decisions and continues to borrow money at a rate that is not affordable over the period of time.  That is the position.One has a budget.  Limited resources are available to the State and there are priorities that have to be set out.  The Government has set out its budgetary position in great detail and it stands over those decisions.  Many decisions have to be taken which one would rather one would not have to consider but they have to be considered on the basis of the financial resources available.  That is the duty of Government.  The luxury of Opposition is to decry all decisions and suggest a painless alternative way forward where money can be obtained like manna from heaven or that one can continue with the provision of service levels that are simply not affordable in terms of the public coffers.  Alternatively, the Opposition can decide there are specific alternatives and put them before us.On the methodology of individual decisions that have to be taken, a bilateral Estimates process takes place between the Minister for Finance and individual Departments.  There are also Cabinet meetings, which take broader policy decisions.  Where further decisions are required in the aftermath of the bilateral Estimates process, the Government has to take those decisions.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I wish to ask a brief supplementary.  The picture the Taoiseach has painted is not clear.  The reason I ask this question is that I have never been in government and I am anxious and curious to know how these decisions are arrived at.  I base my line of questioning on what was abhorrent to Opposition voices in the House, that members of the Government and members of the Cabinet were apparently unaware of the detail of the decisions announced on 7 April or 14 October last, or were they just being smart-assed about it and pretending that they had not been consulted?  I ask the question again — are the decisions on the cuts in regard to specific Departments taken within the Department or are they decisions of the collective Cabinet?The Taoiseach mentioned that the Cabinet is involved in broader policy decisions.  In respect of the major decisions that have impacted so heavily and negatively not only in terms of public attitude towards the Government but — I believe I am fair in reflecting this — also against politics in general, which is clearly the position, are those decisions taken within Departments or is each Minister responsible for the cuts under his or her portfolio of responsibility?  How are those decisions determined?  Are the Secretaries General involved in such proposals?  Who comes up with the ideas and the instances I cited in my opening question in regard to the cancellation of the HPV vaccine?  Who dreamed up that proposal?   In regard to the decision on special needs education where some 500 children will be deprived of the essential supports they need in the classroom, who dreamed up that proposal?  I do not expect that the respective Ministers were the initial volunteers of these proposals but I could be surprised.  The Taoiseach might have another go at responding to this question.  I would be pleased to hear any further detail he would care to share.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As I was explaining to the Deputy, at the beginning of every budgetary process a bilateral meeting takes place between individual Ministers and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance will have obtained from Government broad agreement on the parameters of the budgetary strategy, based on the macro-economic forecasts and whatever other issues he can bring to the table as to what needs to be done.  Once this is achieved, the parameters are set and separate bilateral meetings take place between the Minister for Finance and individual Ministers.  In respect of every departmental Estimate there are officials in the Department of Finance who work on those issues all the time and they are the contact for officials from, for example, the Department of Education and Science, on issues of general administration.  They discuss the questions and a political discussion takes place between Ministers and officials on both sides.  In so far as agreement can be reached on the proposed Estimate, then agreement is reached.  Subsequently all these Estimates, once agreed, are put to Cabinet where they are agreed, adopted and published.  If there are further political decisions that need to be made to take account of the broad economic situation, or of any proposals from the Minister for Finance for budgetary measures or initiatives, these are also decided at Cabinet.  Taxation matters are the preserve of the Minister for Finance and this is how the budget works.The Deputy suggests there is a lack of commitment on the part of Government, for example, with regard to special needs education.  This Government has seen greater improvements in special needs education and quite rightly so because of the increased resources we were able to provide due to the success of our economic policies.  Adjustments now have to be made but there are thousands of special needs assistants in situ today who were not there before we came into office and there are thousands of extra teachers, thousands of new classrooms, thousands and millions of euro worth of new equipment ——

This is not to suggest that every problem has been solved but I do not accept the contention that this Government has not shown a very strong commitment in this area.  It has displayed a very strong commitment and one that is far stronger than the commitment shown by any previous Governments, precisely because more resources have been available.  The record will show this commitment and it will also show there are ongoing problems of administration which must be dealt with.  However, resources are finite and in the areas of health and education and social welfare we have sought to minimise the imposition of hardships but clearly the provision of service levels at existing levels or indeed improving them depends on obtaining certain flexibilities and certain new arrangements in terms of staffing and methods of operating and managing services.  This will be a continuing challenge for any Administration for the foreseeable future, given that we will need to get more for less because it is clear there will be fewer resources than was the case in the past.

Has the Taoiseach any figures for his own Department as to the number of civil servants wishing to retire early under the scheme and civil servants who have sought to take leave under the scheme announced in the budget?  Who will make the decision in the Taoiseach's Department and in other Departments as to whose retirement application will be accepted and whose will be rejected, perhaps on the grounds that the person is indispensable?

At the end of April this year the number of whole-time equivalent staff serving in my Department was 2,009.  We will endeavour to redeploy staff according to key business needs and activity levels; to restructure work loads as appropriate; and achieve greater productivity through exploiting new technologies and availing of shared service arrangements.  In 2008 staff savings were achieved in this manner by moving the operation of my Department's financial management system and associated transaction processing to the financial shared service centre of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Killarney.Further to the moratorium on recruitment and promotion, no vacancy arising in my Department will be filled except in exceptional circumstances with the express sanction of the Department of Finance as provided for in the Department of Finance circular.  This will necessitate reviews of how staff are deployed in the Department to ensure key areas of Department activity are adequately staffed.  The Department will endeavour to redeploy staff according to key business needs and levels of activity, restructure workloads as appropriate and achieve greater productivity through exploiting new technologies and availing of shared service arrangements.  The Department will adhere to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the public service.  No vacancies in my Department will be filled, however they arise, whether by recruitment, promotion or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade in accordance with the circular issued by the Department of Finance on 27 March.It is difficult to predict the numbers affected in terms of how many vacancies will not be filled arising from any further reduction in the Estimate provision for salaries because it depends on the timing and grade of any vacancies that may arise due to staff leaving the Department, whether as a result of retirement or any other reason.

He also oversees the preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  I have also assigned responsibility for the active citizenship initiative in my Department to Deputy Pat Carey.  The role of the Minister will be to drive the initiative forward, oversee the implementation of its recommendations and, critically, to promote the concept of active citizenship in all spheres of Irish life.  The Minister of State will be supported in this work by a steering group chaired by Ms Mary Davis.  My statutory functions relating to the Central Statistics Office have been delegated to the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey.In my Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  The committee keeps under review, and works to ensure coherence on, the full range of issues on the EU's agenda.  The committee has a particular focus on the correct and timely transposition of EU legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, also represents the Government at a wide range of EU and international meetings.  He plays a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's bilateral relations with EU member states.  He also plays a key role in communicating the importance of the European Union to Ireland, thus fostering enhanced public understanding of EU issues.  As always, questions on the functions of particular Ministers of State in other Departments should be tabled to the relevant Ministers.

Do both Ministers of State have delegated functions?  I assume the Chief Whip does, as very obvious duties are assigned.  In many other cases one gets the impression that Ministers of State are a bit aimless unless they have a nice senior Minister who allows them to do something.  Otherwise they are condemned to the graveyard shift in the Dáil where they handle Adjournment debate matters when they come in and read out a script, which, normally, only a couple of people have the pleasure of hearing.  It is the equivalent, in television terms, of being on "Oireachtas Report", if one were involved in its production.  As a Minister of State, one ends up reading prepared scripts that one has not even seen before entering the Chamber.  Are there delegated functions for all the Ministers of State recently appointed by the Taoiseach?Is the Taoiseach concerned that, in the way the appointments of the new line up of Ministers of State was handled, the fallout was very destructive of the image of smart——

There is no doubt that in the interaction of civil society with Departments and in the need to try to represent Departments at various meetings regarding policy formulation, in communicating strategy and listening to concerns at the most basic democratic level, all the Ministers of State are extremely busy people.  It does no service to the profession to suggest that in some way their job is a sinecure with no substance at all.With regard to the number of Ministers of State we now have I believe there is broad agreement that this number is appropriate in the present circumstances.  That was the Deputy's party's position so I presume she was not putting forward the idea there should be 15 Ministers of State who had nothing to do.  That sort of gratuitous comment is unfortunate.  It does not reflect very well on the profession nor is there any substance to the allegation.  It is a sarcastic cynical view of what Ministers of State do.The Ministers of State have been appointed and are settling into their Departments again.  In due course the statutory delegated functions of Ministers of State will be brought to Cabinet in coming weeks for final approval.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I agree with Deputy Burton that it is necessary that Ministers of State be given designated functions.  There is a need for a certain number of Ministers of State.  I would argue that the necessary requirement could be dealt with by appointing 12.  The Taoiseach made the reduction to 15.Ministers of State are appointed by the Government and that is governed by legislation.  Deputy Shatter produced a simple Bill by which, if the Government had adopted it, one might have enshrined in law the reduced number of 15, or, in my preference, to 12.  Does the Taoiseach intend to give legislative effect to the decision to reduce the number of Ministers of State?In his previous answer, the Taoiseach rightly referred to the necessity to make priorities where finite resources exist.  One of the problems with Ministers of State is the number of public servants employed in their private and constituency offices.  This appears to vary from office to office.  Everybody understands that a Minister of State needs some assistance to do his or her political work.  Has the Taoiseach set a limit on the number of public servants, paid for by the taxpayer, allowed to work in constituency and private offices?  Is the figure two or three or am I to understand that individual Ministers of State have different numbers, because that seems to be a sore point with the public?  While I fully respect that the Taoiseach is entitled to be able to service the needs, politically, of Ministers of State, when he speaks of finite resources I believe he should put a limit on this and let everybody know whether, for example, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has two people working for him in his constituency office.  In the event, let us not hear that the next Minister of State has six people working for him or her paid for at the taxpayer's expense.  Has the Taoiseach imposed a limit of two per Minister of State, and does the same apply to their private offices?I believe the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, deals with the question of integration, having replaced Deputy Conor Lenihan in that regard.  It does not appear, however, that there is to be any Government policy on integration and Deputy Curran has said he will focus on the drugs question, which obviously is important.  Equally, the sensitive question of integration is important.  In appointing the Minister of State with responsibility for integration, will the Taoiseach comment on his responsibility to continue to build and develop a fair policy of integration both for the Irish and immigrants.  He shall get some assistance in that regard from the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who is handing it down now to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The whole idea of Question Time is to get accurate information.  There is no better man to give accurate information on integration policy than the former Minister of State who has held that responsibility for a couple of years.Out of the 15 Ministers of State appointed, six have a primary responsibility in respect of a substantial area of the work of key Departments, and will have significant policy and management responsibilities in that regard.  Seven have responsibilities in respect of key cross-cutting issues, which require close co-ordination and, where appropriate, integration of policy and programmes across a number of Departments.  Those functions can and will be supported by appropriate interdepartmental structures at official level to provide a streamlined and coherent delivery of the Government's policy in these areas.  Finally, two Ministers of State, while having significant lead responsibilities in their own right, will also assist Ministers in the large and complex Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Education and Science.As the Deputy knows, I have ensured that Ministers of State will carry out their responsibilities with a reduced support team.  We have already taken steps to reduce by more than 10% the costs of running the offices of Ministers and Ministers of State.  Each has his or her portfolio and represents a significant and clear management brief.  Each represents a continuing and essential function of Government, which requires political attention.  Each Minister of State has a significant dimension of Oireachtas engagement, providing support for Ministers in busy Departments in carrying out full departmental responsibilities in addition to any delegated duties he or she will have, and an increased number of portfolios.  The Minister of State's office acts as a key point of co-ordination in respect of key policy objectives involving more than one Department.These are the issues that arise as regards Ministers of State and we should get away from the idea that there is little or no work to be done.  A great deal has to be done, and in my experience I believe each and every one of them is committed to doing the very best job he or she can do.

In his reshuffle of Ministers of State at the end of April, did the Taoiseach downgrade the focused ministerial drugs post from Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy to Minister of State with special responsibility for integration and community, with no reference to drugs in the title?  The dilution of the post happened weeks prior to the demise of the national drugs strategy team, NDST, and the expiration of its staff contracts, which had been already decreed by Government.Does the Taoiseach recall that the justification for the dissolution of the NDST was that a super-junior Minister with sole responsibility for drugs would be appointed?  Instead, the post regressed to its pre-2007 unfocused status.Alarming cases are daily described in the media of whole communities suffering at the hand of people in the, so called, drugs business.  Dolphin's Barn is a very recent case in point.  Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that against that backdrop, this decision is a worrying indicator of the Government's winding down of its previously stated commitment to press ahead with the implementation of the national drugs strategy and to combat head-on those responsible for the introduction and distribution of drugs throughout the country?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I do not agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin.  There is no question of downgrading the importance of dealing with the drugs issue.  The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Curran, continues to have that responsibility and has shown a strong commitment to the area and knowledge of it.  He is trying to ensure that money gets to those who require services and he does so in a far tighter budgetary situation than in the past.I do not agree with the Deputy's contention that the reorganisation of the responsibilities of Ministers of State was done with the intention of relegating the importance of the issue.  The Deputy who had this responsibility before the changes retains it because he has my full confidence with regard to it.  An interaction with him at Question Time and on other occasions will allow Deputy Ó Caoláin to dialogue with him on policy objectives and how he intends to implement them.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 puts in place a flexible framework for the licensing of digital terrestrial television, DTT, into the future.  The Act provides for the establishment of a free to air DTT service to replace the existing analogue terrestrial services offered by RTE, TG4 and TV3.  The analogue network is nearing obsolescence, is expensive to operate and results in an inefficient use of spectrum.  Analogue availability will cease in 2012.  The resultant availability of additional spectrum will yield a digital dividend which will give us economic and social benefits, such as the development of wireless broadband.The roll-out of DTT infrastructure is well advanced and RTE Networks Limited has built a network which includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  This represents the most difficult and costly part of the build plan.  The remaining building work will largely involve upgrading the country's minor transmitter sites to provide infill coverage and to ensure outlying areas in the west, north, north west and south, areas most reliant on the analogue terrestrial service, are also served by DTT, digital terrestrial television.The 2007 Act also provides for the development of commercial DTT services, which are anticipated to provide further choice to those who wish to avail of channels additional to the Irish free-to-air channels.  The Act provides for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to licence commercial DTT operators, as a matter of priority.  In this regard, the BCI ran a competition for three national DTT multiplex contracts in March 2008.  On 21 July 2008 the BCI announced its intention to enter into contract negotiations with Boxer DTT Limited for the award of the three national commercial DTT multiplexes.  On 20 April 2009 the BCI announced that Boxer DTT Limited had withdrawn from contract negotiations.The BCI subsequently approached the second placed applicant, the One Vision consortium, and has announced that it has now agreed to enter into contract negotiations with One Vision.  I welcome this development and look forward to a speedy and successful conclusion to these negotiations.  The BCI has confirmed that it is committed to pursuing the development of DTT services in Ireland as quickly as possible.  I emphasise the BCI is an independent body and that I have no role in its licensing process.  However, I am closely monitoring the progress being made.The United Kingdom has a schedule to switch off analogue television in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of digital terrestrial television.  Analogue services in Wales are set to switch off in autumn 2009.  This is likely to impact viewers along the south east of the country who currently receive overspill of the UK analogue terrestrial television channels.  Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected.  Both RTE and the BCI are aware of the situation in Wales and of the importance of providing DTT along the south-east of Ireland, as a matter of priority.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Since the Minister is taking two priority questions together I hope there will be real engagement on the issue rather than simply statements from both sides.  My party strongly supports DTT and we support the Government in its roll-out of DTT, including commercial DTT and free-to-air channels.  To give the impression that the pull-out by the Boxer consortium has caused nothing more than a need for the BCI to move on to the next best bidder, namely, One Vision, and to proceed as if there is no problem is totally misrepresenting the situation.According to its own targets, the Boxer consortium was due to roll out digital terrestrial television before this summer.  It has pulled out of a 12-year contract and the BCI is now undertaking negotiations with the next best bidder, One Vision.  People must know the position.  One Vision is made up of Setanta Ireland, Eircom and TV3, all good companies, but all of which are under severe financial pressure at present.  Does the Minister have confidence in the process?  Does he believe One Vision can now do what he expected Boxer to do considering the financing required for rolling out three multiplexes, or, will there be legal motions or a legal requirement to go to the next best bidder through the BCI?  Is this a realistic attempt to roll out commercial DTT through BCI negotiations with One Vision or are we simply going through the motions?  Will we be starting again in several months' time?My second question is specific and was not referred to by the Minister, although he should have done so.  What has taken place with Boxer has put Ireland under significant pressure.  Is is not true to say RTE has already spent the majority of the money it intends rolling out DTT infrastructure already?  It has spent €40 million to date and it anticipates that at least a further €60 million is required to provide DTT coverage throughout the country.  Will the Minister insist on RTE having three or four channels free-to-air on DTT by the end of the year in the absence of a commercial operator?  If he does so, would it make life financially impossible for RTE?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	46	To correct a detail, Boxer did not pull out of the contract.  It did not agree a contract with the BCI or RTE on the transmission side.  A contract was not ended, there was an inability to agree a contract.  That is a real concern and it is a pity.  Everyone would admit the timeline involved is not ideal and we did not wish for it.  We sought the signature of a contract and for the services to be in place quickly.  There was a welcome development.  However, at least in the process organised by the BCI there is a system where an alternative bidder may be approached.I have confidence in the process and I do not believe the companies involved are simply going through the motions.  There is no obligation on a second bidder or any other bidder to enter into such negotiations or to give an expression of interest.  However, I am not surprised it has done so because, I imagine, for each of the companies involved there is a very significant strategic benefit in terms of involvement in the new DTT services.Although the economy is in difficult straits and companies are in difficult times as a result, these are solid, profitable, effective, well-managed companies.  Arqiva is the fourth company in the consortium, which the Deputy forgot to mention.  This is its strategic business decision.  If I were in the telecommunications, broadcasting, or network services business, as these companies are, I would view this as a significant opportunity, and, therefore, I have every confidence.  Although I cannot be certain how the negotiations will proceed there is no question of a false confidence.  I am deliberately not involved in the licensing or contract negotiation process.  However, it is viable for us to move very quickly to get a DTT service.It is true that RTE is under financial pressure in terms of delivering DTT services.  The downturn in advertising has placed on RTE a real commercial difficulty, and this is the case with every other station at present.  However, everyone must face a fundamental reality in this process.  We will switch off the analogue system in 2012 because there is significant economic benefit for the country to remain on the path towards investing in a network to provide digital services and to switch off analogue.  We simply cannot turn back.  It would show a lack of vision in terms of the development of our spectrum on broadband and a whole range of other services.  Although it is difficult for RTE, and I fully accept it is in a very difficult position financially, we are fully committed to the network and to the ability to switch off by 2012.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It is regrettable that we find ourselves in this situation.  It is very important that whatever can be done is done to ensure we reach the important targets set by the Minister.  However, we must first consider the record.  The Minister is saying that if he were in that line of business he would be very excited to take on such a project.  However, a consortium with a good deal of experience in the area walked away from the contract, which it did not sign, after eight months.Why did the Minister and the BCI allow for such an extended period before it came to this regrettable conclusion?  When the announcement was made last July, the Minister stated that he was delighted at the speed at which the BCI has pursued this activity.  Will the Minister not take some responsibility for the fact that there was a long period of negotiation which ended up in the sand?  Will he assure us, in terms of his rather naive confidence in the process, that there is a deadline for the negotiations underway involving the BCI?  The statement made was that One Vision now has the licence.  However, it is accompanied by the rather large caveat that it is subject to contractual negotiations.  What is the deadline and what restrictions are in place to ensure we do not end up in eight or nine months time with an unholy mess on our hands because of a repeat of what happened before?  Has the Minister any concerns related to the Boxer withdrawal?  The quote recorded in respect of its decision was that is was due to prevailing and anticipated economic circumstances.  Does the Minister accept such circumstances prevail regardless of who takes up the contract?  Has the Minister carried out any assessment in terms of the likelihood of the ability of the second consortium to step up to the plate?

This autumn, people in my county, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's, are going to lose the benefits of the overspill they have enjoyed for 30 years.  The Minister has no control over that, but he has to deal with it.  Will he guarantee that those people will have access to the channels they currently enjoy?  Will he make that commitment?There is much confusion about the analogue switch-off, if indeed people understand anything about what is going to happen.  Will the Minister set up a public awareness forum to ensure that information is delivered to people who will be directly affected?

We have worked consistently on that.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	55	We have no set-top boxes now.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The contract negotiations were a matter for the consortium and RTE, and for the consortium and the BCI.  I regret that the negotiations were not successful, that they were protracted and that they did not lead to an outcome.  Since that failure became apparent, the BCI has been determined to proceed to a successful outcome.  It has set tight deadlines to see whether other consortia are interested.  At least we have a positive situation in that other consortia have said of their own volition that they are interested and they are entering contract negotiations.  I do not want to set a timescale for that other than to say I expect it will be a short period of months rather than a long one.It is in everyone's commercial interests to get out there with a service that still has a viable future in Ireland, as it does in every other country in Europe.  Without taking a line on one platform or means of providing the service versus another, I believe the option of digital terrestrial television has a future and that the Irish public will use it.  It is up to the commercial companies involved to decide on the contract arrangements.There is an issue about the loss of spillover that will occur later this year when the UK switches off its analogue system.  I have been particularly concerned about that, which is why I put time pressures on everyone on the issue.  This is a technical issue, but I understand there still will be a certain amount of digital spillover, albeit not on the scale of the analogue spillover.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Minister does not know how much there will be.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I do not have a map of the digital spillover, but I am told there will be a certain amount.  As I said in my first answer, the key development is that we have built the network that will cover that section of the country.  Subject to contract negotiations and agreement, it should be possible for us to get services up and running quickly so that the channels are available to people.  They will not get them in the same way as they do in the current situation, where they are free and the overspill exists on the basis of geography.  Obviously, the commercial multiplexes or whatever system is created under the final contract arrangements will charge for access to certain services, so the position will not be the same.  However, we must have our own digital terrestrial platform and I believe that will be achieved.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The regulation of ESB customer supply electricity tariffs and BGE gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.  The CER does not apply tariff regulation to large users of electricity or gas.  There is enough competition at the upper end of the markets to allow customers to receive competitively priced offers without the need for price regulation.  The majority of these large industrial and commercial electricity users are now supplied by independent suppliers.  Many of these large industrial consumers are on tariffs directly linked to commodity prices or single electricity market prices.  These companies have directly and regularly experienced the benefits of falling fossil fuel prices in recent months.I welcome the CER's decision to reduce regulated electricity tariffs by 10% and gas tariffs by 12% from 1 May following the first-quarter review of tariffs it undertook at my request in light of the economic circumstances and the decline in fossil fuel prices.  The commission's decision on electricity tariffs reflects the fall in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of sustained increases in oil, gas and coal prices.  The CER's decision on gas tariffs reflects the lower gas costs, exchange rate developments and increased sales during the winter months due to the particularly cold weather.  Under the regulatory regime, these tariff decreases would have taken place from 1 October.  There is still scope for a further reduction in gas tariffs from 1 October if wholesale gas prices continue to remain low.  The likelihood of a further reduction in electricity tariffs is limited.The CER is required to assess the costs underlying regulated tariffs to ensure they are fully cost reflective.  Energy prices have fallen by less than the overall fall in global fuel commodities because the CER took steps in 2008 to ensure that when international oil, gas and coal prices were increasing rapidly, customers were insulated from the worst effects of the spike in fuel prices.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The CER's approach in 2008 took account of the emerging difficulties in the economy and the negative impact of large-scale price increases on business and consumers, including vulnerable customers.  With the dramatic increase in gas prices, we faced potential electricity and gas tariff increases in the range of 30% to 40% from 1 October 2008.  In order to prevent such dramatic increases the CER decided to adopt a two-phase approach to its pricing process.  This involved a lower increase in the summer of 2008, which meant selling electricity and gas below the full estimated cost for that period.  These costs then had to be recovered in 2009, but the potential price increase was offset by falling gas prices and an ESB rebate of more than €300 million negotiated by the CER for all electricity customers.This approach meant that when fossil fuel prices were increasing exponentially in early and mid-2008, the CER decided on an increase of 17.5% in the price of electricity and 20% in the price of gas.  These increases were significantly lower than the wholesale price of gas would have suggested.  In contrast, some of our European neighbours saw much steeper price increases.The comparatively high energy costs in Ireland have been an acknowledged issue for the enterprise sector for a number of years, despite the overall relatively low energy intensity of Irish industry.  This concern has been exacerbated for business in the current economic climate.  A range of policy actions are underway that aim to mitigate energy costs in the medium term as well as reviewing all possibilities to reduce the extent of the price differential for the enterprise sector.  This work is of the utmost priority for my Department, working with the CER and all key players, in the very challenging economic environment for business.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	60	When the Minister leaves office and his record is assessed, this will be his biggest failing.  We are losing jobs by the week and international companies are openly saying they are leaving Ireland because of the cost of energy.  The 2008 figures from neutral assessors of Ireland's energy prices show that only Cyprus has higher prices than Ireland for industrial electricity.  Industrial electricity prices in Ireland have moved from being the European average to being 50% higher than that, and the position with household electricity prices is no better.  Only Italy has higher prices, and prices in Ireland have moved from being nearly 30% below the EU average to being almost 30% above it.  A great deal of this has happened on the Minister's watch.  The position with gas prices is not much more optimistic.There are specific things the Minister and the Government can do to reduce electricity prices and to ease the pressure on nursing homes that are turning off heating because they cannot afford the electricity bills.  Is it the Minister's agenda to keep electricity prices high in order to try to reduce usage and encourage energy conservation as part of the climate change agenda or is he serious about trying to bring down energy costs in Ireland?  A 12% reduction in gas prices between now and September is nothing like the reduction we need.   According to the CER, wholesale gas prices account for 60% of retail gas prices for households in Ireland.  Wholesale gas prices in the UK have gone from £1 per therm to 25p per therm in the past two weeks, but all we get is a 12% reduction in price.  On electricity, we are getting a 10% reduction in price, but the Minister misled the House today.  He said we are seeing a reduction in ESB prices because of a reduction in fossil fuel prices in the past year, but that is not true.  The ESB has said, and the CER will confirm, that the electricity price reduction this month resulted from the ESB reducing its network and transmission charges.  It has nothing to do with fossil fuel prices coming down.When will the Minister take seriously the issue of energy prices as well as his other agenda, which I support, on climate change?

We have introduced a single electricity market — an all-island system.  This gives a clear indication of what is happening and shows that prices are coming down due to a more competitive market with increased use of renewables and by having a Government which knows something about energy policy.  This means lower prices, more competition and clean supplies.

Competition is not working in Ireland, which is why, compared to other countries — our competitors — Ireland is becoming more expensive.  The party represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, should realise this and take the Minister in charge, if necessary, because his other agendas are resulting in job the closure of businesses that should not be closing and job losses.  Energy is too expensive in Ireland for both businesses and households.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I have read with considerable interest the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security on electric vehicles and I am grateful to members of the committee for their valuable contribution.  The recommendations made in the report are being considered in the context of our work to implement an overall strategy for electric vehicles.Much of the report resonates with the Government's strategic initiatives to ensure Ireland is ahead of the curve in the electrification of transport.  Together with the Minister for Transport, I have announced plans for the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020 will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads in the next 12 years.  This scale of deployment of electric vehicles will have a very positive impact in reducing carbon emissions and imported oil consumption in the transport sector.Initiatives to advance the strategy are under way.  The interdepartmental-agency task force is meeting regularly to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  It is chaired by my Department and comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, SEI, the ESB, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  As the Deputy will appreciate, good planning and preparation are vital to ensure our ambitious targets in this area are met.  Accordingly, the task force is developing the options and timeframe for putting in place the necessary infrastructure and other arrangements for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  We will also take full account of global developments as the technologies mature.  The task force will shortly report its initial findings and advise on next steps.Three working groups have been set up under the aegis of the task force, namely, the transport-infrastructure group, the fiscal group and the enterprise group.  The reports of these groups will critically feed into the task force's main report.  Employment opportunities, the costs involved in providing car charging infrastructure and all associated issues, including funding options, will be addressed in the report.The ESB and SEI have been working intensively as part of the task force and visited Israel and Denmark last year to study their approaches to fast-tracking the deployment of electric vehicles.  I am satisfied there is sufficient expertise available to the task force and in the key agencies to enable planning to be effectively achieved.The recently concluded memorandum of understanding with Renault-Nissan will ensure Ireland will be one of the first countries to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  This represents a major opportunity for Ireland.  Under the memorandum of understanding, ESB Networks will be able to avail of data on developments in electric vehicles which will inform our consideration of optimum infrastructure, support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.  The role of the Government is to develop and consider options for the establishment, operation and maintenance of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure network in Ireland, together with considering measures to develop a market for the vehicles.  The memorandum of understanding does not convey exclusive rights in the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers and I look forward to building relationships with all global players in the sector.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I hope the report is evidence that what the Minister said in response to our last exchange, namely, that my party was in some way seeking short-term political gain in the energy sector, is nonsense.  We strongly support a very aggressive and ambitious roll-out of electric vehicles.  I ask the Minster to accept that what he said in a heated exchange a few minutes ago was nonsense.  He can ensure cheaper electricity while at the same time pursuing an aggressive climate change agenda, a point he does not seem to accept.This is an all-party report.  Does the Minister accept the committee's conclusion that we should be talking to those in Northern Ireland, in particular the Northern Ireland Assembly, to try to pursue an all-island project for electric vehicles?  The situation will be very difficult in Border counties if we do not do this, particularly if there are hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and a proper charging infrastructure south of the Border but none north of theBorder.Will the Minister ensure those responsible for providing the tens of thousands of charging points which will be required in Ireland to facilitate electric vehicles on a grand scale, not just pet projects in different parts of the country, will ensure an open tendering process that will allow all companies which wish to tender for this business to do so?  Perhaps the ESB will win the tender competition because it has the capacity to do so — who knows?  However, we should not create a monopoly by stating the ESB should roll out this infrastructure.  We should open it up to public tender to ensure other companies will also have an opportunity to put the infrastructure in place.Will the Minister outline the membership of the task force, including the representatives from private industry?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I welcome the report of the Oireachtas committee which is progressive and in line with our thinking.  I also welcome the suggestion of close co-operation with Northern Ireland and agree with the Deputy that it makes sense for us to develop this as an all-island project.  As an island nation, we have an advantage in that there are certain distance limitations which mean that, as battery technology develops, it may be easier to deploy here than in Texas or some other location.In terms of supply company exclusivity, in all of what we are doing there are no exclusive arrangements.  While we have entered into memoranda of association with the ESB and Renault-Nissan, this in no way precludes other motor or supply companies which may wish to deploy the infrastructure.  It is important to recognise that having access to vehicles was a major step forward because we now know that in a very short timeframe of approximately two years, standard vehicles, including family cars, will be available.  It is also important that the ESB has committed to this and will create jobs in installing access points.  However, that is not to preclude another company applying on whatever basis with regard to the billing system and the power supply system chosen.I gave the list of members of the steering committee.  This is a Government initiative and it primarily involves departmental, agency and State company representatives.  That is not to stop bodies such as SEI which has a central role working with other private operators.  This is not an exclusive arrangement.  It is frontier technology.  With Israel, Denmark and Portugal, we are developing an infrastructure that has not yet been tried or tested.  It is a new infrastructure for the 21st century; therefore, this is only the beginning.  It will involve a huge number of companies and has huge economic potential for Ireland, a country that does not have any oil but does have significant renewable resources.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I apologise that Deputy Coonan is not present to take Question No. 64.  It is my fault, not his, that he is unavoidably absent.Question No. 64 withdrawn.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The provision of broadband is generally a matter for the service providers.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is responsible for regulating the telecommunications sector.  ComReg is charged with promoting competition, encouraging efficient investment in infrastructure and promoting innovation.Urban areas, because of the density of population, residential homes and commercial businesses, tend to be well served by competing service providers.  While no specific data is available on broadband services in urban areas, the combination of policy, investment and regulatory interventions has helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 62% of Irish households and 83% of Irish SMEs now have a broadband connection.It can be assumed that these penetration levels are higher in urban areas.  According to ComReg's fourth quarter key data report, 68% of business subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2–10 mbps range while 25% are in the 1–2 mbps range.  Some 60% of residential subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2–10 mbps range while 35% are in the 1–2 mbps range.  Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50 mbps, are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  For example, speeds of up to 24 mbps are available from DSL providers, 50 mbps products are available from fibre operators and 20 mbps products are available from cable operators.The competition that currently exists in urban areas has been facilitated by a series of policy, investment and regulatory interventions.  In addition, the Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to improve broadband coverage nationwide, with particular focus on the provision of high speed broadband in urban areas by way of the metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme.  Phase 1 of the MANs programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.  All 27 networks are operational and open for business.Under phase II of the MANs programme, 59 of 60 MANs which provide open access networks to 65 towns across the country are now completed.  It is hoped that the final network of the phase II programme will be completed in early 2010.  The phase II MANs, which are now complete, are available to service operators under an interim management arrangement.  A contract for a full management services agreement for the phase II MANs towns is expected to be signed shortly.  This will further enhance the potential for high-speed broadband in urban areas.More generally, the Government is committed to universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I thank the Minister for his response.  I concede that the number of people accessing broadband in Ireland has continued to increase.  However, we face a huge challenge in terms of providing the next generation speeds required by companies, first and foremost in urban centres, if we are to be competitive with other countries.I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Is the management contract in place yet for MANs phase II?  If not, why not?  We have been waiting for almost a year now, since the preferred tender was chosen, E-Net.  The Minister made a number of commitments last year following his consultation paper on next generation networks and their delivery.  He said there would be open access fibre connections in place for all new buildings in Ireland.  Is that happening?  It was to happen by the end of last year.  The Minister said there would be open access to all State-owned ducting infrastructure to lay fibre and that this would be available at an affordable price for companies.  Is that happening?  I am not aware it is.  He said the target for schools was 100 mbps.  What progress has been made on that since and how much State money is being spent on it?  These questions relate to announcements the Minister has made, but on which he has not followed through.  Perhaps he will give us an update on the situation now.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I appreciate the Deputy's earlier comments and agree with him on the need for high-speed broadband, which will be crucial infrastructure for the development of our economy.  It is important to remember that 70% of houses have a computer and this is one of our difficulties.  We need to expand not just our broadband but the whole digitalisation of our economy and society and to continue to ramp up speeds.I expect the management service contract to which the Deputy referred to be signed and concluded within a short number of weeks.  The reason for the delay is simple, namely to ensure we get value for money for the taxpayer.  It is an extensive, detailed and lengthy 15-year contract and——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	92	In the meantime some €80 million of investment money lies unused.  How does that represents good value for money?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The contracts will be signed with an eye to the taxpayer's interest to ensure good value for money.  The only reason for the delay is to get it right for the taxpayer.In terms of next generation networks, the Department is working at full stretch in terms of how to deliver open access fibre in our planning regulations.  It is working with the National Roads Authority, the rail companies and other State bodies to map out our State ducting and is working with the telecommunications industry to see how best we can provide these networks on a local access basis.  We are committed to that and working towards it.The situation is similar with regard to schools' broadband.  I see this as one of the most crucial developments.  We are renegotiating and re-entering into contracts catering for the 4,000 schools that have broadband.  We will return with improved broadband and are looking at specific schools where we intend to ramp up immediately — this year — to 100 mbps.  I hope to announce details of that shortly.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Minister did not reply on Deputy Coveney's question on the MANs II project, which is crucially important in my constituency.Currently, backhaul speeds are appallingly slow and getting slower daily.  This is a major challenge for small businesses throughout the country.  The State owns a web of broadband fibre throughout the country.  In my parish there are three separate broadband cables owned by the State within 500 yards of each other, but none of them are connected up.  We still do not have a map of where these networks are — unless the Minister has such a map — or information on the connectivity or lack of it between the State agencies that own this fibre.  I cannot get my hands on such a map.  The Minister has spoken about going a step further with regard to State-owned ducting, but we do not have a national map available of the State-owned fibre.  If we had, we could at least see what the challenge was in that regard.  When will we see open access and connectivity to the fibre network that is already in State control and when will we see an improvement in the backhaul speeds?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	95	In terms of backhaul, there is State-owned infrastructure in use that is effective and offers very fast backhaul speed, for example, the like of the ESB or CIE networks being used to provide backhaul.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Much of that is dark fibre.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Existing State infrastructure is being used in that fashion.  In terms of developments since we published the paper last year, I should have mentioned earlier some of the real developments on the ground.  We have a ship steaming towards Ireland currently to lay a cable connecting Ireland to North America, Project Kevlin, which will run from the north west around to the east coast and provide further high speed international connectivity and backhaul connectivity in this country.  Therefore, real investments are being made.  Multi-million significant investment will continue to provide high speed backhaul services, but we need to go further.  The volume of traffic and the needs and demands as we go on YouTube, mobile phones and use ever more data at home and view television and other materials on-line mean we will see significant increased ramping up.  That will bring into use our metropolitan area networks.  It will require us to use the National Roads Authority network, the An Bord Gáis and RPA networks and other State ducting, be it in sewers, waste pipelines or whatever infrastructure.

I presume he is now very familiar with how it has worked out in different parts of the country.  With regard to the MANs project in Wexford, will the Minister indicate the extent of the take-up among customers?  Is the Minister aware there has been a very low level of customer take-up and that the charges on these customers is very high?  Taking Wexford as an example, will the Minister tell us what the experience has been with regard to take-up and costs for individual customers?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I expressed concern for technical reasons.  There was real difficulty about how to provide the last mile access and the backhaul.  I always acknowledged that these were long-term investments and that the fibre on open access would be widely used and that is starting to happen.  I do not want to refer to any particular commercial contract because there are a series of new customers going onto the MANs but one of our largest mobile telephone companies is making a statement for the future by entering into a detailed contract with a management service company on those first phase MANs to start providing that last mile access and link into the MANs.  These are long-term investments and such is the speed and increase in data traffic volumes ahead of what anyone expected that the fibre network will be a major long-term asset.  That is starting to happen.There are still difficulties.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 108 together.Following the 2009 budget day announcement on 14 October 2008 on the rationalisation of State agencies, the Government has now formally approved proposals for the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector, which include the creation of a single strengthened national inland fisheries authority to be known as inland fisheries Ireland.  This authority will replace the existing central and seven regional fisheries boards.  Given the nature of its work the new authority will of course continue to have a strong regional presence.A restructuring implementation group, which includes representatives of the central and regional fisheries boards, has been established and is developing the key features and structures of the model.  Primary legislation is required to bring about this restructuring and in this regard a draft heads of Bill has recently been approved by Government.  It is expected that the legislation will be published in late summer, be progressed through the Oireachtas later this year and that the new authority will be in place before the end of 2009.The Department has recently circulated, through the fisheries boards, details of the draft heads of Bill and proposals for the restructuring of the sector to board members, management and staff of the central and regional fisheries boards and to other interested stakeholders.  This information is also available on the Department's website.  There has been no response to date to the documents circulated.I am confident that the restructuring will result in an organisation better equipped to serve the needs of the inland fisheries sector.

I welcome the fact that there is somebody in charge.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	124	That it was not included in his title, however, showed the low status of the issue in the Department.  The Minister of State must be aware that this is the second time that the heads of the Bill have been presented to Cabinet.  Is he saying that although the legislation will not be taken until the autumn session it is realistic to presume that the new structure will be in place before the end of the year?  There was nobody more critical of the deferral of elections than the Minister in 2007 when he spoke harshly about a predecessor, yet he is presiding over ongoing postponements of elections.How much money will this restructuring save?  What are the staffing requirements of this new structure?  Will there be a voluntary redundancy scheme and what does it mean for senior staff within the existing regional boards?  What are the savings in respect of accommodation?  There was a proposal to decentralise to Carrick-on-Shannon and a history of serious waste of money on accommodation for the Central Fisheries Board.  Will the Minister of State outline exactly the financial benefits of this proposal and how it will streamline the structures and accommodation needs?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Much of the structure and architecture of this area originated in the rod licence dispute which raged across the country for a long time and was resolved by the late and much lamented John Wilson.  We are rationalising the boards because we are under a standing instruction from the Department of Finance to consider State agencies.  The Fine Gael Party has made much of this push to remove or reduce the numbers of quangos or boards of one kind or another.  This is my Department's contribution to the process.  I am confident that we will put this new authority in place and that it will be up and running before the end of the year.  That does not mean that people will lose their jobs.  The heads of the Bill give specific statutory protection to some of the people working in the sector and for these boards.  It is sensible and timely to remove the regional authorities and centralise them in one particular board.  The board's membership will be reduced from 160 to ten.  That is one saving that can be achieved.  Having a proliferation of boards and agencies organising board meetings at seven regional locations throughout the country uses up a lot of the time of fisheries management officials.  The change will save €300,000.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I have never heard such waffle.  I asked a specific question and while I appreciate that the Minister of State is new in the job, that is a disgraceful answer.  If he is serious about streamlining Government and getting value for money the Minister of State needs to do better than that.  Has nothing been learned from the setting up of the Health Service Executive?  It started from the same base of amalgamating all the health boards to provide better value for money but we ended up with more money being wasted and a monster that does not seem to be able to manage its affairs in any way conceivable as good government.  How much will be saved and what is the situation as regards staffing and accommodation and what will happen to the savings?

We have identified a saving of at least €300,000 in respect of the reduced board membership.  Further savings will follow and I will be delighted to update the Deputy on them as they accrue.  The move to Carrick-on-Shannon is on hold in line with the decision to put all of the decentralisation project on hold.

We are trying to streamline it by creating one single authority.  The intention is that it will report to me, as Minister of State.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	130	We had a heated discussion at the end of last year when the Minister brought forward a proposal to postpone again the elections for the positions on the fisheries boards.  We were told at the time there was an absolute commitment that the new legislation and the new board structure would be in place by August this year.  The Minister of State is now telling us he hopes to have the legislation in place by the end of the year.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The Minister of State should inform himself because it is not up to the boards to make the decisions; it is he who must postpone the elections.  It is part of secondary legislation and it is important that the Minister of State appreciate this.  Does he not accept that there is disappointment about this matter?  There are claims that the Government will streamline the system and ensure better value for money, yet, at the same time, the Minister of State is saying there will not be any reduction in staff and that the offices will remain open.  I presume there will have to be new offices to accommodate the new structures and that new staff may have to be taken on.  That is the experience for which the Minister of State has been partially responsible in setting up the HSE.  It proved to be a very costly exercise in so-called restructuring.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take this on board.

Clearly, it would not be desirable to have elections to the bodies in question.  The new authority, the remit of which will be to manage the inland fisheries resource, will be in place by the end of the year.  To answer Deputy Stanton's question on industrial relations issues which I did not answer in full, such issues will naturally arise in respect of regional boards which are being abolished, given that the chief executives and other members of staff will be mindful of their positions being extinguished.  It iin this area that the industrial relations difficulties will arise.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	142	There are a number of very pressing issues with which the House should deal.  Yesterday Allied Irish Banks issued an interim management statement ahead of its annual general meeting tomorrow.  The developments alluded to in the statement are extremely disturbing.  The bank now expects its bad debt charges for 2009 will be of the order of €4.5 billion.  Loans that are vulnerable, on watch or impaired have increased in the first quarter of the year by €9 billion up to €24.3 billion.  Mortgage arrears are rising and now stand at 2% of the total book.The banking sector is deteriorating day by day.  Just two months after the detailed analysis of its loan book, Allied Irish Banks is now stating its outlook is even worse than the worst case scenario it envisaged.  It stated last year it did not have any problems at all, but we now find ourselves in extreme uncertainty and danger.  If this is mishandled or got wrong by the Government, it will have the potential to sink the economy entirely.  On the basis of well accepted assumptions internationally, the IMF estimated that, on the basis of the Government's policies, the cost to the taxpayer of bailing out banks could be as high as €24 billion, which sum would not be available for schools, hospitals, education, policing or the next generation.  This would obviously be a disaster of unprecedented proportions.  The response of the Government has been dictated to date by the needs of the bank, without great regard to taxpayers or their customers.Consider the decision to save Anglo Irish Bank last September, at which time we were not told the full truth that there had been a massive run on the bank.  A decision was made to recapitalise it when it was obvious to all that its business model was broken and that it had lost the trust of regulators, depositors and the public.  The decision to invest €7.5 billion in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland which allowed for the nursing of dodgy developer-related debts without any credible commitments to extend credit to the hard pressed and struggling small and medium enterprise sector and the latest decision, on foot of a short report, to buy €90 billion worth of unsellable toxic property debt from the banks, to be managed by the State, were made, although virtually every single economist not on the Government's payroll had said this was the wrong direction in which to go.  Who or what is dictating policy?  Is it the banks or the public interest?  For whom or what has the Government more respect?  Is it the banks, the international bond markets that funded the banks or the taxpayer?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I will comment responsibly in reply to some of what the Deputy has had to say.  I make it clear to him, as we have always done, that it is the public interest and no other factor which motivates the Government in this matter.  Any suggestion to the contrary is just fanciful on the Deputy's part.  The Opposition contends continually during the course of the election campaign that this is about bailing out banks.  It is important to point out that it is not about bailing out banks but about trying to help those who depend on the banking system, including Irish businesses and individuals who require credit to conduct their affairs.  Thus, we need a working banking system.  The European Commission has approved the recapitalisation in the proposal we put to it in accordance with the EU guidelines that have been set out.  The issue of trying to ensure funding for our banking system is based on the need to put our public finances in order and to ensure we provide the right policies in our general banking system, and that is what we have been doing.  I reject the suggestion by Deputy Kenny that there is some way of dealing with the issue of impaired assets without actually identifying them and putting them somewhere else.  The uncertainty created in the market due to the size of these impaired assets is hindering the normalisation of credit availability in the Irish banking system.  Far from not introducing proposals and making decisions, the Government is determined to do whatever is necessary to assist.  The setting up of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, is a similar model to that used in other parts of the world where there have been banking crises in the past.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I have never attempted to impugn the Taoiseach's integrity, but his understanding of the public interest is in question here.  He is right in stating that such systems have been used in other places.  I assume he has studied, for example, what happened in France in the mid-1990s when a similar agency was set up to acquire €28 billion of toxic assets and €18 billion in capital was lost as a consequence.  If we make a similar calculation for Ireland, we could be talking about a loss of €33 billion if we continue with the NAMA project the Government appears intent on carrying out.In the context of the public interest, I ask the Taoiseach, as head of Government, to stop and think about the interest of the Irish taxpayer before he goes too far down this road.  Based on the figures, which have been assessed at €90 billion, we could well be exposing the taxpayer of the next generation to a further €70 billion in debt, and we may well find at the end of the process that there is little to recover.  In recognising what the problem is, it is possible to deal with it without creating another problem in the form of NAMA.  Why will the Government not consider what Deputy Bruton has been proposing on behalf of Fine Gael for quite some time?  We should invest in clean banks with no toxic assets which would be considered by international markets and other financial agencies with a degree of trust.  In this way we could avoid exposing the taxpayer to a potentially catastrophic and devastating economic future.The Government is going down a very dangerous road in proceeding with the recommendation on NAMA.  The figure of €90 billion that has been arrived at for all loans given by guaranteed banks to developers may well expose the taxpayer and future taxpayers to an additional national debt of €70 billion.  That would be unforgivable.  For the sake of the public interest — which is what we are all focused on, although the Taoiseach may have a different version of it from me — is it not possible for the Taoiseach to stop and think before he goes down this road?  We should invest whatever resources the State has in clean banks that will attract further finance and allow credit to flow to businesses, which, as he has agreed, are the economic lifeblood of our country and important for our future.  This is a critical decision for the Government to make, and the recommendation of Fine Gael is that the State should invest its resources in clean banks rather than allow this potential catastrophe to face the already beleaguered Irish taxpayer.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	145	As I have said to Deputy Kenny already, the purpose of transferring the banks' impaired assets to NAMA is to allow the banks to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce the uncertainty regarding the level of bad debt held by them.  This should in due course allow banks to provide credit to the economy on a commercial basis, which is necessary as there is currently no functioning market for those assets.  In the absence of market-generated values, a valuation method will be put in place to establish the appropriate values of the assets transferred to NAMA.  The Deputy has been bandying about figures for book value, although of course there would be major discounts on valuations taken by banks and by those who own the debts.

It is a key priority for Government to ensure we have a robust and consistent approach to valuation.  The European Commission has provided guidance to member states on the treatment of impaired assets, including a detailed set of requirements for the valuation of such assets and, as set out in this guidance, the valuation of the assets transferred to NAMA will be certified by an independent expert and validated by the supervisory authority.  The commission will have an expert valuation panel involving the European Central Bank to assess the valuation methods of all member states.  We are working within the guidelines set out by the Commission with regard to impaired assets.  A recognition——

That is the purpose of our method of dealing with this issue, which is in line with the guidelines set out by the EU.

It is clear the attempts made to date have not succeeded.  Business is not getting the credit it needs.  Good businesses which would have a future if they could survive the recession cannot now get credit to act as a bridge in this difficult period, to protect the jobs of their workers and to stay in business, even after a succession of attempts by Government to ameliorate the situation.  It is clear that the unqualified guarantee of the banks has not succeeded.  Recapitalisation is now at €8.5 billion, which includes an extra €1.5 billion for the bank that announced yesterday it has a significantly higher level of bad debt than it had forecast two months ago.  The book value of all the toxic assets is €90 billion, but even conservative estimates are putting the cost at anything between €24 billion and €30 billion.  No matter where one pitches it, it is an astonishing level of debt to be building up not just for today's taxpayers but for our children and, possibly, our grandchildren to pay back in decades to come.There is an alternative, which is contained in the motion the Labour Party has proposed for debate in Private Members' business tonight.  It is that the banks be temporarily nationalised, cleaned up and put back in order.

We have two choices.  We can go down the route suggested by the Government, with the guarantee, recapitalisation and then the buying up of the toxic assets and bad debts by an agency announced five weeks ago that is yet to be established and for which no legislation has been introduced, and about the status and size of which we still know very little.There is, however, a choice facing the House and the Government — the Government way or the way contained in the Labour Party motion.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that, given all that has happened, and that the steps taken to date to deal with the banking crisis have not succeeded, he should now bow to the inevitable and agree to the proposal the Labour Party is putting tonight, that the banks be taken into public ownership for the period necessary to clean them up and get them back to order?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The motion put forward by the Labour Party offers no solution to the banks' bad debt problem.  It focuses entirely on the ownership and governance of banks; there is no proposal on how to clean up banks' balance sheets.  Banks with damaged balance sheets, whether they are private, partly State-owned or fully nationalised, will not lend to the real economy.  Moreover, bank nationalisation does not improve the access of banks to funding but would likely make external funding more challenging.International experience shows that the cost to the taxpayer of banking crises rises quickly over time unless bad loans are dealt with and developers with troubled projects and the bankers who funded them are likely to gamble in that respect.  In the case of a nationalised bank they are gambling with taxpayers' money.  That is why a standard tool for dealing with bad loans is to establish an asset management company to separate out the questions of the developers and the bankers.  The asset management company acts in the interest of taxpayers.  This approach has been used successfully in resolving banking crises in the United States and Sweden in the early 1990s and in several eastern countries during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.Deputy Gilmore seeks to quote an eminent economist in this area but one of the top banking economists in the country, Professor Honohan, told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 6 May that under State ownership banks might be under pressure to provide finance to failing firms that have no prospect of repayment.  He went on to say it would be a catastrophe for the public finances if, on top of what has been done by the banks and the regulator in regard to the property bubble, a large new wave of unrecoverable loans was made.  He also said that one cannot ignore the extensive international evidence showing that Government-owned banking systems serve their economies poorly, tending to result in higher interest rate spreads, less private credit and the credit there is going to larger firms.Greater state ownership has long been associated with more crises.  The only country to engage in wholesale nationalisation of its banks in the current crisis is Iceland.  Is that what is being suggested — that we should follow that model?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The only other country that has anything remotely close to such a difficulty is Ireland.  All of the international commentators, including the IMF, are telling us that the cost to the taxpayer, to the public and to future generations of dealing with the banking crisis will be greater here than it will be anywhere else.  We have a crisis.  What the Government is doing is not working, it is costing more and more.  The money we should be committing to building our schools, hospitals and infrastructure, providing broadband and doing those things a growing economy will need in the future will now be committed to sorting out the banks.First of all they got €8.5 billion upfront for recapitalisation and God knows now how many billion the Government will spend buying up the bad debts.  If the Government overestimates the amount it pays, and it has mentioned discounting them, we will pick up the tab.  If it underestimates it, the banks must deal with it, meaning they will come back looking for more money from the State.  Either way the public must pay for it.The Taoiseach can quote one economist who supports his position.  There are 20 economists, from a range of opinion, not all of whom would support the Labour Party by any stretch of the imagination, who are all saying that the sensible thing to do now, the most cost-effective way to deal with the banks in the interests of the public is to nationalise them for a period and to bring them into public ownership so they can be restored to good order before putting them back on the market.This is not an ideological decision or a position taken in the past.  It is a more sensible and cost-effective way of dealing with the problem than what the Government is doing, pumping money it does not have, money that must be raised from future generations of taxpayers, into the banks in a blind attempt to get them out of the hole they are in and, in the meantime, the banks are not functioning as they should in a good economy; they are not providing the credit, lending and good facilities ordinary businesses need to keep going with the result that businesses are going to the wall and jobs are being lost.I agree with Deputy Kenny.  This is about more than the expression of political positions, this is about the public interest and in the public interest I appeal to the Taoiseach not to stick with the position he has taken until now on the banks.  I believe that he will eventually come to the position advocated now by the Labour Party and the sooner he comes to that position, the better it will be for the country, for business, for banks and for economic recovery.

The Deputy's proposal does not deal with the funding or bad debts issues.  It deals with ownership.The question is what is best to do in this situation.  There is a continual effort to portray Government investment as bail outs for the banks.  We are in the business of trying to help those who depend on banks, we need a workable banking system.  I know the traction and resonance candidates can get on the doorsteps when suggesting this is about bailing out banks.  This is about trying to bail out the Irish economy, trying to save the Irish economy by having a proper banking system.Certain decisions had to be made to do that in terms of the scale and magnitude of the challenge that faced us.  When we introduced the bank deposit guarantee, it stopped banks collapsing because people could safely leave their deposits in place.  Other countries followed but the Labour Party opposed it in this House.

Independent board members were appointed that will oversee the transition from the structures of the past to a new approach.  The recapitalisation is occurring in a way similar to the approach in most countries.  Money is being invested in bank recapitalisation and I remind Deputy Gilmore there will be an 8% return on that investment.

The Labour Party proposal does not address that issue and does not wish to address it because it does not suit it ideologically in the context of the coming weeks.The Deputy is suggesting to this House that the nationalisation of the banks will solve the problem.  That is not the situation, the risk to the taxpayer will be increased.  We have always said that is a matter of last resort.

Prosper Fingal provides an extensive range of services to 233 people with intellectual disabilities in north County Dublin.  To date the Minister has reduced the budget by 3% and indications show that no funding will be provided for service development this year.  If the Minister withdraws the service development funding, 24 people who depend on the services of Prosper Fingal will be devastated, as they will lose their long-term service placements and will be sentenced to spending their lives at home with their family supports.

What plans have the Government to introduce legislation to prohibit the use of sunbeds by under 18 year olds?  It was signalled this would be addressed as part of the public health (miscellaneous provisions) Bill but, as the most recent Government programme of promised legislation indicates, as yet there is no indication when that Bill will be published despite it having been on lists of promised legislation for years.  What is the prospect of that Bill being brought forward or will the Government consider, given the serious and worrying statistics in regard to skin cancer cases, bringing forward that element of the promised legislation as a stand-alone Bill to address this issue as a matter of urgency?

The first relates to the ongoing non-legislative performance of the Department of Education and Science and I ask that he might raise this again with the Minister.  There are three Bills outstanding but there is no progress no them.  One of the Bills relates to the George Mitchell scholarship scheme and the Taoiseach may have attended a reception yesterday evening on that matter.  We are still standing exposed and shamed by refusing to put our money where our mouth is in that regard.More pertinently, I refer to the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  When will the legislation for that referendum be brought before the House?  I presume it will be brought before the House this side of the summer recess.  Will the Tánaiste, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach, be in a position at some stage later this week to indicate what legislative proposals she will be bringing forward to ensure that the contentious matters of labour legislation in domestic law will be resolved so that it is not an obstacle at domestic level in this Republic and not relating to the Viking case or the Laval case or other matters dealt with at Commission and the European Court of Justice?

Given the turmoil we have seen in the global financial markets and the dramatic contraction in economic output world-wide, there is a natural caution and reticence about forecasts of recovery and there is considerable uncertainty about the sustainability and strength of that recovery at this stage.  At present, global economic output is continuing to contract and it is accompanied by falling world trade.  According to the IMF, the advanced global economies — which constitute Ireland's major trading partners — are predicted to contract by 3.75% this year, which will weigh upon our export performance.  The depreciation of sterling has been unhelpful for our indigenous exporters.However, policymakers around the world have responded to the financial crisis with marked determination.  There are signs now that these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.  In the past week, the world's leading central bankers have noted improvements in business and consumer sentiment while some important indicators in key economies have shown tentative signs of stabilisation.  When it emerges, the recovery will, in all likelihood, be slower in Europe than in the US.  Nevertheless, these tentative signs of stability underscore the importance for this country of continuing to pursue the policy path set by the Government to guide the economy and position it to benefit from a global recovery.GNP is projected to contract by 8% this year.  A more moderate decline is expected in 2010, but as the international recovery gains momentum and the sharp shock in residential housing output passes through, our economic growth rate is expected to turn positive by 2011.  Though the challenges are great, we should not forget that our economy has many strengths on which to build a recovery.  Our labour force continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  We are continuing to invest in education at all levels in order to ensure we have the skills demanded by our knowledge-intensive economy.  The Government remains committed to providing a pro-enterprise environment and to maintaining our relatively low tax burden on business.  We are ensuring capital spending remains at a high level by international standards.  This will allow us to maintain our investment in productive infrastructure which will help enhance our competitiveness.Our economy also remains flexible and resilient.  Labour costs are falling in both the public and private sectors.  This adjustment is painful and I do not for one minute underestimate the difficulties it is causing workers and their families.  However our capacity to make these adjustments in labour costs and work practices is critical to our recovery.  The sacrifices we make now will reap large economic gains in the near future.  Our agility in responding to this most difficult of economic crises has been acknowledged by Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the eurozone Finance Ministers.  Just two weeks ago, Mr. Juncker said Ireland is "making some very brave efforts and we very much welcome the feeling of national consensus that we detect in Ireland and we take our hats off and pay tribute to the Irish people in rising to the challenge and bearing the sacrifices that the Government is asking them to make".Both Mr. Juncker and Commissioner Joaquín Almunia endorsed our recent supplementary budget as the correct approach to our economic and fiscal difficulties.  The purpose of the supplementary budget was to restore order and stability in the public finances so that we can protect existing jobs and generate the essential economic confidence that will lead to further employment creation and a return to prosperity.This Finance Bill, in giving effect to the supplementary budget measures, addresses the two important requirements of showing a credible way forward on our structural problems while protecting our economy.  Our approach must be rooted in a determination to put the economy on the road to renewal.  We must demonstrate that we have the ability to make the right choices for everyone in this country, choices that will not only determine our immediate economic future but also our long-term future.We must never lose sight of the principle that economic and fiscal renewal cannot be achieved at the expense of fairness.  It is essential that each of us contributes according to our means.  Tax increases are required.  They are not palatable, nor are they easy to accept, but the measures detailed in this Bill are progressive and fair.I note the comments of the ESRI in its recent quarterly review about the redistributive impact of the budgetary measures we have taken since my appointment as Minister for Finance.  The institute's study shows that those on the lowest income levels fare best from the combined effects of the October and April budgets.  The Government will continue to protect the vulnerable in this difficult period but in doing so it must be borne in mind that we all have a responsibility to accept a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in this economy.If we are to address the fiscal challenge we face it will be necessary to significantly broaden our tax base.  To advance this I announced in my supplementary budget speech that I was terminating property-related accelerated capital allowance tax relief schemes in the health sector to help broaden the tax base.  As Deputies are aware, all such schemes are now being terminated with the exception of the specialist palliative care units and child care facilities.This Bill sets out the transitional arrangements for the pipeline projects affected by the termination of property-related capital allowance schemes announced in the budget.  The schemes being terminated cover private hospitals, nursing homes including associated residential units, convalescent homes and mental health hospitals.  The estimated annual saving from the termination of these schemes is approximately €60 million in a full year.I am satisfied that the transitional arrangements strike a balance between the requirement for the Minister for Finance to terminate remaining property-related capital allowance tax reliefs and a recognition that the schemes cover large-scale projects which have a long lead-in period involving design and planning work which can be expensive.  The Bill also gives effect to the budget day announcement of the abolition of the special 20% tax rate applicable to trading profits from dealing in or developing residential land.  The income will now be charged at the individual's marginal income tax rate or at the 25% rate of corporation tax.  There will also be a restriction on the relief of trading losses incurred from dealing in or developing residential development land.  The proposals relating to dealing in or developing residential land represent another significant step by the Government in ensuring everyone makes a contribution toward raising additional revenue and broadening the tax base in our efforts to address the difficulties we are experiencing in the public finances.It is important, notwithstanding our straitened circumstances, that we continue to support enterprise.  I made the point in my budget speech that, despite the recent increases, our tax system remains competitive and pro-enterprise in character.  Accordingly, I renewed the Government's commitment to our 12.5% corporate tax regime.  This is essential to economic renewal.  We cannot stand still.  I undertook in the supplementary budget to introduce a scheme of tax relief for the acquisition of intangible assets as a means of supporting the smart economy.  This measure will help maintain employment in our existing industrial base and will help attract sustainable high quality jobs in the future into the economy.The budget also sought to support the hard-pressed motor industry.  However, since the supplementary budget, further discussions have taken place with the motor industry.  While the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, was appreciative of the Government's efforts to try to assist the industry, it considered, in view especially of the difficult financing situation facing the industry, that on balance it would not be in its overall best interest for the VAT margin scheme to be introduced at this time.  There will be further dialogue with SIMI, especially in regard to dealing with the large stock of second-hand cars held by dealers.The Bill before the House runs to 28 sections and is structured by tax headings.  I will outline some of the main provisions, in the time available to me.  Section 2 makes provision for the doubling of income levy rates and reducing of the rate thresholds from 1 May 2009, as announced in the supplementary budget.  A rate of 2% will apply on income up to €75,036, 4% on the balance up to €174,980 and 6% on any income above that amount.  The exemption threshold is also reduced from €18,304 to €15,028.  Those with an entitlement to the medical card remain exempt from the income levy.  For those over 65 years, the exemption remains at €20,000 for single individuals and €40,000 for married couples.  Social welfare and similar type payments also remain exempt from the levy.  The income levy is a progressive measure, with those most able to pay paying the most.  The most vulnerable are protected by exemptions.The composite rate provision, applying to 2009, included in this section is intended as an anti-avoidance measure which prevents individuals who can control their income from front-loading their yearly income to avoid the higher rates.  This section also clarifies that redundancy payments made in the first four months of the year will only be subject to the income levy rates in force during this period.Sections 3 and 4 make provision for the supplementary budget announcement that from 1 May, mortgage interest relief will be limited to the first seven years for qualifying home loans.  This measure focuses resources on those most in need and provides a saving to the Exchequer.  The relief remains available to first-time buyers and those taking out a new qualifying loan for the purposes of trading up or improving their principal private residence.Section 5 gives effect to the budget announcement whereby the level of tax relief investors can claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties is reduced to 75% of the interest accrued from 7 April 2009.  I am introducing this measure at a time when mortgage interest rates are at historical lows and the repayment burden on investors has been reduced significantly.  The interest component of repayments is now less than 50% of the levels that obtained as recently as two years ago.  I am aware that rents are falling after a number of years of strong growth.  This fact was taken into consideration when I framed the supplementary budget and decided to reduce rather than abolish this relief.  Ordinary workers on relatively modest incomes are being asked to make additional contributions to help with the recovery in the public finances, and it is fair and equitable and ensures that residential investors contribute a proportionate share of the burden of adjustment needed in this economy.Section 6 abolishes the 20% incentive rate of tax for income arising from dealing in residential development land with effect from the 2009 tax year.  Such income will be taxed under normal income tax rules.  The incentive rate is being abolished in recognition of the fact that the relief has served its stated purpose of releasing development land.  The measure also introduces new arrangements for dealing with losses which ensures that where profits were taxed at 20%, losses cannot be relieved at 41%.  Any such loss will now be converted into a tax credit valued at 20% of the loss and can be offset sideways against income tax which would otherwise be payable on the person's other income.Section 7 extends the period during which applications for certification can be made to the mid-Shannon tourism infrastructure scheme board from one year to two years so that the latest date for the submission of applications is 31 May 2010.  Second, to cater for any projects that may avail of the new date for the submission of applications for approval, the period within which expenditure must be incurred for capital allowances is being extended from 31 May 2011 and will now end on 31 May 2013.  It is my understanding that a number of significant projects are in the pipeline which have not yet been submitted formally to the board for approval.  A feature of the projects identified is that they are nearly all being promoted by experienced tourism operators who have the capacity to create sustainable businesses with a clear customer focus, rather than being solely driven by investors.  If the existing deadline for submission of projects to the board for certification is retained, none of these projects will be able to proceed.Section 8 amends sections 268 and 316 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of certain health-related facilities in order to provide for the termination of these capital allowances schemes and for transitional measures for pipeline projects.  The facilities covered by this section are registered nursing homes, convalescent homes, qualifying hospitals and mental health centres.The amendments to section 268 provide that certain schemes that were previously open-ended with regard to incurring qualifying expenditure for capital allowances purposes now have a termination date of 31 December 2009, unless certain qualifying criteria are met.  The amendment to section 316 ensures that in respect of these types of facilities, the normal rule about capital expenditure being incurred when it is payable is disregarded and, instead, expenditure is treated as incurred when it is properly attributable to construction or refurbishment work that has actually been carried out.Section 9 increases the rate of tax that applies to interest on deposit accounts and income from certain other savings products.  The normal rate of tax is increased from 23% to 25% with effect from 8 April.  For more long-term savings products, the rate of tax which applies is increased from 26% to 28%, also with effect from 8 April.  Although the rates are increased by 2%, it remains the case that this income is not subject to the income levy.Section 10 increases by two percentage points the rate of exit tax on life assurance policies and other investment funds, with effect from 8 April.  Products previously taxable at 23% are now taxed at 25%, and those previously taxed at 26% are now taxed at 28%.  As an anti-avoidance measure, where the investment is held in a personal portfolio investment undertaking or a personal portfolio life policy, the tax rate that applies with effect from 8 April is the standard rate plus an additional 28 percentage points.  Likewise, where such a payment is made in respect of a foreign life policy or an offshore fund and is not correctly included in the investor's tax return, the rate of tax that applies with effect from 8 April is at the investor's marginal rate plus an additional 25 percentage points.Section 11, in tandem with arrangements made in section 6, abolishes the effective 20% rate applied to trading profits from dealing in residential development land with effect from l January 2009.  An accounting period that straddles that date is treated for this purpose as two accounting periods.  Profits or gains on dealing in residential development land will now be charged at the general rate of corporation tax that applies to dealing in land, which is 25%.Section 11 also introduces the new section 644C to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section restricts the allowance of losses on residential land incurred before 1 January 2009 and carried forward to accounting periods beginning on or after that date to allowance on a value basis.  This is to ensure that the effect of the tax treatment of trading losses is commensurate with the effect of the increase in the tax rate on trading income from 20% to 25%.Section 12 is a technical amendment to ensure that, where an Irish resident company makes a gain on the disposal of shares deriving their value from exploration or exploitation rights, the gain will not be exempt from tax under what is known as the "participation exemption".  By closing off a potential loophole, this measure means that such shares are treated the same as shares deriving their value from land or minerals in the State.Section 13 provides for a new scheme of tax relief for capital expenditure incurred by companies on intangible assets, as announced in the supplementary budget.  A new section 291A is being included in part 9, chapter 2, of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for this purpose.  The scheme provides for capital allowances against taxable income on capital expenditure incurred by companies on the provision of intangible assets for the purposes of a trade.  The scheme applies to intangible assets which are recognised as such under generally accepted accounting practice and which are included in the specified categories listed in the new section.Allowances provided under the scheme will reflect the standard accounting treatment of intangible assets and will be based on the amount charged to the profit and loss account of the company for the accounting period in respect of the amortisation or depreciation of the specified intangible asset.  However, companies can opt instead for a fixed write-down period of 15 years at a rate of 7% per annum and 2% in the final year.  The allowances currently available for capital expenditure on the provision of computer software under section 291 of the Taxes Consolidation Act are being retained and the new scheme does not therefore apply to computer software.  As patent rights and know-how are being included in the new scheme, the existing reliefs for capital expenditure on patent rights and know-how are being discontinued for companies, but with provision for companies to opt for these reliefs for a further two-year period.  The new scheme applies to expenditure incurred by a company after 7 May 2009.Section 14 increases the rate of capital gains tax from 22% to 25%.  This change applies with effect from 8 April 2009.  Sections 15 and 16 confirm the supplementary budget increases as follows: in mineral oil tax of 5 cent per litre, inclusive of VAT on auto-diesel; and in excise duty of 25 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes, inclusive of VAT, with a pro rata increase on other tobacco products.Section 17 provides the necessary legislative change for my decision, announced on 25 February, to exempt small peripheral airports from the air travel tax.  It amends the definition of "airport" used for the air travel tax to exclude from the scope of the tax airports from which fewer than 50,000 persons departed on aircraft in the previous calendar year.With regard to section 18, the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 introduced an unjust enrichment provision in respect of VRT to limit the repayment of VRT claims by dealers, primarily to the amount that a dealer would pass on to the first registered owner of a vehicle who, in effect, would have paid the VRT.  This section amends the formula that is used for the calculation of a repayment of VRT on a pro rata basis, where the first registered owner of a vehicle which is eligible for the repayment of VRT has disposed of the vehicle prior to the date of repayment.  It is a technical amendment.Section 19 is an interpretation section for the stamp duty provisions of the Bill.  Section 20 provides for a new exchange of houses scheme, under which a person selling a new residential property can take a second-hand residence in exchange or part-exchange and will not have to pay the stamp duty on the second-hand property until he or she either sells on the second-hand property or, in any event, by 31 December 2010, when the scheme ends.  The purpose of the scheme is to give impetus to the residential property market by freeing up the overhang of completed but unsold new property, with consequential impact on employment.Section 21 is a technical follow-up from section 13 which deals with intangible assets.  The definition of intellectual property has been amended in the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to align it broadly with a similar definition being inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by section 13 of this Bill.  It should be noted that this change applies to instruments executed after 7 May 2009.Section 22 provides for an increase from 2% to 3% in the existing levy on non-life insurance products.  The non-life insurance levy does not apply to voluntary health insurance, re-insurance, marine, aviation and transport insurance, export credit insurance and certain dental contracts.  The section also provides for a new 1% levy on life insurance premiums.Section 23 provides for an increase in the rate of capital acquisitions tax from 22% to 25%, and for a reduction by approximately 20% in the thresholds below which a gift or inheritance can be taken free of tax.  Although this is the first time that the CAT tax-free thresholds have been reduced, I consider this reduction is justified in light of recent economic conditions.  The tax-free thresholds remain generous.  They now stand at €424,000 for gifts and inheritances from parents to children, €42,400 for gifts and inheritances between siblings, from aunts and uncles to nieces and nephews, from grandparents to grandchildren, and €21,700 for gifts and inheritances not subject between individuals not covered by the first two categories.  The changes to the rate of capital acquisitions tax and to the tax-free thresholds both apply from 8 April 2009.The rates of deposit interest retention tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax are all now 25%.  This is part of the Government's base broadening measures and ensuring that all forms of income contribute to the fiscal correction.  The increases in the taxation of capital and savings will ease the taxes which would otherwise have to be imposed on labour and consumption.Section 24 is an interpretation section.  Section 25 reduces the statutory rate of interest applied by Revenue to delayed payments of taxation and to underpayments by taxpayers engaged in business activities.  The current daily rates will be reduced by approximately 20%, giving respective annualised equivalents of some 8% and 10%, from 1 July 2009.Section 26 covers miscellaneous technical amendments in relation to tax.  These proposed amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999 and the Finance Act (No. 2) 2008 correct some minor drafting changes and cross references which were overlooked during the drafting of the original legislation.There is still a small number of matters under consideration that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate today and tomorrow.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20512	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I do not have to tell the Minister or the Ceann Comhairle that Ireland is facing frightening challenges on every front.  The ESRI brought people up with a sharp jolt when we realised that 300,000 jobs might be lost before the end of next year, potentially bringing unemployment figures on the live register measure to over 600,000.  That is an appalling prospect and has been brought on by a series of catastrophic policy failures in this country.  We now have the worst public finances in Europe, collapsed competitiveness — where we once were very strong and competitive — banks that are totally frozen and a property meltdown.  The first lesson we must learn is that we must understand the policy failures that were made so that we can plot a course that is based on addressing some of them.  I find it dispiriting that the recent budget has not properly faced up to the reality that this Government and former Ministers for Finance pursued irresponsible public spending policies.They were irresponsible in terms of the business cycle and the way money was expanded into the teeth of booming conditions, and in the quality of spending and the willingness to ramp it up, regardless of results.  Then there was the refusal to pursue genuine public service reform.  The notion was abroad that change did not have to be delivered for money that was given out.  Benchmarking was the highpoint of that, money dished out and nothing asked in return.  Decentralisation was out of the same stable.  It was saying to committed public servants, in effect, "We do not care about the quality of your work or the institutions you are working in.  We will move you around, to meet political needs, like pawns on a board".  That, again, destroyed the commitment to reform and professionalism in the public service.We have persisted in running a budget system which, as I have said repeatedly, is not fit for running a corner shop.  We take no account of capital costs in the way we fund agencies, allowing them to be financed on the basis of last year's budget, not on any commitment to deliver results.  Year after year in the Estimates debates I appealed for change to the Minister's predecessors with regard to the manner in which we were spending our money and putting budgets together, and was met with blank refusals.Public policy irresponsibly destroyed our competitiveness.  That is what happened in the last five years and it was driven by public policy, the cheerleading of the property bubble, the excessive public spending commitments, the willingness to buy out problems instead of confronting them, the cosy relationships that meant regulators did not turn over the stones and did not demand standards from those they regulated.  Then there was the inability to confront failure in public commitments or waste in public spending, or rip-offs coming from public sector bodies.  These all enormously coroded the basis on which our country managed its affairs, and have to be confronted.  The cost of running Government in Ireland is simply too high.  We are not effective at doing what we are charged with overseeing.  That has to be addressed and should have been at the core of this budget.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case.Equally, we emerge from a legacy where those who challenged were frozen out.  They were described as being "suicidal" or ought to be committing suicide, as the former Taoiseach said of those who questioned the soundness of our model.  That was another element of irresponsibility in the face of serious issues which were coming our way, the denial and refusal to face up to things, and now we are paying.  Ordinary families, who were crippled in the recent budget, are paying.  They are being asked to give up early childhood supplements for the under-fives, mortgage relief and to shoulder the levies.  They do not see the corresponding strategy, however, that says this pain is getting us somewhere.  Neither do they see reform in the way we spend our money or in the public services.  They do not see a strategy to protect employment at a time when it is haemorrhaging at an extraordinary and appalling rate.People are despondent because the essence of what is needed from Government is a coherent strategy that confronts all our problems.  This budget solely looked at one narrow public finance problem, and addressed it in just one way — by hiking up taxes to fill the gap.  Some 75% of the adjustments that were made on the current side to fill what the Minister called his structural deficit were achieved by demanding people to pay extra taxation — only 25% came from the Government cutting the cost of running its own affairs, and that was the wrong balance.  On top of that, of course, we cut capital spending, and thereby hangs another tale.Having looked at all that and the pain that is being imposed, it was particularly disappointing to find what the Minister had achieved as regards the 10% structural deficit he said had to be adjusted.  Only 16%, less than one sixth of the structural deficit he said had to be corrected was done in year one.  On his strategy for next year he will get a quarter of it, so even at the end of this year's tax increases along with the other €2.5 billion he has pencilled in for next year, we shall only be a quarter of the way towards dealing with the structural deficit the Minister says has been caused by our poor policies.There is insufficient confrontation with the problems we face in the manner the budget was put together.  We must look at strategies that protect employment.  What can we do better to protect it?  What can we do to cut the costs of running Government — particularly the costs that impact on jobs, but also those that affect what we are doing on a day to day basis?  We have to find new ways of investing.  Fine Gael put forward a strategy on how to invest in infrastructure we need for the future and the response from the other side of the House was just to scoff.  That was a robust approach and one we ought to be seriously looking at.  At this time we must look at where our opportunities still lie and work those relentlessly.  Instead, this Finance Bill is persisting with the very narrow agenda that was in the budget, and that is not good enough.The impact on ordinary families is enormous, as I do not need to tell the Minister, since I am sure he hears this on the doorsteps.  Someone on the average industrial wage, €36,400, is on a marginal tax rate of 51%, which is extraordinary for a country where the Government up to now prided itself in keeping the tax on work low.  It proclaimed that keeping direct taxes low was the key to Ireland's economic success, and now someone on the average industrial wage must pay a marginal rate of 51%.  For a married person who is the single earner in the family, the princely sum of €45,400 puts him or her into the 51% category.  That is not, by any means, fulfilling the strategy the Minister said he was going to address.I find it very dispiriting in the Finance Bill that even after the publication of the ESRI report, with the 300,000 jobs it saw disappearing over the next 20 months, it offers no new initiative as to how we shall protect the employment that is now so vulnerable.  Other countries are doing the opposite to what we are doing.  They are looking at how they may tweak the tax code to postpone the payment of some taxes, to relax the payment dates.  In the UK they are looking at how companies in some form of trouble might be helped by having their taxes postponed.  Other countries are trying to rejig the social insurance mechanism to make it easier for people to protect employment.  They are looking at the welfare rules to see whether employers may have a system whereby they keep their people close even when order books are very low.  They are tweaking their rules, trying to be imaginative, by helping companies and people to get through.Other jurisdictions are looking at their VAT rates, and as we suggested, cutting them temporarily.  In the UK I am aware this did enormous damage as regards the North-South trade, but we could have examined cutting the low rate of VAT, which applies to labour intensive activity.  This would have meant a big boost for domestic tourism and home improvements, the types of initiative that need to be kickstarted at this time, with employment under such threat.  That dimension has been missing from the way in which the budget was put together.  We need to consider initiatives taken by other countries and see if they have relevance for us.  That should have been done in the preparation of this Finance Bill but there is no imprint of such thinking.The danger in focusing on tax correction, to which I have alluded, is that it will destroy confidence in the country.  The ESRI report showed that ordinary consumers were hoarding.  They have decided that now is not the time to spend.  Businesses are hoarding because they are not willing to invest.  Banks are hoarding to protect their skins.  Everyone is hoarding money.  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy and we must find a way of cutting into it.The core of the Fine Gael proposal is to look at the investments which can and should be made.  We should invest in an electricity grid and a telecommunications network.  Whatever happens in the next few years we will need these services to be better than they are.  This is the time to provide them.  Fine Gael showed how this could be done without increasing Exchequer borrowing by one cent.  Our proposals have greater attraction than the Construction Industry Federation model which similarly seeks to use pension fund money but does not look at investment in areas which will improve our competitiveness as we struggle out of this economic difficulty.  The Fine Gael proposals look at the infrastructure we will need in two years time when, I hope, the green shoots of economic recovery will begin to appear.  We can then start to seize opportunities.  We must correct the infrastructures which have gone so badly wrong.  This has become the most expensive country for electricity and waste management services.  In huge areas where the public sector has had responsibility we have become uncompetitive.  We are at the wrong end of all league tables of vital infrastructures.  We need fresh thinking.The State must box smarter.  The Minister spoke about the smart economy in the document he published before Christmas.  In this time of crisis what we need is a smart State.  I accept that we are constrained by the state of the public finances and can do far fewer things than we would like.  Nevertheless, there are still things we can do, but they are absent from Government thinking.  I am dismally disappointed by the lack of restructuring of Government activity.  The Minister recognised the need for this when he established the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, under Mr. Colm McCarthy, to engage in a zero budget exercise and recommend genuine restructuring of the way we spend public money.  There is not a single fingerprint of such thinking on the emergency budget.  It is not good enough to postpone serious restructuring because of the current crisis.  We need to see it now.  Not only do we need to make the savings it will generate but we must also show that the State is thinking afresh.  There is no trace of such fresh thinking in the Finance Bill.We have a destructive budgeting model that is destroying initiative.  I am appalled by what hospitals do when their budgets come under strain.  They close down theatres and wards and turn patients away.  What budgeting system encourages huge institutions, in which we have invested billions of euro, to behave in this way?  Such institutions should try to treat more patients, sweat their assets and deliver a more effective service in order to get through periods of constraint.  They should earn their way out of crises by getting more patients in, treating them more effectively and having a greater turnover.  Our budget system does not allow this to happen.  That is why Fine Gael is hugely attracted to a complete change in the health funding model.  We must switch to a system in which the money would follow the patient and a patient who comes in the door of a hospital would be seen as a revenue source.  Similarly, in such a system patients would not stay in a hospital "blocking beds".  The Fine Gael system would allow them to move to convalescence and free up beds.  A hospital, a hugely expensive asset, should not be used as a nursing home.  There are 164 blocked beds in the three hospitals on the north side of Dublin, the equivalent of one small hospital taken out of commission, because of our dysfunctional budgeting system.  There is no incentive for anyone to move patients and use assets more effectively.We must rethink the way we budget.  This change is a core issue which Fine Gael has been articulating.  If the Government will not confront these necessary changes now in a time of crisis, they will never be confronted.  In the past the Government bought out problems instead of confronting them.  That has done untold damage to the public service culture.  We have public servants with real commitment but they feel trapped in a system which is not working.  They are trapped in hospitals and schools.  We must empower school principals.  It is unacceptable that a teacher who is not up to scratch could blight the future of children.  This is not a reflection on the principal.  We must empower people who are managing public money to address these problems and live up to the professional standards to which they are committed.  We can do this if we start to change the budgeting system.We must expect performance to be reported upon and take performance failure seriously.  This does not happen.  Last year Departments failed to meet 40% of their targets, but nothing happened.  The Minister for Finance did not take this failure seriously, neither did the Departments.  One cannot have a system which routinely tolerates failure to deliver.  Failure is tolerated from year to year on Estimates and, even more, big strategies such as that on climate change.  Our climate change strategy was supposed to change the world but after eight years it has made no impact on our carbon footprint.  No one takes responsibility for that failure.  We cannot accept this any longer, either from Ministers or from the managers they appoint to do their work for them.  When these changes occur, we will see a different approach to the use of public money.  This was the time to make these changes.The Government has focused on tax increases rather than job protection and creation or on cutting the cost of government.  We can see the threads of this failure in the Budget Statement.  At present, 12.5% of income tax is needed to pay the interest on Government debt.  Under the Minister's projections, by 2013 interest repayments will need 60% of income tax.  If we add to this the debt which will be engendered by buying the assets from the banks, 75% of our income tax receipts will go in interest payments.  This will close off huge blocks of tax revenue from potential spending and investment.  We are going down a dangerous road.  We went down this road before and cannot afford to slip down it again.  In this budget I see the threads of an approach which will take us down it.  This approach does not confront our problems.One does not get many chances to cry "Wolf" and make changes.  How many times has the Minister brought a so-called emergency budget to the House and hyped everyone up with promises of great changes which did not happen?  We have not seen great changes in the way we spend public money or in the demands we place on electricity companies or those who manage waste facilities.  When one such opportunity is missed, it is very difficult to recreate the intensity required for major change.  That opportunity was missed in the budget.I return to the main element of the budget, that is, the NAMA measure.  I am concerned that it is a time bomb.  It is important to put some questions on the matter and the easiest are the simple ones.  Will it get credit going?  Is this the least expensive way of doing so?  If it does not work, will it be possible to pull out without incurring too much cost?  Is it possible that we will become too committed by taking this route?Recently, I read a book entitled 20/20 Foresight.  The author discussed the different forms of uncertainty one may face.  Sometimes it is a case of facing a prong on the road and choosing the first or the second.  Sometimes the uncertainty is so vast that one does not know where in the spectrum the ball may fall.  The thesis of the book is that one may still analyse choices and what may happen, even in a very uncertain world.  By and large, one does not take a large bet in such an uncertain space.  One does not say because one does not know enough about it, “This is the time for all or nothing.  Let us gamble the house on this option.”   I am concerned that the Minister is gambling the house on this NAMA notion and I do not know from where it has come.I realise Professor Bacon has his view, but he is a single economist and it seems there are a heap of others arraigned who do not agree with it.  I presume the Minister also has advisers.  However, many of these advisers were supposed to be riding shotgun on the banks.  All we have seen in the public domain is a short summary of a larger document in which we are supposed to have faith.  People simply do not have faith.  I do not have it and I try to keep myself as well informed as possible on what is taking place.  I do not believe the wider public has faith either.It is very much a case of festina lente.  This is a small country and we should not pioneer Big Bang solutions to problems of this nature.  We should examine the changes we can make now, examine their impact and consider the next step.  That is why I am very attracted to the idea of a wholesale bank which would provide credit for good activities, which would be willing to buy the good elements of the loan book, which could stimulate refinancing and provide liquidity for the good elements of banking activity.  We need a State wholesale bank which could still be called a national management asset agency because it would buy good assets instead of bad ones and begin to generate liquidity for the banks.  It could provide a source of funds and if banks were offering mortgages or business credit, they could sell these on, in turn, and securitise them to the wholesale bank.My first question was if such an enterprise could get credit going and the answer is yes straight into the vein.  It could begin to provide liquidity.  This would allow time to consider what to do with the bad assets.  One should not become a world pioneer in providing a Big Bang solution and establish a State company owning assets worth €90 billion, or approximately 70% of GNP.  Vast tracts of land, empty houses and God knows what else would be owned by such an agency, according to the proposals made.  It is a very large throw of the dice.  The Taoiseach recently quoted Professor Honohan who stated the proposal was Napoleonic in scope.  However, the Taoiseach was somewhat economical in quoting Professor Honohan.

It involves buying the assets and recapitalising the banks; a great deal of cash is demanded up-front.  The alternative would not require as much.  Significant incentives may still be needed if the banks continue to shrink their balance sheets.  They are shrinking their balance sheets to maintain independence from the State, which is natural.  They will try to save the skins of their investors and are doing so.  As the State invests money they will seek to shrink their loan books to preserve their independence and there is an incentive for them to do so.

There has not been an arena to examine the matter seriously.  We appear to be rushing headlong down the road without seeing anything.The proposal also plunges the State into letting professional investors off the hook.  If we go down the NAMA route, shareholders will burn because of the haircut but professional investors will not.  We are moving to a situation where we are effectively underpinning professional investors.  I realise that many take the view that Ireland cannot afford to burn professional investors.  However, if we allow some time, we will see many countries take the view that they cannot save everyone because the taxpayer's shoulder is not broad enough to bail out professional investors.  Such people invested money knowingly in banks which engaged in securitisation in other countries and property lending in this country at a time of much economic activity.  They were big boys and knew what they were doing.  Why should ordinary families and taxpayers shoulder the burden?  I understand the Government might state it does not wish to pioneer the burning of these investors.  However, we should allow time, take the approach of refinancing what it is we wish to get going but take our time in respect of what will take place in the rest of the banking sector and who will take the hit.  We should allow ourselves time to see what other countries will do.I refer back to the idea of 20/20 Foresight in this impossibly uncertain world.  If we take small steps, we can begin to see the landscape ahead of us more clearly.  I am genuinely concerned that the Minister may expose the taxpayer to very substantial losses and that we do not know enough about the matter.  Theoretically, it is an attractive proposal and I understand how a professor of economics would be delighted to have it as a tool on his or her desk which he or she could wind up, let off and produce results.  However, we are living in the real world in which the decisions we make may hurt families and businesses and we must be very careful.  It is not a question of being partisan; I am genuinely concerned that this is not the correct roll of the dice for us.  We should be more prudent.  Some elements may work but I would rather begin with an agency buying good loans.  Let us see if we can get liquidity moving in the banks and let us give them an outlet for new lending such that they will not be so cautious about shrinking their balance sheets for fear of what may appear on the balance sheet of a wholesale State bank.There will be plenty of time, probably too much time, on Committee Stage to discuss the other sections of the Bill.  However, I have made some general comments concerning the challenges we face.  I hope our debate on the Bill will be successful.  I will put questions concerning the extension of the property-based scheme for private hospitals to 2013.  It seems once such a hospital has applied for planning permission, there will be a window up to 2013 in which to build it, which is a flawed policy.  The building of a private hospital on the grounds of Beaumont Hospital is not what that hospital needs.  This is a legacy of a failed policy which should be jettisoned at a time when we are examining new sets of priorities.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I refer to the Taoiseach's peevishness during Taoiseach's Questions and later during Leaders' Questions in which he seemed very out of sorts.  Presumably, this was the result of meeting voters in various constituencies.  This will go down in Irish history as the crony capitalism period that destroyed much of the prosperity achieved during the Celtic tiger years.  Whether the Taoiseach likes it, the phrase "crony capitalism" which was coined by the Financial Times, was used specifically by Dr. Bacon in his proposals.  One argument he has made is that NAMA might help Fianna Fáil, I presume, to come to grips with its builder and banker friends.  The unholy trinity of bankers, builders and Fianna Fáil has brought the economy to this point.I am disappointed the Minister for Finance is possibly leaving.  It is difficult for me and Deputy Bruton to have any meaningful time in the Dáil with the Minister, but it is important that we do so, particularly on an issue as fundamental as this to the future of the country, our children and grandchildren.  We are discussing the proposal for NAMA to take assets with a reduced book value of €50 billion.  That is bigger than any hedge fund that would operate out of Ireland.  As has been pointed out, NAMA's assets will amount to an extraordinary figure in the context of Irish history.

Put simply, in the run-up to the budget, the Minister for Finance announced a recapitalisation programme that he said would work.  For a period of four months, he was confident that recapitalisation would work.  The sums involved were €3.5 billion for the Bank of Ireland and €3.5 billion for Allied Irish Banks.  Today, on the eve of its meeting tomorrow, AIB announced its bad debt writedown was actually €4.3 billion.  I will tell the Minister what that means to ordinary people.  It means the €3.5 billion of public money that he took for the recapitalisation of the two banks has been used and is gone.  Not only that, AIB requires another €800 million to meet its bad debts this year and acknowledges that this does not take account of the debts that will accrue next year and the year after.  We are in a truly terrible position.The reason for the Government's lack of flexibility is the incredible guarantee of about €440 billion the Minister gave the six covered institutions last September, which hangs like the sword of Damocles over the head of every single taxpayer now and in the future.  The Minister has been unable to say whether NAMA provides a mechanism for exiting the guarantee.  It has been suggested by people such as Willem Buiter in the Financial Times that it would be possible to exit the guarantee through something like the proposal Deputy Bruton mentioned, but how can we exit it cost free, given that we have given the guarantee?  That is the problem.  As the banks would tell us, if the guarantee was withdrawn and not renewed, short of nationalisation, the options would be limited.  All four parties represented in the Chamber, including Sinn Féin, recognise this dilemma which is at the core of the difficulties.  We can do what Willem Buiter says if we welch on the guarantee, but that might put us in the position of Argentina.We have to talk this out seriously.  The Minister and the Taoiseach must acknowledge that Members on the Opposition benches are putting a huge amount of time and effort into trying to think this out and get decent advice.  When the Taoiseach quoted Professor Honohan, he chose to do so selectively.  I will read what Professor Honohan actually said:We have brief statements and indications from Government sources and a very brief report from Peter Bacon which, as the Deputy [me] said, does not deal with how NAMA will work. Maybe I am being naive in hoping that at some stage all of this issue will become clear and will be brought out into the open.  Transparency is key but it has not happened so far.  I share the Deputy's concerns that this will not be done very well.For what it is worth — my opinion is probably not worth very much — I am not against nationalisation at all costs.  We come to the point in our discussion and in our calculations that we are in the territory of 90% State ownership and I do not disagree with that. The question now is whether there is a reason to hesitate to go to 100% ownership or a reason to look for a way of avoiding the 100%.In his balanced contribution, Professor Honohan recognised that the differences between the positions were paper thin.On the Finance Bill 2009, let me be clear that the ordinary family with two parents and two or three children and an income of €40,000 to €90,000 is bearing the brunt of the Government's mismanagement of the banking crisis.  In an answer to a parliamentary question I received this afternoon, the Minister acknowledges formally that a single individual earning about €80,000 will have a marginal tax rate of 50% for 2009.  This is a combination of income tax at 41%, an income levy of 4% and a health levy of 5%.  An individual earning €175,000 or more will have a marginal tax rate of 52% for 2009.  This is a combination of income tax at 41%, an income levy of 6% and a health levy of 5%.  When tax credits and so on are taken into account, an individual on €80,000 will have an effective average tax rate of 36%.  These tax rates have not been seen since the early 1990s.The Minister should bear in mind that since the early 1990s we have also had an attempt through a Progressive Democrats led taxation strategy to reduce nominal rates of income tax, to increase VAT rates, including the Minister's disastrous increase in the VAT rate to 21.5% in the October budget, and to massively increase direct charges and levies for services originally paid for out of income tax receipts, particularly the direct payments people have to make at the point of use for medical services.  We now have a marginal rate of 50% and an average effective tax rate of 36%.  These are very high rates.  It is extremely problematic in that the Minister also promised to continue an assault on families with children in his next budget.I want, in particular, to refer to the Minister's several proposals in regard to families with children which are in the pipeline for his next budget.  It is unfortunate he has not been prepared to talk about the impact of his budgetary proposals on families with children.  First, as I understand it, he is proposing to possibly introduce an individual house tax of approximately €1,000 on all houses.  Second, he is proposing, as I understand it from his budget speech, to either tax or means test child benefit with a view to, in effect, significantly reducing its benefit to people who work in the PAYE  sector and who earn between €40,000 and €90,000, whether it is a single income family or double income family.  Third, as I understand it, the Minister is proposing to significantly increase the charge for families with children who intend to go to university.  He is increasing the registration fee to €1,500 in September, and I understand from the Minister for Education and Science that he is considering various proposals with regard to the reintroduction of fees.Families at work with two or three children, whether paying an expensive mortgage, on a fixed rate mortgage or with a loan that has gone over the seven year limit, will lose their mortgage interest relief under this budget.  As a consequence, such families will suffer a very high impact on their capacity to look after the needs of their children but this has not received enough attention from the Government.I want to say the following as a woman Deputy.  There are very few women in this House who take part in budget debates.  Why, whenever there are difficulties in regard to budgetary matters, is the principle of child benefit attacked by the legions of male politicians who form the overwhelming majority in this House?  Why is it the first item up for attack?  The Minister was true to form in the recent budget in that the first measure that will be up for attack is child benefit.Let us put aside all the fairy stories, war stories and tales of "dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean lei" from those who know that when child benefit day comes around, the mothers of Ireland somehow go out and spend it on themselves — they get their hair done, have lunch with a friend or something like that.  The reality with regard to child benefit is, I suspect, that of the families who receive it, the rate of abuse is less than 0.1%.  For most women who manage child benefit, it is the income over which they actually have control.  In some cases, they may be married to somebody who is well-off but that person may not give them much income.  They manage child benefit extraordinarily well.  It pays for children's clothes, shoes, books, dentistry and, in some cases, families are now starting to save a portion of the child benefit for fees when the children go on to college and third level.The Minister was wrong when he spoke in his budget speech as though child benefit and families with children were a soft target.  If he analysed this, he would find that, going all the way back to when child benefit was introduced, whenever there has been an economic difficulty, the soft touch has been to suggest that all of the Mrs. Millionaires who are in receipt of child benefit would be better off without it.  The answer in regard to Mrs. and Mr. Millionaire is that in a fair taxation system they would contribute their fair share of tax so that they could get the one universal benefit this State offers.We should remember that before child benefit was introduced in the 1940s and 1950s, men, who then comprised the bulk of the workforce, got direct tax allowances in regard to children.  The move to child benefit was to direct a payment to families with children and to the caring parent, which was normally, until relatively recently, the mother, most of whom in those days were women who spent their lives in the home taking care of dependent children, and dependent adults in many cases.It is wrong that the Minister's budget should have floated the boat that child benefit is a soft touch.  This issue is extraordinarily important to women in Ireland.  I hope we can get more women into this Chamber who can talk about what this area of Government funding means to them and their children, and to the many fathers who have opted to stay at home for some years to parent their children.I want to ask the Minister about a number of items in the Bill.  I want to return to the issue of the Minister's changes in regard to profits on land dealing.  On budget day, I raised a related issue, namely, the fact that in the current climate, losses in regard to any trade or profession can be carried forward indefinitely but they can also, in effect, be written back against the tax that has been paid in the current year.  This means there is a huge refund bill awaiting the taxpayer in regard to developers and builders which is probably running to a couple of billion euro.  Even more importantly, the taxpayer is facing refund demands from the banks, particularly the covered institutions, which also run to huge sums.On budget day, if I recall correctly, the Minister promised me he would address this issue in the Bill.  It seems inconceivable that the taxpayer is spending vast sums of money guaranteeing the banks and putting in recapitalisation funds, and that the whole of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is earmarked for NAMA.  When he came before the committee last week, Professor Honohan, while he did not disagree with the IMF and its figure of €24 billion, wondered whether €50 billion was a more appropriate figure for the cost of NAMA.  When the Taoiseach is quoting Professor Honohan, he ought to take the trouble to quote him fairly.I would like to know whether the Minister proposes to introduce a restriction in the Finance Bill that will restrict the writing off of losses, creating vast refunds in respect of developments where we have already given huge tax breaks which meant that many of these developers got a very good deal.  It seems we are about to give future refunds and we will pay on the double when the banks write down their loans and carry those loans as losses against whatever they may have paid in the 2007 and 2008 period, because that is the way loss legislation is framed.  As the Minister will know, if some of the companies go into liquidation, an even more favourable issue in regard to the recovery of losses can arise.  I do not believe the taxpayer should be hit for another hidden couple of billion euro charge as a consequence of the Minister not addressing this loophole.I have a question to raise about tax exiles.  Why did an ordinary family with two children take a significant hit in the budget and persons making capital gains, earning income from other sources or inheriting property were all listed to make a bigger contribution?  Given the dire situation facing the economy, people understand if cuts are applied fairly and everyone contributes; this may make the sacrifices they are being asked to make less painful.  However, how is it that in both the Budget Statement and the Bill there is no mention of the estimated 6,000 tax exiles — the number estimated by the Revenue Commissioners — and their significant capacity to avoid making a contribution proportionate to the income they earn in this country?In the same context, I will ask the same question everybody else will ask on the doorsteps about developers and many of the people involved in the business of finance.  Where did all the money go and where is all the property?  How much of it is overseas?  On budget day, the Minister gave an estimate of €80 billion to €90 billion in respect of toxic distressed loans.  Did he carry out an examination to ascertain how much of this was collateralised by other assets held overseas?  Is he going to conduct an inquiry and follow the overseas collateral that should, rightly, be used to meet the obligations of developers and financiers on their loans here?I listened with amazement to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on a "Questions and Answers" programme a few weeks ago.  He suggested NAMA would take over the homes of property and construction developers.  This was the Minister hanging tough.  As this is a country that has had the Family Home Protection Act in place for a long time, the Minister who is a solicitor must have been just playing to the gallery.  Nobody wants to take anybody's home from them.  Is Fianna Fáil, having hung out with developers in the past ten years and given them everything they wanted, now sending the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appear on "Questions and Answers" to imply we are tougher than anybody else and that we will take people's homes?  Let us have a real debate about what the Government intends to do.Let us return to what has happened in various economies.  One of the key issues for the Swedes, the Finns and others around the globe when rescuing their banks was transparency.  There is no transparency here.  All we get are short statements from the Minister — as there is no debate in the House — and leaks to the newspapers.  At first, NAMA was to be a vast agency, but now it is to be a little agency and the loans will stay with the banks to be managed by the bankers who gave the loans and will now manage the recovery of debts.  I do not have the foggiest idea of what is to happen because the Minister's briefing of the media suggests one day it is this and another day, the other.

The Department of Finance, the regulator, the Central Bank and the NTMA all have a different scéal to tell about what is happening.I received a reply to a parliamentary question last week that informed me that PricewaterhouseCoopers was paid €3.8 million for the initial work it did in examining the banks' portfolios, but it did not come up with the figure of €80 billion to €90 billion.  I understand that figure probably came from the Bacon report.  I noted also from the response to my question that Merrill Lynch had been paid a retainer of €2 million and, perhaps, up to €6 million for its advice.  What advice did the Minister receive from Merrill Lynch?  It was that company which advised us to ape the British response, either by introducing an insurance scheme, a proposal it would have been madness to adopt, or some kind of guarantee.  Who in the Department decided the initial ballpoint figure to be paid to Merrill Lynch would be €2 million?  I understand also that several millions of euro was paid or committed to various legal firms for advice and that various external people were also hired by the Minister.  The Minister paid an initial €3.8 million to PricewaterhouseCoopers for its work and it has carried out further stress-testing.  Will he publish the report in order that we can see whether the so-called stress-testing amounts to a hill of beans?  Stress-testing is risk analysis, a mathematical formula.  I have asked several mathematicians to examine the formula and they have said it is mathematical mumbo jumbo.  Last week, when I put this point to Professor Honohan, he agreed that it was mathematical mumbo jumbo to try to find a figure.  Why does the Minister not level with the people on what he is getting them into?  We know the Minister is in a difficult position in trying to find the best solution, but there should be transparency.  As the Swedes said, transparency is the key.  If we had transparency, we would be in a position to see whether what the Government proposes is reasonable.  The reason people are so angry is they see themselves with a bill for €80 billion to €90 billion or for 50% or 60% of this.  We do not know how much.  It has been suggested the bill will be approximately €50 billion.  The people know this is a weight that must be borne by them, their children and, possibly, their grandchildren when they become taxpayers.Another issue is that jobs are hardly mentioned in the budget.  With the freezing of credit by the banks and the banks being pretty much like the Japanese zombie banks — just not lending — we have no Government strategy on jobs.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness, spoke on the record when he left the Department.  He said that, as a business person, he was shocked by the Department.  I served with him on the Committee of Public Accounts and I am aware he does not particularly admire the public service.  However, on some of what he had to say it sounded like a voice of experience.The challenge for the public service is to be productive.  Public servants should be well paid, but they must produce the goods.  This means they must produce enlightened policies that will help the country to retain jobs and acquire more.  The Labour Party has brought forward proposals in respect of a graduate internship system, under which graduates and apprentices would be taken on and given work experience instead of being put on the dole, at an estimated cost of €200 per week.  We have heard only very modest proposals from the Government.  It does not seem to realise that 380,000 people on the dole is a tremendous shock to the fabric of society.  Parents worry about the future of their children who are highly qualified but cannot find a job, and their children's children.  The Government has no response to the crises in three areas, banking, public finances and most of all, unemployment which affects every family, town, village and street.  The jobs crisis is the most tragic of all the problems that have afflicted this late stage of the Celtic tiger, the crony capitalist economy the Minister's party created.

To judge by the commentary inside and outside the House, the Punch and Judy school of politics is alive and well.I take umbrage at some of Deputy Burton's comments on child benefit to the effect that some people are incapable of representing families or people with young children because they are male.  I find that offensive.  I am the father of three young children and have a view that should be taken into account in any discussions about children or child benefit.  I received child benefit and the early childhood supplement until recently.  It has been always said that Ministers and Ministers of State are well remunerated for their work, and the Government has decided to reduce our salaries by 10%.  If the public and the Opposition feel I am well paid and can take a 10% pay cut, one could ask why I receive child benefit when my wife and I have decent salaries.  If we are to have a fair and serious debate on equity in our society, we should at least be honest and accept that some people can afford to live, to rear and provide for their children without receiving State supports such as child benefit.  Deputy Burton cannot deny that.This leads to the supplementary budget, the Minister for Finance's announcements and their implementation in this Bill.  We know that we face a challenging economic outlook.  The commentary from some quarters in this House suggests that it is all of our own making.  This is a simplistic view proffered primarily by the Labour Party as if the crisis in the sub-prime market in the United States, the downturn in the global economy and the depreciation of sterling-euro exchange rate had nothing to do with our difficulties.  Everybody accepts that there was an over-reliance on the property market. The Government and the Minister for Finance have said this.In 2007 the Labour Party and others put forward their projections in their election manifestos but I do not see in any part of the Labour Party's manifesto that it forewarned the Irish people or the Government of the day of the over-reliance on the property market.  I am sure Deputy Burton had a major part in its drafting.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I do not think the Minister of State read the manifesto because he would have seen it there.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	253	There was no allusion to that fact and the Labour Party's growth projections were in accordance with the norms that other political parties put forward and with international commentators and economists who said that Ireland would grow by approximately 4% in 2008 and 2009.  For people to wear rose-tinted glasses and lecture us on the basis that they forewarned us is to say the least disingenuous, and if I were to stretch it I would say it is dishonest.  People here and outside the House acknowledge that the problems confronting us are very serious.  The Minister for Finance has had to make difficult decisions.  They started with the bank guarantee on 29 September 2008 when the Government faced the potential collapse of the banking system.  That is how grave the problem was.  We can argue about how we arrived at that point but most of those problems derived from the international banking crisis that has afflicted all the modern banking systems of Europe and elsewhere.If we are to deal with the problems, we should acknowledge their root.  The reason for our economic contraction of between 8% and 9% in 2009 is in part an over-reliance on the property market but equally because this is an open global trading economy and our exports are having difficulty in markets that are struggling and contracting too.  Germany was potentially going to ride out this economic storm with projections of a 2% shrinkage in January but that has changed to 6% for this year.  People who claim the problems are all the fault of the policies pursued on this side of the House are not facing reality and do not want to do so because they do not have policies that can be costed.  They know that if we are to deal with the deficit and budgetary difficulties, people will suffer pain.  Some commentators outside the House have acknowledged that it is easy for people to highlight the difficulties but few solutions have been offered.In September 2008 Fine Gael was conscious that the banking problems were of national importance and supported the Government's view that it had to guarantee the banks to prevent a massive run on deposits that would have caused a collapse across the board.  Nobody, not even the Labour Party, can tell me that we could survive if we allowed the banking system to collapse.  Time and again Deputies talk about businesses being unable to access credit and losing their short-term overdrafts and loans, and about first-time buyers who are unable to access mortgages although they might be in secure jobs and could afford them.  If we had allowed the banking system to collapse, businesses would not have any credit facilities and we would be a basket case.  Deputy Burton has not faced the reality of this issue but there has been a lot of bluff on it.We nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, capitalised Bank of Ireland and further discussions continue.  NAMA is critical to dealing with impaired assets but there are people who consistently refer to it as "An Bord Bailout".  Everybody is aware that the capitalisation will yield dividends to the taxpayer.  There is a charge not only in the guarantee but also in the capitalisation.  People should read the fine print when they comment.  The Minister has referred to the difficulty and complexity of NAMA, and we have no choice but to deal with impaired assets because until we do the banks will not be able to access wholesale money markets and provide credit, which is of critical importance to small and medium-sized businesses and to first-time mortgage holders.I am sure every Deputy has met in his or her clinic young people who have approached banks for a mortgage but are unable to access one, despite having secure employment.  We must address that problem.  I have said a couple of times — whether people have listened is another matter — that the banks have a fundamentally different relationship with people through the bank guarantee and capitalisation scheme.  In cases where there are positive proposals to support small and medium-sized businesses or first-time mortgage holders, I urge the banks to look on them more favourably than is the case at present because the banks are stifling growth and commercial activity which is having a negative effect on Ireland's commerciality and viability.  This erodes confidence, resulting in job losses.  We would like to be honest in that debate.With regard to the issue of taxation, there is a view that if one taxes Bono, Enya and a few more, all our problems will be resolved.  The fact of the matter is that there are just not enough Enyas and Bonos in the country to deal with the current budget deficit.  The proposals introduced by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are progressive in that if one earns more, one pays more.  One can work out the income levy any way one likes but one will discover that those who earn most pay most in that context.I urge people to be responsible in the challenging times that face us.  There is potential for optimism and hope.  If one looks at trends in the international markets in recent days, one will note the announcements, emanating from Europe, that some countries may have bottomed out and are, as the jargon goes, at the inflection of this curve.  It is important that everybody in the House acknowledge the difficulties that confront us.  If one is to object to them, one should make proposals that are sensible such that we can have an honest debate on how to address the issues.  To date, I am disappointed that this attitude is not being adopted in certain quarters.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I support the Finance Bill and the difficult measures being implemented by the Government to get us out of this financial crisis.  There is no doubt but that much pain is involved in the budget and the Finance Bill.  The raising of taxes and levies is difficult for everybody but I am satisfied the attempts that have been made are fair.  They ensure that those who are earning most are paying most and that those on the bottom of the ladder are paying least.  That is not to say that everybody is not making a large contribution from his or her income.  It is the only way forward in this crisis.  The decision being made now is the same as the one that had to be made in 1987 after several years of procrastination during which we failed to take the hard decisions.The cuts that have been made to public expenditure, in addition to the increases in taxation, are vital.  The reality is that the Government has made cuts in the order of €5 billion in the three attempts that have been made, that is, in July and October of last year and in January of this year.  Opposition parties continually call for action to be taken but every time there is a cut to expenditure or an increase in taxation, they cry halt.I ask both the Labour Party and Fine Gael, and particularly the new candidate in Dublin West, whether they support Deputy Reilly's continual requests for greater expenditure in the health area.  Week in, week out, Deputy Reilly and his Fine Gael colleagues call for increased health expenditure.  Fine Gael calls for the continuation of cancer services in small hospitals across the country and, at the same time, Deputy Bruton tells us the only way forward is to cut public expenditure and not increase taxation.  There is continual hypocrisy on the part of Fine Gael.  Its members are speaking out of both sides of their mouths and calling for a general election at the same time.  It is about time that Fine Gael gave us consistent policies that will deal with the economic crisis in this country.I welcome the fact that the Labour Party has tabled a motion tonight on the nationalisation of the banks.  The reality is that the Labour Party has opposed the Government in all its fiscal and financial policies on the banking sector.  We would now be in disastrous circumstances had we gone along with the Labour Party's proposal not to introduce the bank guarantee scheme.  We would have had a disaster had we accepted the Labour Party's proposal not to put equity into the banks.  The party criticised the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and it is now calling for the nationalisation of the banking system.  This latter proposal is the one that will bring down the Labour Party.  An unbelievably crazy economic line has been taken by the party on banking policy in recent months.  It is now calling on the Government, in a motion this evening, to nationalise the banks.The only way forward is the creation of a model such as that represented by the national assets management agency.  Today's Financial Times states that, today or tomorrow, Germany will be announcing the setting up of a number of NAMA-type agencies to deal with the toxic debts in that country.  No country in the world bar Iceland has nationalised its banks.  Now it is Labour Party policy to nationalise the Irish banks.  What circumstances would Dr. Michael Somers and the National Treasury Management Agency be in if we were to nationalise our banks tonight?  What circumstances would they be in when borrowing on international markets to deal with our borrowing requirement?  If nationalised, what position would the banks be in when trying to borrow in international markets?  It is the most crazy, stupid proposal I have heard from any party in many years in this House.Deputy Gilmore stated during the Order of Business this morning that we should nationalise the banks and then clean them up.  I challenge him to spell out exactly what he means by cleaning them up.  How exactly does he propose to deal with the now very significant debts, which are now bad debts and must be taken out of the banking system?  The reality is that Irish banks will not be able to re-introduce a positive lending policy until the toxic debts they hold are taken off them.  The NAMA model, if established properly, represents the way forward.NAMA will take over the bad debts.  It will not bail out the banks and certainly will not bail out the developers.  The developers will be the first casualties, and rightly so in respect of any developers who overstretched their ability to run a good business.  It is the developers who have toxic debts who will have to be liquidated.  There are many developers in this county who have the ability to trade their way out of their difficulties given the time and the opportunity to do so.  I am confident that the NAMA model will work.  It is vital that the valuations of the assets be accurate and that those involved with the agency know the property, banking and accountancy businesses.  It is the property business that they need to know most.When NAMA was introduced in the House, Deputy Gilmore was very critical and sarcastic regarding the fact that a large percentage of the debt that NAMA will be taking over from the banks is foreign based.  However, I am confident that will prove to be very good for the Irish banking sector.  If up to 30% of Irish banking debt is overseas, we can be confident that, by and large, it will be dealt with very successfully.An Irish banker in New York contacted me recently and gave me a formula that I hope to pass on to the Minister for Finance.  He stated he could manage the Anglo Irish Bank portfolio in New York very successfully and would return a profit for the bank through the proper management of that portfolio.  Furthermore, the man stated he is confident that a reformed Irish banking sector will be in a position to avail of the opportunities that will be available internationally to return to profitability as a result of the downturn that has occurred in the banking sector internationally.While we have serious problems at present, I am confident that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, have chosen the proper way to deal with the banking sector.  It is vital that the NAMA legislation be introduced as quickly as possible, that the NAMA model be outlined to the country as quickly as possible and that the agency be set up so we can take the toxic debts off the banks.  This is the only way they can return to borrowing internationally and lending to good businesses.  This is the biggest problem and challenge facing the country.  No business has the cashflow or credit facilities to do its business successfully.  It is of the greatest urgency that the Government makes the decisions on NAMA and passes the necessary legislation.I will listen with great interest this evening to Deputy Gilmore outlining what he would do with the nationalised banks he wants to create and how he would deal with the toxic debts.  His proposal in this regard is the most crazy economic proposal we have heard in this House in a long time.

The Minister of State said Fine Gael did not know there was a global crisis.  We all know there is a global crisis, but recognised independent bodies such as the ESRI have stated that at least half our problems are due to domestic factors and Government policy.  The current situation, in which we are considering the setting up of NAMA, is due to our over-reliance on the property sector.  When the governor of the Central Bank, John Hurley, came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, he said he had repeatedly warned the Government that the construction and property sector was overheating.  In 2005 the IMF stated emphatically that Ireland was over-reliant on the construction sector.  The Government cannot say it was not told there were problems.  It was warned, and clearly it ignored these warnings.Over the years there was phenomenal growth in the property sector.  Deputy Kelleher made reference earlier to the export and business sectors.  He will know that in 2003 our exports decreased for the first time, while at the same time the property and construction sectors were increasing at a considerable rate.  The reason we are in this mess today over and above other countries — although no one denies there is a global crisis — and are facing a decline of 7% or 8% in the economy is our over-reliance on the property sector.  It is the main reason the banks are in such a mess and our public finances are in a bad state.  We moved away from the fundamentals of how the economy should be run.  We are a small, open economy which must be export-driven.  The Government took its eye off the ball.  The funds were flowing in from the construction sector.

#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Does the Minister of State agree that the Government took its eye off the ball in terms of exports?  Construction was booming and billions were coming in.  It was easy money, but the problem was that the economy became uncompetitive.  Our exports declined and the small business sector was suffering.  That is what we need to understand.With regard to the Finance Bill, I will start with the positives.  The tax relief on intellectual property is a welcome measure.  I refer to section 13 of the Bill.  However, that is the sole element of the Bill that deals with business and getting the economy going again.  I see no provision to reward employers for creating and sustaining jobs.  I see nothing about dropping the VAT rate.  The Minister for Finance admitted he had made a mistake in increasing the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 21.5%, but he did not reverse it.  When one makes a mistake the best thing to do is to hold up one's hands, admit it and reverse the decision.  Unlike Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, we suggested a stimulus of €340 million for creating and sustaining jobs.  We also suggested lowering the reduced rate of VAT from 13.5% to 10% and reversing the crazy decision to raise the upper rate.  In addition, there is the administrative aspect of a VAT increase.The one person within the Government who had a fundamental understanding of business was Deputy McGuinness, but he was given the bullet.  I set up in business as an entrepreneur 12 years ago and I understand what it is to be self-employed.  I started with nothing.  The Government cannot come along and increase the VAT rate during a VAT period.  It introduced the increase on 1 December, during what was, it is to be hoped, the busiest period for retailers.  It hit them in terms of sales and in terms of cumbersome administration.  I was a practising chartered accountant and I know from dealing with clients over many years what they need.  The Government does not understand the fundamentals of business.  One of these is that credit must flow.  People must have access to credit.We supported the Government's guarantee scheme because it was the right thing to do, but it did not follow up with the necessary proposals to build on it.  AIB was projecting a bad debt provision of between €2.9 billion and €4 billion for 2009, but we now find it will be €4.3 billion.  Three directors stated they would resign their posts, but tomorrow they are going forward for re-election.  It is a farce.  The Government is providing AIB with €3.5 billion of taxpayers' money.  The tail is wagging the dog.  The banks have been doing this for too long with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  What is now required is to get credit flowing.NAMA will not work.  There is enough undeveloped zoned residential land in Ireland at the moment to build 1 million units.  At 50,000 units a year, that is the equivalent of 20 years' supply.  The bulk of the money to buy this land was borrowed.  Building costs about €50,000 per site.  Of the €90 billion of development and investment loans, €62 billion — we were told this by the Financial Regulator in the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs — is in respect of undeveloped land.  Based on this we reach a figure of 1 million units of undeveloped land.  NAMA cannot get the value back in time.  It will lose taxpayers' money heavily and it will not bring about a flow of funds to small businesses.  The Minister of State talked about telling the banks that were given the Government guarantee scheme to give out funding.  This is supposed to put manners on the banks.  The banks are unable to function; they cannot get access to funds in international markets because the markets do not trust them.  This is reinforced by the fact that AIB is changing its figures on bad debts day by day.Fine Gael has put forward a proposal.  What the Government must do, working with the Financial Regulator, is to conduct proper stress testing of loans and then come back before the Oireachtas to update it on the situation and the long-term capital requirements.  It should then look to renegotiate with the bond holders so that the losses are shared.  Bond holders are trading on the international markets as we speak.  The Government should establish a State-sponsored wholesale bank, funded by the European Central Bank, which would provide funds to banks so they can lend to small business.  The wholesale bank could acquire those loans but allow the banks to administer them and get a management fee for doing so.  This would ensure that funds flow to small businesses.  NAMA will not do this.  All it will do, effectively, is to take €50 billion of taxpayers' money up front, with no guarantee that the money will come back; in fact, it will probably lose money.  It will not ensure the flow of funds to small businesses and mortgage holders.  The measures for small businesses in this Bill are disappointing.  The granting of a PRSI holiday to employers who maintain employees until the end of the year would encourage them to keep people on.  There should be a Government guaranteed loan scheme and, if necessary, the Government should provide the funds itself.  VAT rates should be reduced and PRSI exemptions introduced for employers who take on new employees.These measures should be straight forward but the penny has not dropped for this Government.  If credit does not flow to small businesses they cannot function.  Small businessmen and women feel they have been forgotten, even though they provide the bulk of employment.  They are being crucified on VAT, taxes, rates and other areas but the Government is offering them nothing to support job creation.  For every 1,000 people who lose their jobs, the cost to the State is €21 million.  We should be doing everything in our power to stop people losing their jobs.  There might be 500,000 on the live register by the end of the year.All we hear is the rhetoric that it is a global problem but the Government created this mess.  People are losing their jobs because of a lack of leadership.  People are not spending money but why would they when they know they will pay more and more tax because the Government is unwilling to put in place innovative proposals to sustain and generate employment?Section 2 of the Bill includes the composite rate to allow for the doubling of the income levy.  Now a single person on €36,400 will pay up to a 51% marginal rate.  A married couple on €45,400 will pay 51%, with all tax at the marginal rate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, should admit the composite rate was a drafting error.  The Government made a cock up.  How can the Minister for Finance say on budget day that the increases would apply from 1 May when the detailed resolutions provide for a composite rate?  People who are losing their jobs, with their income collapsing over the year, who might have got a bonus at the start of the year, will be asked to pay back-tax.  Is the Government seriously saying that a person who loses his or her job in the next few months, who happened to have income that brings him or her above the increased level for the income levy, will be expected to pay more tax?  The Government made a cock up and should admit it.  All it is doing here is compounding the error by trying to justify the unjustifiable.  Once again a mistake has been made.Everyone knows there is a recession but the fundamental problem is they do not believe the leadership and know-how exists to lead them out of it.  There is no business experience in the Government.  The only person with any knowledge of business was shown the door.  The problem with Deputy John McGuinness was, to paraphrase Jack Nicholson in "A Few Good Men", the Government could not handle the truth.  Deputy John McGuinness was telling it as it was and he was shown the door.The Irish people, however, agree with Deputy McGuinness, they agree the Government is making mistake after mistake and has caused a situation where we are now establishing a debt management agency for toxic debt.  I cannot understand why the Government cannot say there is a problem in the construction industry, it will not foist it on to the taxpayer, it will seek innovative ways to get funds flowing to small businesses, it will put effort into getting our export markets going again to make us competitive and that it will not do this on the backs of ordinary taxpayers.In 2005, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, even though the IMF and the Governor of the Central Bank warned we were over-reliant on the construction sector, he said the fundamentals were sound and we should build on.  Effectively, in league with the banks, he encouraged people to buy houses they could not afford.  Many young couples are now in negative equity and worried about losing their jobs.  We have people coming into us every day who are losing their jobs.  Husbands and wives are both losing their jobs, and their sons and daughters are losing their jobs.  Their main concern is meeting the mortgage repayments.  Many of them are on fixed rate mortgages at prohibitive rates.  They are wondering where alternative jobs will be generated.  There is no safety valve now of emigration to Britain and America because there are no jobs there.  The Government must deal with the problems it has created and come up with policies to deal with it.Fine Gael published a pre-budget submission that offered a way to deal with the present situation.  Unlike Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, which were heavily reliant on taxes, we believed there should be a balance of one third tax and two thirds savings because we cannot tax our way out of recession.  The Government has shown no knowledge of business, of how to free up credit or how the ordinary man might deal with this situation.The fact the Government could even consider removing the Christmas bonus demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of how much people are suffering.  It has hit the most vulnerable, it has hit ordinary lower and middle income taxpayers, the people who are struggling.The Government has also failed to introduce reforms.  When will we see the report of Mr. Colm McCarthy's public sector review group?  Why was that report not brought forward as a matter of urgency?  When will there be measures to get credit flowing for small businesses or a job creation document?  The Taoiseach claims he is willing to have informed debate on job creation but when will he welcome a debate in the House on the NewERA proposal document put forward by Fine Gael, which details the creation of 100,000 jobs in areas that would cover exports and the green economy?  Where is this Government bipartisanship?  When will the Government acknowledge its mistakes, admit it has made a mess and work with everyone to move forward?The Government must come up with measures to support small businesses.  The composite rate must be reversed and the increased levies should apply only from 1 May. The Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil they would apply from 1 May.  That is exactly what he stated.  It is critical the Government reconsiders the establishment of NAMA.  It will not work.  It will bankrupt taxpayers into the future and cost them between €50 billion and €90 billion.  It will not bring about the flow of credit to small businesses and mortgage holders that is so badly needed.  I look forward to the Minister's response.

At stake is €90 billion of taxpayer's money — three years' tax revenue — the international reputation of Ireland as a haven of cosy crony capitalism, the cost of international borrowing and the future health of the economy.Those are the words of Professor Brian Lucey of Trinity College, taken from what he wrote in an article in today's edition of The Irish Times describing the debate on this motion.  Such is the sheer scale of the problem in our banks, the implications for our economy and the losses that will be inflicted on our children and our grandchildren for decades to come by the Government’s bailout plan.This House is faced with a stark choice.  Will we live up to the principle set out in Article 45 of the Constitution where it states, "That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole," or will we pursue a course that risks imposing untold costs on the people as a whole?Throughout this economic crisis, there are two features that have distinguished Labour's approach to the economy.  First, we have made jobs our number one priority.  Again and again we have made the point that it is the real economy, and not just the public finances, that is the central issue.  Second, we have sought to protect the taxpayer from the consequences of Fianna Fáil's mishandling of the banking crisis.  Labour stood alone to vote against the banking guarantee.  We took some criticism for that decision, but events have proven that we were correct to do so.The motion before the House brings together these two central concerns.  Its purpose is to protect the real economy, as far as possible, from the effects of the banking crisis.  Our objective is to re-establish the flow of credit to the real economy — to jobs and businesses — in the fastest, most effective manner and, crucially, at least cost to the taxpayer.  We are not advancing bank nationalisation as part of an ideological agenda, but as an essential emergency measure.  This is not a decision to be contemplated lightly, but it is a necessary decision.Such is the scale of the economic calamity facing our country and such is the extent of damage done by Fianna Fáil's mismanagement of the economy, that we are left with no option.  The alternative — NAMA or an bord bailout — is a proposition that will burden our children and our grandchildren for decades to come.This motion proposes the temporary nationalisation of the institutions covered by the reckless banking guarantee as the quickest, most effective and least costly means of dealing with the banking crisis.  Its purpose is to ensure the restoration of credit to the Irish economy, which is vital to ensuring the survival of jobs and businesses.  The banks would be taken into public ownership for a limited period, during which time their balance sheets would be cleaned up, before being re-privatised at the earliest possible date.  This would involve substantial State investment but the amount would be far less than the NAMA approach.This is the solution to the banking crisis that is favoured by economists and banking experts from across a wide spectrum of opinion.  The case for temporary nationalisation was articulated clearly and convincingly by a group of 20 economists representing a wide range of political views.  It is also an approach that is gaining increasing international support.  This is not a matter of ideology — it is about brass tacks and how people will survive in the real economy.  It means putting aside vested interests and ideological blockages to deal with an economic emergency.Ireland is experiencing an economic contraction of unprecedented proportions.  Not since the 1930s has the economy of a developed country contracted to such an extent.  Unemployment is set to hit 17% next year — equivalent to a live register of more than 500,000 people.  Everywhere I go I hear again and again about the problems businesses are having getting access to credit.  Viable businesses and good jobs are being lost for the want of basic bank lending.The IMF has not only warned that Ireland's banking crisis will cost the State more than any other country, it has also pointed out that recessions associated with banking crises are generally deeper and longer lasting than any other downturns.  We must take this extremely seriously.  A decline of one tenth in national income is an enormous shock but our capacity to recover from it and to begin to grow again and to create new jobs will depend on having a functioning banking system.  We must address the banking crisis urgently and coherently.  In March alone, lending by the banks to non-financial corporates fell by approximately €1 billion.  This is a clear indication of how the banking crisis is having its impact on business.  Business needs credit to function.  It needs working capital.  It also needs to bridge the gap between dispatching an order and getting paid.  It needs to be able to pay suppliers and to have funds to meet its payroll.  It also needs credit to engage in international trade.We are eight months on from the banking guarantee but, instead of a coherent strategy, what we have had from Fianna Fáil is a series of blunders and U-turns.  The worst of these was the banking guarantee put in place on 30 September last year.  What was painted by Fianna Fáil as bold and decisive action was in fact the worst economic policy decision made by any Government since the economic war.  It tied the hands of the State in its dealings with the banks and it was implemented without the terms and conditions that should have been included.  Neither has this Fianna Fáil-led Government ever explained why Ireland's guarantee had to be so much wider than the guarantees offered by other countries.  Why, for example, was dated subordinated debt guaranteed in Ireland but nowhere else?  Why was the guarantee put in place instead of nationalising Anglo when that proposal was, I understand, on the Cabinet table that evening?Since that night, it has been the banks and not Government that have driven economic policy.  Whereas in the UK where the chairpersons and CEOs of the re-capitalised banks were gone overnight, in Ireland the same failed boards and management teams were left in place for months.  As Ireland's international reputation sank and our sovereign debt was downgraded, Fianna Fáil attacked pensioners but protected bankers.  It has only been through a process of scandal, revelation and attrition that senior bankers have stood down.  Even today, many remain in place.For months now, the Labour Party has been demanding regime change in the banks — the replacement of boards and senior management teams.  This is not a matter of personal attack but a matter of credibility. It is simply not credible to say that the people who brought the banks to this position can get them out of it.  As a simple matter of managerial credibility, there should by now have been a comprehensive clearout, not just to satisfy the public but to show a level of seriousness to the international financial markets.Our proposal is that this process should be supervised by a banking commission.  This would be made up of people of the highest international reputation; people whom the international markets would trust to oversee the process and whose reputation would assist in rebuilding ours.  Instead, Fianna Fáil has invented an bord bailout — NAMA — an agency that will buy up property developers' loans from the banks and make the taxpayer liable for their losses.  It will do this without insisting on regime change in the senior management of the bank and expose the taxpayer to potentially enormous losses.Once the bank guarantee was put in place, the Irish State effectively became responsible for the bad debts of the covered banks.  That is a reality and we have to face up to it.Unless action is taken to deal with the bad loans, Ireland risks the zombie bank syndrome, where banks attempt to nurse their bad loans, avoiding write-downs and lack the capacity to engage in lending that would support productive activity.As the Labour Party has consistently argued, therefore, it is necessary to find a means to deal with the bad loans, so that they do not act as a drag on the rest of the financial system.  How this is achieved, however, has potentially enormous consequences for the taxpayer and the economy.  A key issue is how the losses are apportioned between the taxpayer and the banks.  In the "Bord Bail-out" model, the loans are bought from the banks at some unspecified discount from their nominal value.  Given the state of the Irish economy and the property market in Ireland and overseas, it would be extremely difficult to achieve a fair assessment of the value of the loans.  The higher the price paid by an Bord Bail-out, the greater the loss carried by the taxpayer.  The lower the price paid, the greater the loss borne by the bank, but this would be likely to trigger the need for further investment by the State in the bank.  Since the Government says it is committed to obtaining ordinary shares in return for further recapitalisation, the State could eventually end up owning a majority of the banks.  Given the pattern of events so far, there are grounds for believing that the State will simply overpay and enormous losses will be transferred to the taxpayer.It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by the 20 economists who wrote on this issue in The
Irish Times. The article states:There is . . . a fundamental internal contradiction in the Government's current position. The Government is claiming that it can simultaneously: (a) purchase the bad loans at a discount reflecting their true market value; (b) keep the banks well or adequately capitalised; and (c) keep them out of State ownership.These three outcomes are simply mutually incompatible, and we are greatly concerned that the NAMA process may operate to maintain the appearance that all three objectives have been achieved by failing to meet the first requirement. This would arise if NAMA purchases the bad loans at a discount — but still well above market value.With €90 billion in loans to be purchased, the consequences to the taxpayer of overpaying for bad assets by 10 to 30 per cent are truly appalling.Knowing what we know about the Fianna Fáil record on this issue, and its determination to favour the banks over the taxpayer at every opportunity, we have every reason to fear that the economists' prediction will be proven correct.  The alternative approach is to temporarily nationalise the banks.  This avoids the requirement to value the bad loans in this highly uncertain environment.  The State would take ownership of the loans and the banks.  The process of writing down the bad loans would be vigorously pursued and the normal lending would be resumed.I would envisage that units would be established within the banks to deal with the bad loans.  That would be sensible business practice.  As many of the loans are likely to be syndicated, a clearing house mechanism may also be required to deal with them and to minimise the legal costs involved in dealing with them.  If a developer owes money to a number of institutions, all owned by the State, it makes sense that they be dealt with on an integrated basis.  Ultimately, there could be a transfer of outstanding loans to a clearing house, or transfer of loans between State-owned banks.  This would be a transfer from one State-owned institution to another, removing the risk to the State of having to value the bad loans.  Once the banks' balance sheets had been cleaned up, the State would return the banks to the market.  The return to the State from the resale of the banks would significantly offset the cost of bad loans that the State is required to pick up.One point which the debate on the banking crisis tends to miss is the importance of avoiding delay.  The longer it takes to achieve a resolution, the more businesses and jobs will be lost.  While Fianna Fáil is attempting to set up an Bord Bail-out on an interim basis, it will in fact be extremely difficult for it to start work without a legislative framework to underpin it.  Without a legislative basis for NAMA, the bank will be obliged to have regard to customer confidentiality.  A non-statutory State agency cannot simply send people into the banks to start picking over loan documents unless they have adequate authority to do so.  Indeed, it is questionable whether the Financial Regulator would even be in a position to hand over the PWC report to a non-statutory NAMA, without adequate supporting legislation.There is a clear legal risk that the Bord Bail-out model will be dragged out and delayed in its implementation.  Yet, until a solution is put in place, normal lending activity will remain on hold.  Indeed, there may be areas where banks delay making sensible and viable loans because they believe that the loan might be transferred to NAMA and all the time, businesses are going to the wall, and jobs are being lost.When Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised, the State initiated an assessment of the value of the bank and is committed to compensating shareholders for the value of the business, if any, that it took over.  Of course, the State cannot simply seize the banks' shares. Shareholders have suffered through the poor management of the banks and it is appropriate to examine ways in which those losses can be mitigated.  The State should establish, therefore, a trust or other mechanism, which would allow shareholders to retain an interest in the bank.  Instead of cashing the cheque for the value of their shares, they could be given the option of putting their money into trust, to be converted into shares in the bank when it is reprivatised.  The State should be proactive in looking at ways of giving shareholders some potential upside if they leave their investment with the banks.  This could be as simple as an option to receive shares later or there may be other ways in which shareholders could enjoy some future upside.Fianna Fáil is currently arguing that the State cannot directly run banks.  No one is proposing that it should.  The banks would continue to operate in a commercial environment and with a commercial mandate.  The Taoiseach is arguing that nationalised banks would be subject to political interference.  I see no reason this has to be the case, even with Fianna Fáil still in office.  Rules and structures can be put in place to avoid political interference in the day-to-day running of the banks and the aim will be to return the banks to private ownership as soon as possible.The Labour Party has proposed the establishment of a banking commission that would appoint the boards of the banks.  The banking commission would be independent of Government and would be made up of people of the highest international reputation — some of whom should not be Irish.  By bringing in people of calibre to oversee some key banking functions, we can contribute to the painstaking task of rebuilding our reputation abroad.Fianna Fáil has also argued, or rather it has spun the line, that international markets will not lend to nationalised banks but it has yet to produce evidence to support this claim.  Fianna Fáil is effectively arguing that the banks would not be able to borrow without State support and they will not be able to borrow with State ownership. How does that possibly make sense?  The idea is also foreign to the IMF which argued in a recent report:Insolvent institutions (with insufficient cash flows) should be closed, merged, or temporarily placed in public ownership until private sector solutions can be developed. While permanent public ownership of core banking institutions would be undesirable from a number of perspectives, there have been numerous instances (for example, Japan, Sweden and the United States), where a period of public ownership has been used to cleanse balance sheets and pave the way to sales back to the private sector.Is Fianna Fáil saying the IMF is wrong on this also?  There is a need for honesty here.  We need to face up to some realities, politically and as a country.  The guarantee is in place.  Fianna Fáil brought it in and I regret to say that Fine Gael and Sinn Féin voted for it.  It effectively means that the State has to deal with the bad loans of the banks.  We can do that through NAMA, or we can nationalise.  One is slower and more expensive than the other but as a country, we have to demonstrate that we recognise this, and are ready to deal with it.  We have to stand up, admit that there is a problem, fire the people who were directly responsible for it, and start dealing with it.  That is what this motion proposes.In any crisis, no matter how severe, there is always a road to recovery.  There are always critical first steps that can and should be taken, to face up to the problem honestly, to take the first decisions that, even if painful, mean that we are moving in the right direction again.   For the Irish economy, sorting out the banking crisis is one of those critical first steps.  As the IMF has pointed out, recessions related to financial crises are generally longer and deeper than recessions caused by other factors.  Restoring the flow of credit in the Irish economy is essential to protect jobs, create new ones, and stop the ongoing destruction of businesses that are otherwise viable.  That is why we in the Labour Party have put action on the banking crisis at the heart of our jobs action plan.This motion is not advanced on ideological grounds but in the interests of protecting jobs.  I appeal to all the parties in this House to face up to the consequences of their actions last October and to begin to deal with this problem now by supporting the Labour Party motion for the temporary nationalisation of the banks.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I appeal to the Government to rethink its latest decision on the banking crisis.  I repeat my conviction that the NAMA, in the context announced, is wrong for the economy and the taxpayer.  Surely the Minister for Finance must wonder why not a single independent commentator of any stature has come out in support of his position.  Yet, as Deputy Gilmore said, a substantial body of independent commentary advocates temporary nationalisation of the two big banks rather than going down the NAMA route as proposed by the Government.The Government's failure to rebut the case for temporary nationalisation is very worrying.  The ministerial arguments for the NAMA are merely assertions and do not engage with the case set out by different academics and banking experts.  Most worrying of all was the piece in The Irish Times a couple of weeks ago by Dr. Alan Ahearne, who is now advising the Minister.  Dr. Ahearne’s only substantial argument is the assertion that, if nationalised, the two big banks may not be able to source money on the international inter-bank markets.  He produced no evidence for this somewhat extraordinary contention that banks backed by the State would be less likely to source funds than private banks of doubtful solvency.  We know that State owned banks already successfully access funding on the international markets.  Is it seriously being suggested that a nationalised bank would be refused funding by international banks but a bank that is owned 70% by the State would be successful?Neither has the Minister told us how, in the present environment, it is proposed under his model to price the assets being stripped out of the banks.  The prospect of the usual suspects being let loose on €90 billion worth of taxpayers' money will eventually, when understood, bring people onto the streets.  The Government is playing with almost three times the annual tax take.  The men in sharp suits will do what they always do, and this time with knobs on, because the trading will be underwritten by the taxpayer.  Already some of the shakers and movers are removing the "good" bad assets from the covered institutions and placing them with banks not headquartered in this jurisdiction.  There is nothing to prevent them doing this and further disadvantaging the taxpayer.  They are also engaged in restructuring the ownership of some built and half built developments to enable the NAMA to be stymied and obstructed when it comes to take over these assets.The Bacon proposals are a nightmare for the taxpayer, the economy, employment and, eventually, for the Government.  Mr. Peter Bacon has made a very poor fist of defending his proposals.  It appears as if he had been given instructions that whatever he came up with, he was not to suggest nationalising AIB and Bank of Ireland.  That appears to have become an article of faith with the Government although it is not clear why.  Is it because Bank of Ireland has about 80,000 share holders and AIB 90,000, approximately 76,000 of them in the Republic?  The Labour Party is not arguing for the confiscation of the shareholders' stake and clearly, as Deputy Gilmore said, some acceptable provision would have to be made for their interest.  However, fear of the electoral wrath of shareholders is not an especially strong argument for persisting with a formula that will squeeze the Irish taxpayer for the next generation.The Minister for Finance must know that the challenge of pricing the bad assets where frequently there is no market while the banks remain partially in private ownership is fraught with pitfalls.  If the bad assets are overpriced the taxpayer pays the price.  On the other hand, if the bad assets are properly diluted, the banks will require further recapitalisation and the taxpayer will again have to pay up.  In contrast, temporary nationalisation offers the prospect of the taxpayer benefiting from the upside when normality returns.  The challenge of acquiring the bad assets and tangling with the banks and developers to do so is the most difficult task yet undertaken by the State.  It is a task, according to one writer in The Sunday Business Post that would require 700 specialist staff.  The whole thing is unthinkable.The Labour Party leader has already today drawn the Taoiseach's attention to the truth that temporary nationalisation is not a proposal from the Labour Party alone.  The IMF, for example, has said:Insolvent institutions (with insufficient cash flows) should be closed, merged, or temporarily placed in public ownership until private sector solutions can be developed.  While permanent public ownership of core banking institutions would be undesirable from a number of perspectives, there have been numerous instances (for example, Japan, Sweden and the United States), where a period of public ownership has been used to cleanse balance sheets and pave the way to sales back to the private sector.That is the view not of the Irish Labour Party only, but of the IMF.  Other agencies at home and internationally have expressed similar views.  Some 20 academics from the Dublin universities with no vested interests have vehemently contested the NAMA approach as structured and argued for temporary nationalisation.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance can reach for any independent approval of the Government's approach.Today the Taoiseach made the odd statement that he did not believe in assuming any more responsibility than is necessary at the time.  But this is not a pay-by-instalments scheme.  If we give legislative underpinning for the road embarked on by the Government, much of the damage will be done and much of the cost will have been borne by the time nationalisation becomes inevitable.  It is always interesting that the Government has not ruled out temporary nationalisation.  It is just that, like our former colleague, Dinny Foley, the Government is "hoping against hope" that it will not happen.  The problem is that if nationalisation is forced on us, and most experts think it will be, we will already have borne a huge part of the cost.Nor can I see the merit in the Fine Gael amendment which similarly seeks to avoid what it calls "early nationalisation" on the basis that it would essentially extend the guarantee beyond 2010.  Surely we have to admit that, whether we like it or not, the guarantee will inevitably be extended beyond 2010.  The back-up notes to the budget effectively signalled as much when it was recorded that,"The Government also intends in line with its previous indication to put a State guarantee in place for the future issuance of debt securities with a maturity of up to five years."  This may or may not add to the overall stock of guaranteed liabilities but it must inevitably extend the guarantee for at least part of that stock.  I fail to see how the fear of extending the guarantee beyond 2010 is a reason for not facing up to the big question now.If I have only one minute, will the Ceann Comhairle permit me to put on the record a quote from the Taoiseach, which fits in with his incremental approach today about not accepting responsibility for something until one has to?  On 30 September 2008 he told the House:The point I am making and the commitment I am giving is that in the event of having worked out whatever had to happen in relation to those banks, and if a deficit emerged, the sector would pay, not the Irish taxpayer.  That is my commitment to the House.I repeat the Minister's word, "That is my commitment to the House, that the sector would pay, not the taxpayer".We know the truth now.  The sector is not able to pay and the taxpayer is being squeezed to death.  The road the Government has embarked on with the NAMA approach will squeeze the taxpayer further.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me and, on behalf of my party, I support the motion before the House today.An extract from an article in the Financial Times of 25 April reads:The problems of banks are much deeper than were then acknowledged and the destabilisation of the economy has happened anyway.  Government now provides taxpayers' money to financial businesses in previously unimaginable quantities.  But there is no control over the use of the money, no insistence on structural reform or management reorganisation, no safeguarding of the essential economic functions of the financial services industry and no accountability for the damage that has been done.This was written by John Kay of the Financial Times about the British Labour Party’s love affair with the banks across the water but his description of the British Government’s approach sounds remarkably similar to the approach taken here by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.  Since the time of the so-called “cheapest bailout” in the world last September, the Government has made five attempts to deal with the banking crisis and has failed on each occasion.  Between botched recapitalisation last December, the infamous nationalisation of the toxic Anglo-Irish Bank, or the most recent adventure in the form of NAMA, the Government is pouring away billions of euros of Irish taxpayers’ money, without any accountability, any clear direction and without a plan, in an attempt to reorganise the banking system.However, this is not Monopoly money with which the Government can play around but is based on our public finances, namely, the taxes of the next generation of working people.  The Government has cut back on numerous programmes such as special needs teachers, temporary workers in our health services and, recently, early child benefit, in an attempt to balance the books.  While it is doing this and reminding us of the difficult times we face, it is giving unprecedented quantities of public money to our zombie banks, those same banks that told us they would die before accepting recapitalisation.  These are the banks that refuse to provide credit to our SMEs, that ignore requests to return their billions of euro in pensions and bonuses, that dragged their heels in bringing wholesale changes in personnel.  The Government has prioritised this sector and the clique that controls it over our children with special needs, our pensioners who are dependent on their Christmas bonus and over patients in our hospitals.  Many of this clique are now taking their retirement.  Even today, there was Ulster Bank's chief economist who will now go off with his pals to play golf and meet people for lunch while we are left with the devastating mess the banks created.The public's confidence in this Government's ability to address the financial crisis is at rock bottom.  The public, very many independent economists and the Members on this side of the House are opposed to the establishment of NAMA because the taxpayer will be made to pay for the reckless lending and borrowing of bankers and property speculators.  The Government’s approach, namely, to buy distressed assets while ensuring that our banks are adequately capitalised while resisting full nationalisation, is contradictory.  By paying too little for the bad assets in the banks’ loan books, the banks will require further recapitalisation which will inevitably lead to further public ownership of the banks.  By paying over the odds for assets that have rapidly decreased in value, the taxpayer will assume major losses.  Twenty senior economists recently stated, “With €90 billion in loans to be purchased, the consequences to the taxpayer of overpaying the assets by 10 to 30 per cent are truly appalling”.Even if the Government has its way in creating NAMA and buying bad debt with public money, we will still be left with little or no stake in the banks at the end of this fiasco.  The Government has provided no real justification for resisting nationalisation.  The truth is that it is opposed to public ownership of our banks because of ideology and ultra-conservatism.  There is no evidence that public banks will be denied interbank liquidity yet the Government insists that the banks should not be nationalised.  What makes this all the more alarming is that, while it opposes public involvement in the banks, it is more than willing to use public money to bail them out.The Minister has not been given a mandate to do whatever he likes, thereby crippling this country with massive debts.  He never mentioned this in his election manifesto in 2007.  The Taoiseach abused his position by fuelling the property bubble which led to the collapse in this market in the first place.Although a change in direction would look like another U-turn I urge the Government to listen to the Opposition and scrap the NAMA project once and for all.  I hope I am wrong, but I truly believe that NAMA will be the worst mistake we have ever made.  If my fears are realised the Government will go down in history as the worst Government in the history of the State.  The backbenchers and the Green Party — who are now nothing more than Progressive Democrats who like trees — must recognise that they are just as responsible for this mess as the Government is.  The Green Party can no longer deny responsibility for this economic crisis.  It now presides over a regime of cutbacks matched only by those made by the former Tánaiste, Michael McDowell, and his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats.  The Green Party has changed its policy completely from that it adopted when it was on this side of the House claiming to aspire to social justice.  Its true colours are coming out now and they are certainly not green.While the Minister allows our banks to cripple us and occupy all of the Government's focus, the real economy  — our SMEs and working people — is being ignored.  These people are going to the wall and workers are being laid off.  The dole queues resemble those of the 1980s.  All of us in this House can remember those terrible times.The Government should deal with the banking issue once and for all.  It must broaden its focus to include retention and creation of jobs.  It must take on board some of the proposals made by parties on this side of the House.  I refer in particular to the Sinn Féin pre-budget submission which set out a strategy for helping SMEs to retain jobs.  It is obviously much easier to retain jobs than to create them.  The Government has shown no inclination to do this.  It is little wonder that people outside this House are disillusioned with politics and political leadership here.The Government, which is charged with administering the State in this Parliament, totally ignores the Opposition.  This is a time when I would have expected the Government to declare it would discuss these matters openly and sensibly and come to a type of consensus on what we can do to resolve this matter, if that is at all possible.  Instead, we have a situation where the Government does not even accept a simple amendment to its Finance Bill.I look forward to the debate on that Bill tomorrow.  I commend the Labour Party on bringing this motion before the House today and giving us an opportunity to debate it on the floor of the House.

I am also glad of the opportunity to correct some very mischievous and politically motivated rhetoric emanating from various quarters on the subject of our banks.First, I wish to repeat that at all times in its approach to the banking crisis, the primary concern of this Government has been to stabilise and support our banking sector so that it can ensure a flow of credit into the economy which will allow business to flourish and workers to stay in their jobs.  Like governments all over the world, we have intervened promptly and decisively to maintain our banking system.  In the wake of the collapse of Lehmans Brothers we introduced the bank guarantee scheme and we did so in the teeth of sustained opposition from the Labour Party, which has sponsored this motion.We have continued to support our banking system through the nationalisation of Anglo-Irish Bank, the recapitalisation of our two main banks and most recently through the proposal to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  Every country in the world has had to make repeated interventions in response to this evolving banking crisis.  That is what the situation has demanded.  I have heard time and again Labour Party spokespersons denounce us for our repeated interventions as if there was one single piece of wizardry to deal with this most intractable crisis in the history of modern banking.  I know Deputy Burton suffers from no lack of self-belief but I suggest a little self doubt in this instance would not go astray.Nationalisation of the whole of the Irish banking system, which is what is being proposed in the motion, will not be the short-term panacea that some envisage.  Wholesale nationalisation would do absolutely nothing to resolve to the banks' bad debt problems and get credit flowing again to support economic recovery and jobs.  Nationalisation may change the brass plate, but it does not provide the individual institution with any additional funding or any resolution of the bad debt problems which cripple our financial institutions.  While I accept that many in this House will have different political views on a question relating to banking, the Government believes that it is important, where possible, that the banking sector maintains a market presence and that it operates within market disciplines and constraints.The Government's objective is to ensure that the lending needs of the real economy are met.  A commercially focused banking system, which includes banks having a market presence, operating within market disciplines and constraints, is best equipped to achieve this aim.  This is not a position held no matter what the cost, but is rather a balanced approach to the existing circumstances.  Indeed, we have nationalised one of the three main financial institutions and have taken 25% public ownership in the Bank of Ireland.  Tomorrow it may be the case that we will have taken 25% of Allied Irish Banks into public ownership as well, following its extraordinary general meeting.  It is not a simple matter of suggesting that there is a stark contrast between the total nationalisation of the institutions concerned and the continued private ownership of them.  The reality is that in the case of the three main institutions the State has already nationalised one of them, and in the case of the other two, it envisages 25% public participation in each.I made it clear in my recent Supplementary Budget Statement that any further State capital introduced into these institutions would require the issuance of ordinary shares, which would, inevitably mean a greater degree of public participation in these financial institutions.  Indeed one of the more careless features of the motion before the House is that it suggests the nationalisation of mutual building societies, which are covered institutions, and which do not require that type of approach.  The Government's objective is to ensure that the lending needs of the real economy are met.  A commercially focused banking system, which includes banks having a market presence, operating within market disciplines and constraints is best equipped to achieve this aim.  It is not a position being held no matter what the cost, but is a balanced approach.The Labour Party is ignoring clear international evidence that wholly wholesale nationalised banking systems serve their economies poorly.  The evidence shows that compared with commercially focused banking systems, nationalised banks charge higher interest rates to businesses and households, provide less credit to the economy and discriminate against small and medium sized businesses. Higher interest rates and less credit are not what our banking system needs.  Banks all over the world are struggling with damaged balance sheets, yet no country is currently adopting a policy of wholesale bank nationalisation in this banking crisis except Iceland.  I presume the Labour Party does not want me to repeat the name of that country in the course of this debate.  There is no immediate reason for Ireland to adopt such a policy.  If Ireland was uniquely to proceed down that route it could, from an international perspective, be very damaging to its reputation and attractiveness to international investors, not only from the perspective of the provision of funding to the banking sector but from that of international investment more generally.We have, of course, nationalised Anglo Irish Bank because of the weakening of its funding position and critically, because of the damage done to its reputation by the reprehensible actions of some of its former directors.  Unlike the other covered institutions, recapitalisation alone could not have secured the viability of this bank.  It is crucial to note, however, that nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank has not meant that its funding and capital position has been any better than it would have been had it not been nationalised.  The fact is that now, the burden of funding this bank rests exclusively with the State.While the range of measures the Government has already introduced have gone a long way to supporting the banking sector and ensuring its stability, it has become clear that Ireland, like many developed countries around the world, will need further measured and appropriate action.  That is why the Government decided that the asset position of the banking system must also be addressed.  Accordingly, the Government decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency on a statutory basis, under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency.I note press reports today that the German Government will tomorrow announce details of plans to set up asset management companies in Germany to take illiquid assets off banks' balance sheets.  The German asset management agencies will share many features of the NAMA.  Indeed, Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany have a similar policy in relation to this issue and we are acting on the best advice not alone of the Central Bank and our professional advisers, but also on the advice of best international practice.The objective of the National Asset Management Agency is to strengthen the banks' balance sheets which will considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and as a consequence ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to the real economy, to protect and grow employment while also protecting the interest of taxpayers.  The potential book value of loans that will be transferred to the NAMA is in the region of €80 billion to €90 billion, although the amount paid by the agency will be considerably less than this. It is important to emphasise that the State will not take all of the risk in the acquisition of such assets.  The price of the assets will have regard to current and expected market value of the relevant assets and what is sustainable for the taxpayer.  In the longer term, if the agency were to fall short of recouping all of the costs, the Government intends that a levy should be applied to recoup any shortfall incurred.Many commentators and Deputies on the other side of the House who have criticised the NAMA, have acknowledged that the crucial issue here is the valuation of the assets.  I am not going to rush into devising a formula for the valuation of these assets.  I shall seek the widest possible expert advice on this subject.  Indeed, I would welcome the views of those on the other side of the House and commentators on the appropriate method of valuing the assets.  The valuation of the assets is the most crucial decision that will have to be taken in respect of the national asset management agency.  It is not a decision to be rushed into.  Yes, there is urgency about cleaning up the banks' balance sheets and restoring credit to the economy, but great care must be exercised in devising the formula for the valuation of the assets.Significant further detailed work and extensive due diligence on the loans books will be needed to ensure that the appropriate categories or portfolios of loans are transferred and that the banks are cleared of the identified riskiest loan portfolios.  The riskiest identified loan category for banks in Ireland is "Land and Development" and the largest related aggregate exposures across the institutions.  Entire portfolios of loans will be transferred to the agency.  This will provide the banks with stronger balance sheets and considerably reduced uncertainty over bad debts.The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its measured response to the recent turbulence in the banking sector.  Specialist expertise will be procured by the  National Asset Management Agency in all relevant areas to ensure that the agency is established in the most  efficient manner so as to safeguard the interest of the taxpayers.  I want to nail the lie that this agency is some form of bail out for bankers and developers.  Make no mistake, developers will continue to be required to repay their loans in full.  Where borrowers have made losses, they will have to recognise and take such losses and it will certainly not be the function of the agency to go easy on them.  The agency will operate on a full commercial basis and will be determined to recover monies owed to it to the fullest extent possible.  We will not be deterred by legal strategies which may be adopted by some of those affected.  The Government must act in the best interests of the economy as a whole.That requires that we up-front these losses.  I have heard Deputies on the other side of the House talking about zombie banks and the experience of Japan.  If we want to avoid that experience we must ensure that the losses are absorbed up-front by the financial institutions so that, in the fastest possible period, they can be restored to clean balance sheets and be in a position to lend as normal banks.  The degree of risk to the taxpayer bears an obvious relationship to the amount of the losses concerned.

However, our examination of the banks has gone beyond that.  Of the three largest institutions, we now wholly own one and we either have or are about to have a substantial participation in the other two.  I accept that we have gone far beyond where we envisaged we would be when the guarantee was issued last September.  There has been a global banking crisis and the State has intervened dramatically in the Irish banking sector.  To date, no plausible alternative policy has been advocated on the other side of the House as to how we should address these issues.It was important to intervene to protect depositors and to restore confidence in the Irish banking system by giving a guarantee for a defined period.  It was also important to examine the loan portfolios and decide that a certain level of capital was required in them.  In the case of one institution, it was important that we nationalise it and it is important that we set up an agency to clean the balance sheets, while protecting the interests of the taxpayers.As Deputy Rabbitte indicated, the question of valuation is crucial in this exercise.  It is we who will have to fix that valuation.  It cannot be a matter of negotiation with the institutions concerned.  That is why legislation will be required to back up the work of the agency.  In the interim, a great deal of practical work can be done.The stream of income from the assets and the proceeds from the eventual sale of the underlying asset or the repayment of the loan will accrue to the agency. This will be used to pay interest on the bonds issued to pay for the assets and eventually to repay these bonds.The agency will be developed and implemented within the common EU framework detailed in the European Commission guidance on the treatment of impaired assets, working closely with the European Commission to obtain prior State aid approval.  By drawing on the best advice and experience available, we are committed to ensuring that this very significant measure will be an example of best practice and meets all of the objectives that the Government has set for it.  We have always been guided by the need to protect the taxpayer.  This will also be the case in the implementation of the National Asset Management Agency.  In developing its actions and supports to date, the Government has earned an appropriate return from the banking system.The charge for the guarantee will realise a fee income of around €1 billion over the two years of the existing scheme.  The annual dividend on the €7 billion preference shares will be 8% which will return €560 million in a full year to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Furthermore, if the preference shares are not redeemed within five years, they will subsequently be redeemed at 125% of par value. The preference shares also have warrants attached, giving the State an option to buy shares in five years at a predetermined price thus providing it with the potential for a significant return.  Given the recent rise in bank shares, the State already appears to be capable of making such a return on the warrants associated with the capitalisation.  In addition, the Government's recapitalisation proposals include various measures on credit supply and requirements on the banks to deal in an appropriate manner with their customers.Stabilising the banking situation is necessary but in itself it will not be sufficient to restore the economy to its previous health.  We must address the issue of the public finances and the wider issue of competitiveness.  The actions which have been taken in order to stabilise the public finances have ensured that the general Government deficit does not exceed 10.75% of GDP in 2009.  That is a rowing back from a figure of 15%.  It is still at a high level but it is the most appropriate target for the year, given the current conditions in the Irish economy.The recent supplementary budget sets out a medium term plan and this strategy has received the backing of the EU Commission.  These difficult measures are necessary to protect the future growth of the country.  In taking these decisive steps the Government has taken into account not just short term needs, but the fact that the measures introduced this year and over the coming years are of fundamental importance to the future of the country.

It strongly suggests that the wisdom now available in hindsight was not as obvious to parties opposite then.  Their programmes bought into standard growth projections and most of their criticism then took the form of repeating endlessly that the country was awash with money and that Government should be spending and investing more and taxing less.The Government is, today, trenchantly criticised by many commentators, including some in the print media, which played a full part, in colour supplements, in hyping up the property boom, a principal cause of our banking difficulties.  They are now facing some of the same problems as the State, namely, the yawning gap between falling revenue and an over-ambitious level of expenditure.The principal objective of the Government is to stabilise the economy, employment, the public finances and the banking system.  Two US Democrat state senators paid a courtesy call on me in my office yesterday.  They commented that the media coverage here was just like at home and that their critics, like ours, underplayed the global factors in the crisis and wanted, in the same simplistic manner, to heap all the blame on — in their case — the state majority.Before speaking more specifically on the banks I wish to declare an interest.  One of my daughters is in middle management in AIB, albeit on maternity leave since last December.Since last September, we have had to take an array of measures to protect our banking system, including the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  As a general rule, nationalisation should be a last resort.  We have gone rapidly from a situation where our main banks were among the most profitable and deemed to be among the most dependable of our private commercial institutions.  I have no doubt that despite the traumatic and chastening developments of the last six months, they can become profitable and dependable again without ever returning to recent excesses.  As a condition of guaranteeing deposits and recapitalising the banks, the State, as set out in detail by the Minister, will earn a significant return on its investment and, indeed, has the potential of gaining substantially from the acquisition of the assets that represent bad debts at this time.Nationalisation means taking over uncritical responsibility for bad debts without first settling a price for them.  It means having to fund all the institutions in question.  It will create far greater financial pressure for amalgamations and redundancies.  It would not provide any short cut to easier credit, given that the State needs to maintain its financial credibility.  Small business is under great pressure from bankers and from both debtors and creditors.  Nationalisation is not a short cut for solving these problems, addressing which is built into the Government's approach to its role vis-à-vis the banks.While I accept that the alternative policy to the Government's, of wholesale nationalisation even if temporary in intent, is advocated by people coming from a wide range of directions, the Labour Party and those trade union leaders who share the same view are motivated in part by this unexpected opportunity to validate a democratic socialist ideology.  I am not suggesting that the Labour Party would, necessarily, follow that if it were in Government.  While I have as little time as the Labour Party for cavalier capitalism and ultra forms of neoliberalism that, in their folly, were until recently propagating the notion that the State, now so visibly needed, was practically redundant, the answer is not a reversion to 1970s style socialism.  We need a healthy, balanced, social market economy with neither adjective, social or market, deleted.  If we were to depart from this, it would represent a major change in direction and damage investor confidence.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance stated, only Iceland has adopted the path advocated by the Labour Party in this crisis and we are not in that category.Humanity has a regrettable tendency to extrapolate, indefinitely into the future, either boom and bloom or doom and gloom.  The reality is that we are in the most severe phase of an economic cycle and we should not do anything to prolong the day when recovery begins for us.  There will always be economic cycles.  Some weeks ago I was much cheered by a businessman in his late 60s who owns several retail shops when he stated outside church, "Please God, we will live to see the next depression."
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Everyone in the House accepts there is a need for a properly functioning banking system which meets the needs of the economy.  We also accept that resolving the current issues in the banking system is a prerequisite to economic recovery taking root.  However, we seem to differ in the best way to achieve that goal.The backdrop to the motion is an unprecedented crisis in the global banking system.  However, there is nothing in the motion dealing with the substantive problems in the banking system, that is, the overhang of property related loans and the need for major capital injections into the banks.  The motion does not address these issues because it would be politically unpopular for the Labour Party to do so.Recently, I heard the leader of the Labour Party on local radio in Cork during a visit.  He put out the simplistic, populist and misleading line that Fianna Fáil had plundered people's pockets to bail out the banks and the developers.  We have heard variations of this line from various Labour Party spokespersons in recent weeks as part of a clear communications strategy designed to damage the Government.  The reality is that when the banking system was on the brink of catastrophe last September, it was the Government, supported by Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, which had the courage to address the imminent danger.  The Labour Party took the easy option at the time and said "No."  A collapse of our banking system would have brought down the whole economy.  Although the situation seems to be bad, it would have been a good deal worse if the banking system had been allowed to implode.  Does the Labour Party really believe the top bankers wanted to come on bended knee with cap in hand to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance last September and put themselves and their colleagues at the mercy of the Government for many years to come?  No, they did not.  They came to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance because they had to.  They had no choice and were facing an urgent and immediate crisis.  It is because of the decision we took to guarantee the banks that no Irish banking institution has collapsed, unlike developments in many developed economies throughout the world.I wish to address the second populist suggestion consistently made by the Labour Party, that is, that we are in some way bailing out the developers.  The next contributor from the Labour Party should explain the allegation and charges made.  The impression is being created that developers will in some way have loans written off, which is simply not the case.  Developers are not being bailed out by the NAMA proposal.  In fact, developers are fearful of NAMA because it will force them to face up to their loans.  They will either have to repay their loans in full to NAMA or face the possibility of having the underlying security provided for the loan seized by the agency and put to use by the State.To date, the banks have largely taken a softly, softly approach towards large-scale developers with sizeable loans.  They have allowed interest to roll forward to avoid having to crystalise very substantial losses on the property loans on their books.  The NAMA approach will address that issue comprehensively.  If this were such a good deal for developers, why were there media reports last weekend of meetings between property developers to co-ordinate their strategy to oppose the NAMA proposal?  There were also comments from the Construction Industry Federation expressing its concerns about the NAMA plan.The bad loans are paralysing the banking system and must be dealt with quickly.  They are clogging up the banking system and need to be removed to an asset management company as a matter of priority.  The Government announcement of the establishment of NAMA has forced the hand of the banks.  Yesterday, there was an announcement by Allied Irish Banks that it had increased its bad debt write-off this year to €4.3 billion.  That increase is a direct result of the Government forcing the banks' hand, putting pressure on them to face up to these loans and not allowing the bad debts to continue to sit on the books and clog up the banking system.Nationalisation of the banks would do nothing to deal with these impaired assets and would not address the funding issue in the banks.  Deputy Gilmore called for the immediate nationalisation and cleaning up of the banks.  Presumably, he was referring to the need for the banks to face up to the bad property loans and write them off.  However, if this were done without recapitalising the banks, the capital base of the main Irish banks would be absolutely wiped out.  To suggest otherwise is to blatantly mislead the people.  At least, Deputy Gilmore had the honesty to admit tonight that the Labour Party motion would result in very significant State investment in the banking system.  He should go further and quantify the extent to which immediate, temporary nationalisation, without recapitalisation, would result in State investment in the banks.  That point should be clarified.The Minister for Finance has shown real courage in dealing with the banking crisis.  He averted immediate danger by guaranteeing customer deposits and certain bank liabilities last September, recapitalising Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, nationalising Anglo Irish Bank when its practices had sapped the confidence of the markets and it clearly required immediate nationalisation, and announcing the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency to clean up the balance sheets of the banks.  The call for temporary nationalisation shows no regard for the implications for existing shareholders, including institutional investors and pension funds, and does not take into consideration the devastating signal such a move would send to the international markets.We all recognise that the banks engaged in excessive lending, that they over-extended themselves during the Celtic tiger years and that they recklessly exposed themselves to the property market.  It is also clear the regulatory system for banking must be overhauled.  In this regard, I welcome the Government's move to establish a central banking commission such that the prudential regulation of the banking system can be properly controlled.  Is is clear the relationship between the behaviour of individual banks and consequent implications for the wider economy must be at the centre of the new regulatory system.Catchy one-liners will not resolve the issues in the banking system.  Clear and decisive action by the Government will ensure a banking system which serves the needs of the economy.  That is why the priority of the House should be to immediately move to set up the National Asset Management Agency and deal with the legislation as soon as it is introduced in the House.  The establishment of NAMA will result in a level of write-offs and the principal Irish banks will require further capital injections by the State in the form of ordinary share capital.  The Government has indicated its willingness to meet that need.  It is true the State may become the majority shareholder in such banks.  However, it is important that these banks remain market based, subject to the full rigours of the Irish Stock Exchange and open to the eyes of the international markets.The valuation of assets purchased by NAMA from the banks will be critical and should be handled professionally by independent valuers with checks and controls in place.  We all wish to see credit flowing again in the economy such that it is accessible to small, medium and large Irish businesses.  That is not the case at present.  Temporary nationalisation of the banks without addressing the issue of bad property loans or the need to recapitalise the banks will simply not fulfil that function or achieve our shared objective.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I am delighted to contribute to the debate on this Labour Party motion.  Everyone agrees we have major problems in our banking system.  The issue at hand is how to move forward.  Resolving the situation with the banks is fundamentally about getting funds flowing to small businesses and those who seek mortgages.  To date, that has not happened.  The next step we take will be the critical one.  Above all else, we must be conscious that we are spending not our money but taxpayers' money.  I am not certain the Government would be as enthusiastic as it is about NAMA if it was spending its own money.The creation of NAMA involves buying toxic debt.  We have enough land zoned for development to build 1 million residential units, or 50,000 units a year for 20 years.  Some €60 billion of the €90 billion Peter Bacon and the Government have outlined as necessary to deal with the banks relates to land for development, so the bulk of the land that is zoned for residential development, but is as yet undeveloped, is tied up in debt.  The Government is buying something that does not have value.  If it values the asset too highly, it will cost the taxpayer a significant amount of money because there will be major losses, but if its valuation is too low, the banks will have to get funding from the State, so the taxpayer faces double jeopardy.  Either way, the situation will cost the taxpayer money.Our amendment proposes that:. . . early nationalisation of the banks increases the risk that, by essentially extending the guarantee that the State will guarantee all liabilities of the banks beyond September 2010, the taxpayer will become fully responsible for the unknown, but potentially massive, banking losses that will materialise over the coming years.The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said the Opposition is not coming forward with proposals, but our amendment includes a reasoned, cogent proposal that the Government should:. . . work with the Regulator to conduct detailed loan by loan stress tests in the covered banks to identify the true potential scale of losses under different scenarios, to present these findings to the Oireachtas within six weeks, and, based on these findings, to carry out negotiations with all providers of capital and long-term funding to the banks on the sharing of these losses and to present the results of these negotiations to the Oireachtas within three months.The matter is so significant that it should be brought back to the Chamber.  We also propose that the Government develop in the meantime "a State-sponsored wholesale bank, funded by the European Central Bank, to provide liquidity to the banks by acquiring good assets from the covered banks and thereby underpinning new business lending and mortgage lending from existing banks".The difference between our position and the Government's is that, unlike the Government, we believe the bondholders should share in the risks and losses.  When the Government nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, the bondholders, in effect, were fully bailed out.  Bonds are being traded on the international markets at prices significantly lower than their value when they were taken out with the banks.  Bondholders should take a share of the loss.  The taxpayer should not take the full burden.The State-sponsored wholesale bank we propose would provide funds to the existing banks.  The banks that deal with the public would go to the State-sponsored wholesale bank looking for funds to provide good loans to small businesses and those who seek mortgages.  The banks would get a return in the form of a management fee for administering the loans.We criticise Peter Bacon's analysis because he considered only two propositions — NAMA and the insurance model.  Other models need to be considered.  Fine Gael's fundamental point is that we want funds to flow to small businesses and those who seek mortgages.  The model the Government proposes will only burden hard-pressed taxpayers with long-term debt they cannot afford.  At present there is huge uncertainty, as the Minister for Finance said, and the situation is not simple.  We could give the banks, say, €50 billion under NAMA, but the Government might have to recapitalise the banks again through ordinary shares.  There is also concern about the levy attached to the banks at the end of the scheme, because if the banks cannot afford it, the cost will fall to the taxpayer.I was elected to represent the people of Limerick but also to be accountable to taxpayers for their money.  The scheme the Government has come up with is academic in orientation.  The French equivalent to NAMA, CDR, which was established in 1995 and kept going until 2007, lost €18 billion of the €28 billion that was contributed, or 65% of the value of the assets it took over.  The history of NAMA-type agencies is not good.We must certainly consider the state of loans within the banks.  A few months ago, when AIB issued its results for 2008, it stated its bad debt write-offs for 2009 would total €2.9 billion to €4 billion.  Today, it stated the total would be €4.3 billion.  Fianna Fáil is taking credit for AIB coming out with that figure.  The three directors of AIB said they were resigning, but I note they are going up for re-election tomorrow.  The Government is providing €3.5 billion of taxpayers' money and has given the bank a State guarantee scheme.  Why is the Government allowing the situation to continue?  The tail is wagging the dog.The Government is losing sight of the fundamental point that we need to get funds flowing to small businesses and those who seek mortgages without burdening the taxpayer with enormous debts.  We could provide €50 billion, but further recapitalisation might be required and we might need to bail out the banks at the end with an income levy.  The Government is telling the international markets it will clean up the banks, yet the markets see that the banks, after the bail-out from NAMA and recapitalisation using taxpayers' money, will still have the contingency of the bank levy hanging over them, so the markets might still be unwilling to provide funds to the banks.Our proposal is simple.  The Government should leave the toxic debts with the banks, set up a wholesale bank, and allow it to access funds through the ECB.  The wholesale bank will give the existing banks funds for good loans to small businesses and those who seek mortgages.  The banks will get a return in the form of a management fee.  As the Minister knows, the lack of access to cash is killing small businesses.  I was a chartered accountant practitioner for many years before I went into politics.  The key feature with small businesses is working capital.  If they do not have working capital, they cannot function, but they will not getting working capital from the banks at present.  In fact, it is the reverse; their overdrafts and loan facilities are being cut and all of their existing facilities are being renegotiated at higher interest rates.  While the Government is considering the NAMA project, which is effectively taking over developer loans, people are asking what measures are being put in place for the small businessman or fixed rate mortgage holder who is under pressure at present.What measures were introduced in the budget?  There was a VAT scheme for second hand cars and a measure in regard to intellectual property but, apart from that, nothing was introduced.  With regard to restructuring loans, why is the Government not considering a guaranteed loans scheme for small businesses?  Why did the Government not set up a fund to deal with small businesses?  Why did it not give a reward or incentive for small businesses to retain employees until the end of the year?  All that would appear to have happened is that small businesses are coming under constant pressure.Dr. Peter Bacon has brought out a report which suggests a structure to effectively take over all the toxic debts from the existing banks while the ordinary taxpayer, including the small business person and ordinary mortgage holder, is picking up the tab.  Business people and mortgage holders are clearly cynical and sceptical, with justification, because all they see is the Government spending large sums of money on debt.  If the Minister seriously considers it will get a return on these toxic debts, he is not living in the real world.  There are debts of €50 billion and these assets have lost value by perhaps 50% or more.  The Minister claims he will get a return when a similar project in France had losses of 65%, or €18 billion out of €28 billion.  If €50 billion is the figure, there could be a loss of €25 billion to the taxpayer.What the Minister fails to take into account is that in borrowing money on the international markets to bail out the banks, the taxpayers will ultimately end up paying higher tax taxes over the years, and they will ask why they are doing so.  The model we suggest will allow time for a proper assessment of the loans for each bank.  The review by the Financial Regulator should be brought back into the Houses of the Oireachtas where we are accountable for taxpayers' money.  That would be done within the next six weeks and negotiations would then be carried out with the providers of capital and long-term funding, in particular the bond holders.  The results should be presented to the Oireachtas within three months.The Minister referred to Anglo Irish Bank, which is not doing business and my understanding is that it has up to €30 billion of non-performing debt.  Yet, the Minister states that nationalisation has worked for Anglo Irish Bank.  It should not have been nationalised because there was no justification for it.  It will cost the taxpayer an unquantifiable sum because we have taken over a bank that has huge non-performing debts.  We put forward a proposition at the time that Anglo Irish Bank should be wound down and should become a debt collection agency in its own right.  It would not have to meet capital ratio requirements internationally and would not put taxpayers' money at risk.  We have effectively nationalised a pig in a poke and it is costing the ordinary taxpayer money.I hope this talk about the Opposition not coming forward with proposals will end.  We are coming forward with practical, straightforward proposals that will work and I hope the Minister will take them on board.  I hope we will get a coherent response from Government which shows it has analysed the proposal and will take it on its merits.The key element of our proposal in terms of getting funds flowing is that the Government would establish a State-sponsored wholesale bank funded by the ECB to provide liquidity to the existing banks by acquiring good assets from the covered banks.  I will explain in layman's terms how it would work.  If the banks have good customers to whom they wish to extend credit, such as people wanting to buy homes, they would sell that asset to the State-sponsored wholesale bank.  The bank itself would retain perhaps a 15% stake but the Government and the State-sponsored wholesale bank would have the majority stake of 85% or more.  The ordinary banks — Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and the other banks — would continue to do business with the customer but, effectively, they would just manage it on behalf of the State-sponsored wholesale bank.  The funds would flow because the moneys would only be given to the State-sponsored wholesale bank on the basis of providing funds to small business.The Government has gone into the banks much deeper than it ever expected to.  How does it allow a situation to continue where three directors of AIB state they will resign and yet they will go forward for reappointment tomorrow?  How has a situation arisen where there is not full control over the appointment of a CEO of AIB?  That CEO should come before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in terms of his or her credentials because, ultimately, the banks will get €3.5 billion of taxpayers' money in addition to the guarantees in operation up to 2010.NAMA is an unfair burden on the taxpayer.  It is ill thought out and we still do not know how the assets will be valued.  If the Government was to bring back Deputy John McGuinness or any business person to examine what the Government is proposing, they would not touch it with a 40-foot pole because it is not good value for the taxpayer and it does not deal with the basic requirements of recapitalisation.  What is the function of the banks from a State perspective?  The function of a bank from our perspective as representatives of the people is that it should provide funds to the economy to enable it to function, and working capital to enable small business to flourish and allow first-time buyers and people moving house to access finance.What is happening here is that the Government is putting the banks and the developers first and the taxpayer last.  That cannot continue.  Will the Minister take good Opposition proposals on board?  I hope he will give them due consideration and use them.  We are all seeking to deal with the banking crisis in the national interest.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The people of Ballinamore and south Leitrim have been waiting for many years for the Ballinamore community hospital.  I was informed in a letter from the local health manager on 24 July 2007 that a document had been forwarded to the HSE national headquarters seeking approval to proceed with the next stage, which would provide for the appointment of a design team that would undertake the design, seek planning approval and procure contractors to build the hospital.As the Minister of State knows, the facilities at the proposed development will include a primary care centre that will facilitate the provision of services by general practitioners, public health nurses, physiotherapists and other members of multidisciplinary teams.  A community nursing unit comprising 21 beds and a day service centre will also be incorporated into the design of the nursing unit.  The current cost estimate for the project is €7.29 million.  I welcome the appointment of the design team.  However, I would be grateful for information on when this much-needed development will be built and open to the public.  The HSE and the Government talk about the need for primary care.  I would, therefore, welcome a favourable reply on this matter tonight.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to developing community-based services at local level.Government policy with regard to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the current partnership agreement Towards 2016.  The Government's objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  Since 2006, over €500 million additional funding has been invested in long-term care supports for older people.  This includes the biggest ever investment, over €200 million, to develop community care services.As the Deputy is aware, the Health Act 2004 provides the Health Service Executive with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As a corporate body, the provision of these services, including progressing community hospitals at local level, is therefore an operational matter for the executive.The proposed capital development for Ballinamore, which is at design feasibility stage, has a capital requirement in the region of €6 million and an estimated revenue cost of €500,000 per annum.  The facility is due to be completed in 2012.  The HSE has indicated that the design team for the community nursing unit, 20 beds, and primary care centre in Ballinamore was appointed in October 2008.  Significant progress has been made to date.  Stage 2, preliminary design, is complete and it is anticipated that stage 3 will be completed by end of June 09, which will enable an application for planning permission.  Construction will require further approval to be included in the 2010 NDP plan.  It is anticipated a 12-month construction period would deliver the project, if approved to proceed.The project will provide a community nursing unit of 20 beds on the HSE campus in Ballinamore, as well as a primary care centre.  I understand from the HSE that, when complete, the development will include the following: Ballinamore community hospital — to include long-stay care services and palliative care services; day care services, to include a social model of care with interaction activities and personal care needs; and a centre to facilitate the provision of multidisciplinary primary care services which will ultimately encompass the core multidisciplinary team of general practitioners, public health nurses, mental health, occupational therapy, social work, chiropody, community welfare, physiotherapy, dietetic and home help services.  The key objective in primary care policy is to develop services in the community which will give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams such as that proposed for the Ballinamore development.The HSE has indicated that it aims to have 530 primary care teams developed by 2011.  This target will allow the entire population to easily access a broad range of health and personal social services through their local primary care team.  Some 110 teams are currently in place, with a further 100 planned by year end.  Approximately 200 new primary care centres are currently under consideration following the initiation of a programme to procure centres, which involves the HSE entering into fixed-term lease agreements with private providers.  This infrastructure programme aims to have all sites identified by the middle of this year, with the first group of 80 to open by the end of 2010 and the full complement to open in the course of 2011.  It is planned to have nine centres opened by the end of 2009.The new high quality facility planned for Ballinamore will complement the significant service delivery thresholds that the Government already has put in place or planned for primary care and for services for older people.  However, in light of the current financial difficulties generally, it will be a matter for the HSE to progress this particular project in its priorities under its overall capital programme.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	274	It is with deep regret that I must raise this issue before the House.  I raised the same issue on 1 July last year.  The issue concerns disabled people, the most vulnerable in society.  There is a lack of funding generally from the Government for the disabled.  In my constituency of Limerick East, the Daughters of Charity in St. Vincent's do fantastic work for the intellectually disabled children in schools and provide residential units and training.  The issue I am raising concerns six young adult school leavers with no place to go as funding is not forthcoming for them.  This would be a bottom line issue for any Government.These six young adults are a concern.  Parents have come to me with their concerns.  Last year two parents came to me and after raising the issue many times, funding was eventually provided.  I do not want to have to go through a repeat of that this year.  I want the Government to give a commitment that funding will be provided for these intellectually disabled young adults whose families, parents and friends want to ensure they reach their full potential.  The only way they can do that is if they are given the opportunity to do so within a training setting after they finish school.  In that way they could have a decent life with fair expectations.I should not have to raise this issue on the floor of the Dáil.  We all know from our dealings with parents of intellectually disabled children of the work involved in caring for those children and of the concerns these parents have for their children's future when they themselves will pass away.  Who will look after their intellectually disabled children?  These children who are now leaving school should be able to enter a training environment and have adult day places available to them, yet I must beg here for funding for them.  They should not have to be put in this position.  The funding should be provided.I want the Minister of State to inform me that the funding for six adult day places for these six school leavers leaving St. Vincent's, Lisnagry, will be provided.  I will continue to raise the issue until funding is provided.  I seek a positive response.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the issues raised by Deputy O'Donnell.As Deputy O'Donnell is aware, a range of training, health and personal social day services are provided by several State agencies, including the HSE, non-statutory agencies funded by the HSE, and specialist training providers funded by and on behalf of FÁS, to young people with disabilities when they leave school.  A national review of all health service-funded day services for people with disabilities is being completed.  This review indicates that a total of 25,302 people with intellectual disabilities, physical and sensory disabilities, and-or long-term mental health difficulties attend day services, including training services, either provided by the HSE or provided by non-statutory agencies funded by the HSE.It is important that training services are matched to the person's need.  In meeting this need the HSE employs guidance officers at local level to assist in the profiling of young school leavers with disabilities to appropriate training and day services.  The guidance officers work with the school leaver, their family, school authorities and service providers to ensure that school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.The coordination and planning of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities form a central tenet of the national disability strategy.  A critical element of such coordination and planning is the requirement to provide financial support for the development and implementation of services.  In recent years, the Government has provided significant additional resources for services and supports for effecting real change in the development of services for people with disabilities.  The multi-annual investment programme, which was a key component of the Government's disability strategy, had by the end of the period 2005-08 provided the following places for people with intellectual disability: 804 new residential places, 307 new respite places, and 1,863 new day places, and for people with physical and sensory disabilities, 275 new residential places and 911,626 extra home care-personal assistance hours.In addition, in the same period, the services in 195 day places have been enhanced by the provision of additional supports to deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities; 406 places in the residential service for people with intellectual disability have been enhanced, 61 respite places have been enhanced while 43 residential places in the physical and sensory disability services have been enhanced.Due to the current economic situation, it has not been possible to provide development funding for additional services in 2009.  The HSE and voluntary disability service providers, however, are working together to ensure that of the existing resources available for specialist disability, services are used in the most effective manner possible.  In the current challenging economic environment, there is a responsibility on all publicly-funded services to review the way in which services are delivered and ensure resources are used to maximum effect.  This also applies to disability service providers in the non-statutory sector.The aim should be to ensure that the needs of as many individuals as possible are catered for within the resources available.  Voluntary agencies within the disability sector are working with the HSE to ensure plans are in place in each area to respond to the needs of individuals with disabilities in 2009.  While this will be challenging in the absence of significant funding for new developments, the voluntary sector and HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present.On the specific issue of availability of day places, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE are aware of the particular needs of school leavers in September 2009.  The HSE is reviewing, with service providers, whether capacity exists within current day services to accommodate the needs of some of the individuals in question.  Some funding may be available in the HSE's service plan to provide additional capacity in the event that existing services are not in a position to accommodate an individual's service requirements.  This will be examined on a local and regional level.I understand from the HSE that in the specific cases of the six young adults raised by Deputy O'Donnell, this need has been identified, assessments have been completed and that the HSE will shortly commence the process of engaging with the families with a view to providing this service.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. We are out and about among the people at the moment and a half dozen young people approached me because they are very upset that their time with the Reserve Defence Force has been terminated.  They believe that up to 1,200 people are similarly affected.  I did not know that there were 1,200 people in the Reserve Defence Force but they advise me that the figure could be that high.  These young people were very much enjoying the experience of working with the Defence Forces, having been accepted as reservists.I do not know the scale of the impact on the Reserve Defence Force of the Government moratorium that took effect on 27 March 2009.  Nor do I know if the number affected is that large but it is a most unfortunate and socially undesirable cut.  These are young people, many of whom are unemployed, who regard their time in the Reserve Defence Force as being productive, useful and enjoyable.  For many it gives a purpose in life when they have little prospect of employment.  They believe that they acquire valuable skills and socially the experience is very worthwhile.The policy seems to be penny wise and pound foolish.  Reservists in the Defence Forces are not paid a wage or salary.  Only recently I heard the Minister for Defence boast of increased investment in the reserve with new equipment, clothing and opportunities for improved training.  He even claimed that plans were well advanced to send members of the reserve overseas.The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Áine Brady is responding to this matter and I wish her every success and enjoyment in her role but I hope she is able to tell me what are the statistics in the reserve, how many of these young people are affected as the half dozen who approached me, and how much will be saved as a result of this decision.  In the present climate, with the worst unemployment in the history of the State, I plead with the Minister for Defence to reverse his decision.  These young people are not public service employees.  The cost of their serving in the Reserve Defence Force is minimal and is money well spent.  We should be creating opportunities for these young people and designing programmes to keep them occupied while awaiting employment opportunities.  For some young people the Reserve Defence Force serves that purpose for very little investment.  For those young people who do not proceed with a career in the Defence Forces it is still worthwhile to serve time with the reserve.  I hope the Minister will change his mind.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for his kind good wishes.  The Minister for Defence has asked me to convey his regrets to the Deputy for not being available to respond to this matter on the Adjournment in person tonight but he is grateful to the Deputy for giving him this opportunity to clarify the position regarding recruitment to the reserve.The Reserve Defence Force has undergone significant transformation over recent years on foot of the roll-out of the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan.  The intention was to significantly improve Reserve Defence Force capabilities and enhance interoperability with the Permanent Defence Force.  The reserve has been re-organised along lines similar to the Permanent Defence Force with a three brigade structure and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve.  These revised organisational structures were brought into effect in October 2005.  Further progress has been made in implementing the plan over recent years with increased investment in equipment, clothing and the training of the reserve.All of the actions taken in implementing the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan were identified as being important motivators to recruitment and retention of members of the reserve.  In addition, significant increases to the rate of gratuities paid to members of the reserve were introduced to improve retention and the uptake of training.  Notwithstanding these improvements, membership of the Defence Forces Reserve has declined in recent years.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the public service, with effect from 27 March 2009.  As with the public service generally, the defence organisation is required to operate with reduced funding for 2009.  In this context, all recruitment to the Defence Forces Reserve has been suspended for the present.The current budgetary position requires difficult decisions.  The Minister for Defence's primary goal is to consolidate the significant advances that have been made in developing the Defence Forces Reserve over recent years.  He is anxious to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the current members of the reserve who have devoted significant amounts of their spare time to the organisation in recent years, are afforded the opportunity to maintain their skills.  In this context, members of the reserve undertake both paid and unpaid training.  In 2008 members of the reserve availed of approximately 81,000 paid man days.  The reduced budgetary position this year will allow for approximately 60,000 paid man days.

The military authorities conduct a familiarisation course for applicants pending their successfully satisfying medical requirements and while they are awaiting security clearance.  The suspension of recruitment applies to these persons and not to persons who have already been attested as members of the Defence Forces Reserve.  The Minister for Defence is aware that this is disappointing to those applicants who were hoping to join the reserve.Membership of the Defence Forces Reserve has provided a character-forming opportunity for young persons throughout the country.  The trend in  recent years has shown a decline in membership of the reserve but the changed economic environment could halt this trend.  Those who have participated have developed skills that are beneficial to the Defence Forces, their personal lives, their careers and broader society.  It is important to ensure that the Defence Forces Reserve remain an attractive and challenging option when recruitment recommences.  To this end, the suspension of recruitment is being closely monitored along with the efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the reserve within the more restrictive budgetary provision.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 91 and 115 together.The Government is giving very high priority to supporting the development of Ireland's ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland's renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.  The ocean energy package launched last year is designed to ensure Ireland is fully positioned to harness the rich potential of the technology.  Delivery will entail close cooperation between Departments, Agencies and the Industry to deliver on the roadmap, which will transform ocean energy into a commercially viable industry.The dedicated Ocean Energy Development Unit (OEDU) was established within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) last year.  It has since commenced full implementation of the ocean energy programme.  Expenditure in 2008 was €1 million.  The budget for ocean energy developments for 2009, which is the Unit's first full year in operation, is €7m.  It is anticipated that the budget will be fully spent in 2009.Ocean energy technologies are still in the research and development phase globally.  It is estimated that there are about 10 megawatts (MWs) of ocean energy test projects installed at this time.  This reflects the early phase of development of the technology within international research programmes.  The Government's target, following suitable technology development, is to install 500 MWs of ocean energy technologies by 2020.  We have also sent a clear signal to the market in the announcement of a feed-in tariff of €220 per megawatt hour for wave and tidal technologies under the REFIT Scheme.The ocean energy strategy has already made significant initial progress.  The Unit is open for business and is working with all players in rolling out the key elements of the ocean energy strategy.There are already significant expressions of interest by a range of commercial players who wish to conduct R & D into Ireland's ocean energy potential, at the earliest opportunity.  Attracting and retaining world class renewable energy companies to Ireland is key to the successful development of the ocean energy resource.  The economic potential is estimated to be significant by the IDA.I am working closely with my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that both the short term and medium term offshore energy licensing and planning issues are satisfactorily addressed.  Clarity and certainty about the licensing regime is critical for industry confidence and to secure their long term commitment to Ireland.The Ocean Energy Unit launched the industry prototype development fund towards the end of 2008.  To date, 20 Expressions of Interest leading to seven firm proposals have been submitted by developers.  Of these seven firm proposals for funding three projects are well advanced in the assessment process and the other four proposals are completing technical and business evaluation.  Funding decisions will be made in light of these evaluations.SEI, in partnership with the Marine Institute and ESBI, has undertaken a detailed assessment process since 2007 to identify the most suitable wave energy test site with a grid connection to the electricity network.  The development partnership will now develop a grid connected site off Annagh, County Mayo.  This facility will test operational pre-commercial wave energy devices directly connected to the electricity network.The Project team is completing detailed technical consultation with prospective industrial users of the facility.  It is also completing engineering specifications, onshore and offshore lease applications, network connection and necessary on-shore works.  The project is scheduled to be complete by 2010 subject to external factors including offshore sea conditions during the development phase.The Unit is also working with UCC to upgrade the existing wave-basin located at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC) at UCC.  The facility provides research and testing facilities for a variety of offshore purposes.  The upgrade of the existing facility includes new wave generating equipment, new experimental test rigs, improved workshop facilities and advanced computer solutions for numerical analysis and modelling. Expenditure in 2009 on the facility is estimated at €1 million.In addition, proposals for a new National Ocean Test Facility (NOTF) will be developed by 2012 as part of a proposed Maritime and Energy Research Centre beside the National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy.I am committed to ensuring that we maintain momentum on all fronts.  The work now underway will reap rich dividends for Ireland if we succeed in building the critical mass of knowledge skills and capability to test and develop the technology and systematically address the short to medium term challenges.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 88 and 116 together.The Programme for Government commits to the sustainable development of an Irish biofuels market in line with overall EU biofuel policy developments.  Transport is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and biofuels offer one potential means to counter rising emissions levels in the sector.  I am working with my ministerial colleagues to progressively introduce biofuels into appropriate State fleets.The Government Programme also commits to the introduction of a Biofuels Obligation which will underpin delivery of the national biofuel targets and which will take account of EU developments. The introduction of a Biofuel Obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The biofuels obligation will provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a biofuels sector and delivery of biofuels targets to 2020.  It will also enable market players to make appropriate investment decisions.In light of the public consultation conducted last year my Department is finalising the details of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future with a view to finalising and publishing legislation later in the year.  It is my intention to introduce the Biofuel Obligation Scheme in 2010.The Biofuels Obligation Scheme will provide for trading of certificates between suppliers.  This will benefit those producers of high blend biofuels as they will have surplus certificates to trade with those suppliers bringing lower blends to the market.  Biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps as a result of the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes introduced by my Department. E85 is also available at a number of service stations around the country.  This is in addition to higher blends of Pure Plant Oil which are also available to the retail and commercial sectors.By taking full account of the EU sustainability criteria, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme mechanism will have safeguards so that biofuels are sustainably sourced.  It is expected that evolving second generation technologies will enable increased penetration rates without negative impacts on food prices.  Given that biofuels will form an increasingly important component of European transport fuels, we have worked in Europe to ensure that the sustainability criteria are robust, effective and verifiable. Sustainability criteria are also the key to ensuring investment in more efficient biofuel production, and for investment in second generation biofuels.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 70, 77, 78 and 81 together.The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007 puts in place a flexible framework for the licensing of digital terrestrial television (DTT) into the future.  Under the Act, RTÉ, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) and the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) have obligations to provide for the rollout of DTT and to assist in the development of a plan for analogue switch off.The Act requires that RTÉ operate a single public service multiplex which provides access to the free to air Irish TV channels and that the BCI offers licences for three commercial multiplexes.The development of a national DTT network is important to Ireland, both in terms of securing the future of public service broadcasting and in terms of the potential for benefits to be accrued from the use of the digital dividend which arises from the closure of the analogue television network.A considerable part of the DTT network has already been built by RTÉ.  This build represents the most difficult and costly part of the build plan as it includes the main transmitter sites in Ireland.  In order to develop a viable and reliable national DTT service, additional build work will be necessary.  In particular, the country's minor transmitter sites will need to be upgraded. This will provide "infill" coverage to ensure that the DTT service is reliable and to ensure that outlying areas in the West, North, North West and South of the country, those areas most reliant on the analogue terrestrial service are also served by DTT.The 2007 Act also provides for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) to licence commercial DTT operators.The BCI has run a competition for the award of the three national commercial DTT multiplexes.  On 21 July 2008 the BCI announced its intention to enter into contract negotiations with Boxer DTT Ltd for the award of the three national commercial DTT multiplexes.On the 20 April 2009 the BCI announced that Boxer DTT Ltd had withdrawn from contract negotiations.The BCI subsequently approached the second placed consortium, One Vision.  The BCI has announced that it has now agreed to enter into contract negotiations with One Vision.  I welcome this development and look forward to a speedy and successful conclusion to these negotiations.The BCI have confirmed that they are committed to pursuing the development of DTT services in Ireland as quickly as possible.   I should emphasise that the BCI is an independent body and that I have no role in their licensing process.  I am, however, closely monitoring the progress being made.The switch off of the national analogue broadcasting system is planned to take place by 2012.  A working group has been established — comprising representatives from my Department, RTÉ, BCI and ComReg — to develop a plan for analogue switch-off.ComReg is working closely with its UK counterpart to ensure the continued protection of analogue TV in Ireland.  The UK has a schedule to switch off analogue TV in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of digital terrestrial television.  Analogue services in Wales are set to switch off in autumn 2009.  This is likely to impact viewers along the South East of the country who currently receive overspill of the UK analogue terrestrial television channels.  Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected by these changes.Both RTÉ and the BCI are aware of the situation in Wales and of the importance of providing DTT along the South East of Ireland.In the context of the transition from analogue to DTT, I have also published a paper on the development of a policy framework for identifying the spectrum required for television broadcasting in the UHF band as well as identifying the spectrum that could be released for use by other services.The policy framework requires ComReg to take appropriate actions, in conjunction with the BCI and RTÉ, to identify what spectrum can be made available for the Digital Dividend and to advise me accordingly in a timely manner on what uses could be made of spectrum not required for broadcasting in the band in order for me to make an informed assessment of the policy options for promoting various objectives.To date approximately 19 EU Member States have switched on DTT services and 24 Member States plan to switch off analogue by 2012.  I remain committed to meeting the 2012 deadline for analogue switch off.

It is not directly accountable to any Government Department or State Body.  Details of its running costs are contained in its annual report which is available on its website at www.regtel.ie.Following a review of the regulation of PRS I decided that this function should be carried out directly by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  I initiated the review following:complaints from the public concerning PRS, particularly subscription services aimed at children;RegTel's lack of effective enforcement powers; andthe recognition that the statutory basis for the regulation of PRS required strengthening.Drafting of a Bill entitled ‘Communications Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2009' for the purpose of transferring the regulation of PRS to ComReg is currently being finalised.  I expect to submit the draft Bill to Government for approval to publish within the next few weeks and have it enacted as soon as possible thereafter.  I believe that the Bill will lead to improved protection for consumers and will enhance confidence in the sector.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	285	In July 2008 I published a draft paper on next generation broadband which considered the challenges for the Government in positioning Ireland as a leading country in the provision of broadband infrastructure and in the development of new digital applications.The Paper set out that private sector investment and competition will be the main drivers of the roll out of next generation networks and applications.The Government's role will be to provide a regulatory framework that supports a competitive market and supports potentially risky investments in Next Generation Access Networks.  Provided that principles such as open access and non discrimination are respected, new models of collaboration by operators can be considered.Government will have a direct investment role to play in bridging digital divides where the market cannot provide solutions.Following publication of the draft paper, I initiated an extensive consultation process.  This involved written submissions on the Paper, a one-day Forum held on the 30th September 2008 and an online consultation forum.  The consultation process yielded a wide range of submissions from the industry, policy makers and broadband users.  I am pleased to say that the thrust of the proposals in the draft paper was widely supported.The output of the consultation process informed consideration of the final shape of the policy paper, particularly the implementation of the policy actions such as a one-stop-shop for State infrastructure to facilitate the rollout of fibre to the regions; mandating fibre to new build where practicable; high speed connectivity to schools, and innovative use of frequency spectrum.  I expect to publish the final paper within a matter of weeks.It is also important to note that both public and private investment in telecommunications investment has continued over the period in a manner equally consistent with the thrust of the draft NGN paper.  The private sector investment has seen broadband connectivity exceeding the one million subscriber mark and Ireland is now the fastest growing broadband market in Europe.  Public sector investment has seen the agreement and initial roll-out of the National Broadband Scheme, improvement in International Connectivity through Project Kelvin and the substantial completion of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 74 and 109 together.I welcome the decision taken by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to reduce electricity tariffs by 10% and gas tariffs by 12% from May 1st, following completion of the review of regulated tariffs, which I requested in February last.  The Commission's decision on electricity tariffs is reflective of the decline in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of exponential increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.The CER's pricing decision on gas tariffs is due to the much lower gas costs than forecast, exchange rate developments, and particularly as a result of increased sales during the winter due to the particularly cold weather.The reduction in regulated energy prices is less than the overall fall in fuel commodities, because the CER took steps to ensure that when international oil and gas prices increased exponentially in 2008, consumers were insulated from the worst effects of these increases.In taking this approach, the CER took account of the emerging difficult economic situation and the potential impact of high price increases on business and consumers, including vulnerable customers.  This approach meant that when fossil fuels were rising very significantly in early and mid-2008 the CER decided to implement an increase of 17.5% in the cost of electricity and 20% in the cost of gas.  When the CER made this decision, the wholesale gas price had more than doubled in the previous 12 months.I would point out again that the CER has exited from the regulation of tariffs for large energy users.  In that sector around 90% of business has switched to the independent electricity suppliers.  Approximately half of these large commercial customers are on variable tariffs.  As a result the substantial reductions in wholesale electricity and gas prices are already being reflected in their tariffs.It is the case that energy costs have been of concern to enterprise for a number of years.  This concern has been exacerbated by the economic downturn and the overall serious challenges facing business.  I have made it consistently clear that all possible action that can be taken must be taken to reduce energy costs for the enterprise sector.  Energy policy actions are focussed on mitigating those costs where possible.My Department is actively engaged on the energy costs issue with all relevant players, including the CER, ESB, the independent suppliers and the enterprise sector itself.I have no direct role in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated sector.  My policy objective is to secure sustainable and diverse energy supply at least cost for Irish business and consumers.  The Government's comprehensive range of energy policy actions are designed to deliver this objective.  They include optimising all possible energy efficiency gains by industry and by householders.The Government's strategies for renewable energy development, energy efficiency programmes and delivering essential strategic energy infrastructure are all key to delivering sustainable competitive and reliable energy supplies.Energy efficiency is the best energy resource of all, delivering pervasive benefits for the economy and society.  The energy efficiency potential in the built environment, in industry, in power generation and in transport is growing all the time as technology and innovation delivers more solutions.I launched the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan last week, which sets out the comprehensive actions underway and which will reduce costs for all.

The Government is fully committed to the cost effective delivery of the interconnector as a key strategic energy infrastructure project.  The benefits for the economy, the energy market and consumers include:Enhancing security of energy supply by delivering additional capacity to the all-island electricity market and linking it to the UK, which is in turn connected to mainland European markets;Underpinning delivery of Ireland's renewable generation targets by providing additional back-up at times of low wind and enabling the export of wind energy from Ireland at times of high wind generation;Supporting further competition in the electricity market and exerting downward pressure on prices;Diversifying the national fuel mix and supply sources by reducing our dependence on electricity generated from imported natural gas; andProviding EirGrid, as the system operator, with important back-up and reserve services.The Government has been advised by EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) that, over the lifetime of the project, these benefits will more than outweigh the development costs.In a strong endorsement by the European Union of the project, Ireland has secured €110 million for the East West interconnector under the European Economic Recovery Plan.  This funding will be an important component of the overall financial package.  In making cost comparisons it should be borne in mind that each electricity interconnector project is a unique development.  Interconnectors across Europe and around the world vary in terms of capacity, length, diversity of terrain and the proportion of the project that is sub-sea or on-land.I can advise the Deputy that the contract for the development of the East West interconnector was awarded on foot of an open, tender process conducted by EirGrid under the regulatory oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Both EirGrid and CER have advised that the contract price negotiated with the successful bidder represents full value for money in a very competitive process.  I am satisfied, on the basis of the comprehensive advice by EirGrid and CER to me and my Department, that the contract is economically advantageous and that EirGrid is on schedule to deliver the East West interconnector by 2012.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 93 together.Applications for grid connections are made to ESB Networks and/or EirGrid, in the first instance.  Data on grid connections has been published by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) as part of its consultation process on grid connections and additional information is published from time to time by EirGrid.There are currently in excess of 1,300 megawatts (MWs) of renewable electricity generating capacity connected to the electricity grid.  The majority of these projects are within the wind-powered category.  More that 1,000MW of that capacity is wind-powered plant with hydro-power contributing approximately 238MW.  The remainder comprises biomass and biogas powered projects.  Based on current technology trends, the dominance of the wind-powered category to date is expected to continue out to 2020 at least.The Government targets are to increase the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity consumed to 15% by 2010 and 40% at least by 2020.Delivery of additional new projects to meet or surpass these targets are well advanced.  Alongside the increase in renewable generation capacity in recent years the renewable electricity share of total electricity usage has increased year on year.  The contribution from renewable resources has increased from 4.4% in 2003 to over 12% in 2008.The 2008 contribution represents over 1,300 Megawatts of renewable powered plants connected to the grid.  The CER and EirGrid have calculated that 5800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity is required to achieve the 40% target in 2020.  The latest figures from EirGrid and the CER show that there is a further 1,500 MW with signed connection agreements or in the final stages of agreeing one.I am satisfied there is sufficient market confidence among developers and investors to deliver or surpass both the 2010 and 2020 targets.The recent CER decision on the ‘Gate 3' round provides for connection offers for 3,900 MW of additional renewable electricity capacity.  The size of the gate 3 round was initially set at 3,000MW of capacity by the CER.  This was increased to 3,900MW of capacity in line with the Government's renewable electricity 2020 target of 40%.  The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  All industry stakeholders were afforded the opportunity of responding to the proposed connection process.The projects in Gate 3 were selected on a "first come first served" criterion.  The projects within the 3900 MW capacity in the Gate 3 process are currently being assessed as part of the connection process.To ensure this process operates efficiently, the CER has established a Gate 3 Liaison Group involving all stakeholders, including the renewable industry associations, to ensure the connection offer process is completed as quickly and as effectively as possible. Once connection offers issue to applicants they will have a set time frame to accept the offer or else they will forfeit the connection offer.  The Gate 3 process will be supplemented by further measures to support future autogeneration and ocean energy connections.The decision by CER on Gate 3 is potentially capable of delivering the 40% national target for the contribution from renewable energy resources to electricity consumed by 2020.  It is the case however that CER and EirGrid need to review and develop with my Department and the industry an appropriate and effective approach to accommodating further renewable energy developments including autogeneration projects by enterprise as well as offshore wind and ocean energy projects.

The overarching allocation of Radio spectrum is undertaken in an international context and in accordance with international regulations.The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), is the statutory body responsible for spectrum management in Ireland and is statutorily obliged under the Communications Act 2002, to produce, publish and maintain the national Radio Frequency Plan, which is a national table of frequency allocations.  This document details International and European frequency allocations as well as national usage and relevant national and European legislation. Copies of this document can be obtained from ComReg (www.comreg.ie).As Minister with overall responsibility for spectrum policy, I am committed to ensuring that the spectrum resource is assigned and used effectively.  This involves the efficient use of spectrum and also involves ensuring that spectrum policy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate technological development and that it supports and promotes innovation, and research and development, in new spectrum based technologies.The Report of a Working Group on Spectrum Policy was published last year by my Department concerning the areas of use, the means of assignment and future trends in spectrum use. This document recognises the importance of a flexible and innovative spectrum policy which might incorporate developing concepts such as open access to spectrum resources and the importance of spectrum for the development and provision of wireless broadband services.  The consultation on this document has now closed and taking cognisance of the responses received a Spectrum Policy will be produced and any necessary legislative changes will be made.

The use and display of telephone numbers is an area in which I have no statutory function.   In relation to the wider public sector,  I will ask my officials to contact the Quality Customer Service Officers Network, which is managed by the Department of the Taoiseach, requesting that they advise Government Departments and State Agencies to display and use both local and lo-call numbers.My own Department uses both a lo-call number and a standard local number to facilitate a choice for members of the public. These numbers are published on the Department's website and in telephone directories.

While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for whatever reason (long lines, pair gains, no line of sight etc) in receiving a broadband service, the National Broadband Scheme cannot cater for such limited instances.  It is expected that over time, competing service providers would be attracted to offer services in such areas, given that those areas are already commercially viable for the existing service provider(s).  It is also expected that technology innovations e.g. improved satellite broadband services, will result in increased competition in the served areas.Details of the availability of broadband services in the specific areas not covered by the NBS are available at www.broadband.gov.ie.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84 and 95 together.Together with the Minister for Transport, I have announced plans for the large scale deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.   A number of initiatives to advance the strategy have already been put in place.An inter-departmental agency Taskforce has been established and is meeting regularly to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland. Chaired by my Department, the Taskforce comprises the Departments of Transport, Finance, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  ESB, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are also key members of the taskforce.The Taskforce is assessing the options and timeframe for creating the necessary infrastructure for the national roll-out of electric vehicles, taking account of global developments.  The Government is sending out the message that Ireland is open for business in this area.  The Taskforce will report its initial findings and advise on next steps shortly.  Three sub groups are operating with the Taskforce: a Transport/Infrastructure Group, a Fiscal Group, and an Enterprise Group.  The reports of these groups will inform the main report being prepared by the Taskforce.  All issues relating to employment opportunities, the costs involved in providing car charging infrastructure and associated issues will be addressed in the report.The ESB and SEI have been working intensively within the Taskforce and visited Israel and Denmark last year to learn from their approaches to fast tracking the deployment of electric vehicles.  SEI is also developing a €1 million project on alternative transport technologies including electric vehicles.The recently concluded Memorandum of Understanding with Renault-Nissan will ensure that Ireland will be one of the first countries in the world to be supplied with both Renault and Nissan electric cars.  This represents a major opportunity for Ireland both in terms of our targets and more generally in relation to the economic impact of electric car development.  Under the Memorandum of Understanding ESB Networks will be able to avail of data on developments in electric vehicles, enabling more detailed and precise planning around infrastructure, support mechanisms and the potential benefits accruing.  My Department is working with ESB to determine how the necessary infrastructure arising from the arrangement will be put in place and how best to fund this infrastructure.The Memorandum of Understanding does not convey exclusive rights in relation to the provision of electric cars.  Ireland is open for business to all manufacturers in relation to electric vehicles and I look forward to building relationships with all global players in the sector.I have read with great interest the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Change relating to electric vehicles which is an important contribution to the work underway.  The recommendations of the Report will be considered as part of the overall strategy for electric vehicles.My Department does not have information available on the number of businesses which have taken up the new tax incentive to purchase electric vehicles.  Decisions in relation to the ministerial car fleet do not come under the direct remit of my Department.

An Post's annual report for 2008 shows that, because of its pension deficit at the end of last year, its net assets were half or less of the amount of the company's called-up share capital.  Arising from this, in accordance with the requirements of Company Law, the company convened an extraordinary general meeting last month for the purpose of considering whether any, and if so what, measures should be taken to deal with the situation.  I was represented at the meeting by officials from my Department.At the EGM the chief executive advised that the company is required to formulate and submit a plan to the Pensions Board for corrective action to meet the Pensions Act Minimum Funding Standard by June 2010 and that, all other things being equal, addressing the minimum funding standard will, in time, eliminate the Balance Sheet deficit.  He also advised that because investment markets are volatile this plan will require continual readjustment.The Chairman undertook to brief, in due course, the company's shareholders on the plan of corrective action to meet the Pensions Act Minimum Funding Standard.  In addition to this, myself and officials at my Department will continue to meet with the An Post management on a regular basis to discuss a range of matters of importance to the company including its finances.

The scheme provides structural energy efficiency improvements to private homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty.  These measures include insulation, boiler lagging jackets, energy efficient lighting and draft proofing measures.To date, energy efficiency improvements in almost 24,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme.  A breakdown by year is set out in the table.  Some €20 million has been provided for the scheme in 2009, which includes €5 million being provided between ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann.  This will enable structural improvements to be made to at least 15,000 homes this year.  To date, nearly 3,000 homes have been upgraded in the first 4 months of this year.Some 21 CBOs have to date been approved by SEI to provide the Warmer Homes Scheme service in their area.  SEI is confident that national coverage under the scheme will be achieved by the end of 2009.  SEI will be publishing a call for proposals this month, inviting new community organisations to participate in the scheme.Each CBO is responsible for managing applications in its own operational areas.  SEI is not directly involved in the application or delivery process.  Once an application is made to a CBO, details are registered and the house is addressed in turn.  I understand that there is a waiting period in some areas and that this can be up to 12 months in some areas.  With the substantially increased funds available to the scheme this year, SEI expects the waiting time to decrease.  This cannot happen overnight, as the CBOs concerned must increase their capacity to deliver through new staff and other resources.The most recent research figures available on fuel poverty in Ireland are contained in a recent working paper by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  There are a variety of ways to measure fuel poverty including the proportion of household expenditure on fuel, the condition of the house and the subjective view of occupants about their energy needs.The ESRI estimates that using the expenditure method, over 300,000 or 19.4% of Irish households may have experienced fuel poverty in 2008.  Alternatively, using the subjective method, over 68,000 or 4.6% of households reported that they could not afford to heat their homes adequately.There are many alternative definitions and measurements of fuel poverty.  The Government's own working definition is the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because the home is not energy efficient.  By assisting vulnerable homes to become energy efficient, the Warmer Homes Scheme is designed to tackle the root causes of fuel poverty.The Fuel Poverty Action Research Project was established by Combat Poverty and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to inform the future directions of energy efficiency programmes for vulnerable households.  The project involved a rigorous assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the Warmer Homes Scheme.  I understand that completion of the report was delayed by the accidental loss of some key interview data.  To ensure the integrity of the analysis, these interviews had to be repeated.  Combat Poverty is currently finalising the report and I am informed that it will be published shortly.YearNumber of Homes20001,43020011,50020021,60020031,76820041,94720051,81320062,10220073,37820085,343Total20,881

Clearly eircom is an important player in private sector provision of telecommunications services and will continue to play a key role in providing higher speed broadband services.  The commercial performance and ownership of the company is a matter for the company in the first instance and I have no direct role in this regard.  Given the importance of eircom to Ireland's communication infrastructure and services, I am monitoring the overall situation in relation to the company but I have no plans to propose State ownership of the company.More generally, Government policy is to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector providers.  In terms of access to broadband, Ireland now has a vibrant broadband market with many service providers offering competitively priced retail services across a range of technology platforms at increasingly fast speeds.In addition, the National Broadband Scheme will bring broadband to those parts of the country where a commercial service cannot be provided.  This will result in broadband being available throughout the country.The soon to be published policy paper on next generation broadband will set out a strategic framework for the evolution to high speed broadband for all players in the sector.

It is expected that the final network will be completed in early 2010.All completed Phase II networks are being managed, maintained and operated on an interim basis by the technical services firm Magnum Opus on behalf of my Department.  Magnum Opus will manage the Phase II MANs until such time as a Management Services Entity is engaged for the Phase II MANs (MSE 2).The procurement process for the engagement of a MSE II is in the final stages of contract negotiations with eNet, the preferred bidder.  Value for money is a key consideration for the Department in the negotiations, which are expected to be concluded in the coming weeks.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 97 together.The rollout of a national Smart Metering Programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.The pilot phase is a very important element in the determination of a decision to proceed with the launch of a national smart metering scheme.  This is a highly complex technological project and the trials are essential to ensure that we have the right technology and systems for the full launch and implementation of a national smart metering scheme.The pilot phase was launched on 15 September 2008.  The results of the pilot will inform both the timing of a national roll out, and the technology to be adopted.  It is important to have a trial that captures seasonal changes in usage for peak demand management purposes.  The pilot phase is expected to be completed at end December 2010 and the outcome should be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter(s)/IT system(s), tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli, all of which works effectively and has the capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering in the Irish market.The pilot phase encompasses two strands: a technology trial, which is testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure and a customer behaviour trial, which will determine the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.The technology trial will examine metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  There are many challenges involved in developing a metering system for Ireland that will reflect the dispersed nature of our population and, as a result, by extension, the electricity network.  This trial will involve the installation of up to 8,000 meters.  Installation of the first 2,000 meters for technology testing is due to commence in May 2009.Participants for the customer behaviour trial are being selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland's electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Invitations to participate in the trial are being issued on a phased basis with 24,000 letters of invitation issued thus far.  The number of participants needed for the electricity customer behaviour trial is 6,000. To date the response has been very positive with sufficient numbers recruited to enable the residential element of the trial to proceed.  Installation of electricity meters for this strand of the pilot phase is almost complete with 5,232 meters installed to date.  All meters for the Customer Behaviour Trial are expected to be installed by end May 2009.  The dispersed nature of our electricity consumers poses a major challenge to ESBN and the pilot is expected to inform the best metering systems to use in an Irish market.The gas element of the Smart Metering Pilot Programme is also being progressed. 1,975 customers are expected to participate in Gas Customer Behaviour Trials.  A further 750 meters will be installed to facilitate the Gas Technology Trials. Customers for the Gas Customer Behaviour Trial are expected to be recruited by end July 2009.  The trial period will begin in June 2010 and is expected to continue until May 2011.I have also announced measures to encourage and enable the on-site generation of electricity in homes and farms across the country.  While the Smart Metering pilot is proceeding in parallel with this microgeneration initiative, there are important links between the two.  The import and export data gathered form this microgeneration initiative will feed into the analysis of Smart Metering being carried out in the pilot.  While the findings of the smart meter pilot will in turn inform the development of a long-term micro generation programme. Eligible installations include small scale wind, photovoltaic, hydro and combined heat and power.The cost of the pilot will be €34.9m comprising €29.9m for the electricity smart metering trials and €5m for the gas element of the smart metering trial.  The cost of a national roll out will be available when the pilot programme has been completed and a fully informed decision made on the type of smart metering system that will deliver the level of functionality required in an Irish market.The Cost Benefit Analysis is scheduled to be completed at end Quarter 1 2011 in respect of the electricity element of the Smart Metering Pilot Programme.  As the electricity smart metering trials are at a more advanced stage than gas trials, an interim gas cost benefit analysis will take place at this stage with the final gas cost benefit analysis expected to be completed by mid 2011 and published as an addendum to the initial results.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	298	In designing the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was approved by the EU Commission, my Department needed to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved premises as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU State Aid rules.The NBS will be rolled out on an electoral division (ED) basis, which are the smallest administrative areas used for statistical purposes in the country.  In adopting the ED model my Department was faced with a further decision to determine which EDs should be addressed by the NBS.  This decision was made based on levels of the existing combined broadband coverage in relevant EDs.  Where an ED is completely unserved by any existing service provider it is included in the NBS.  Where it is substantially covered by existing service providers it is excluded from the NBS.  Where an ED is not substantially covered by existing service providers, it will be addressed by the Scheme.  In this regard EU State Aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas that are already substantially served by broadband.  While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for a variety of reasons in receiving a broadband service, the NBS cannot cater for such limited instances as to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.It is expected that over time, as competition increases, service providers will be attracted to offer service to unserved premises in these areas. It is also expected that technology innovations e.g. improved satellite broadband services, will result in increased competition in these areas.

It provides listeners with more choice, clearer sound and more features, while keeping all the features of FM radio, such as portability and free to use. The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 provides for the development of radio over digital multiplexes by both public service and commercial broadcasters.It provides for RTÉ to be licensed for national multiplex(es) and it also provides for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) to issue national and regional multiplexes to commercial operators.  However, unlike Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT), where there in an imperative to "go digital" at the earliest opportunity, there are no current plans for switching off the analogue radio services.  This means that the rollout of digital radio is likely to occur over a longer time period and in line with commercial and technology considerations.RTÉ has been running a trial of DAB radio over the last 2 years and has now commenced the rollout of a DAB multiplex.  In this regard, RTÉ has developed a number of new radio channels specifically for this multiplex i.e. RTÉ Junior, RTÉ Choice, RTÉ Pulse, RTÉ Gold, RTÉ Chill and RTÉ 2xm.  The present service is available in the greater Dublin area, the North East of the country, Cork City and Limerick City.  Data on digital listening is not yet available to RTÉ.

In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very costly and technologically challenging to reach using standard infrastructure, a limited number of residences and businesses in the NBS coverage area may be covered by a satellite service.The NBS contract defines specific thresholds and circumstances under which satellite can be deployed and allows for a maximum of 8% of buildings to be served utilising satellite technology.  It is anticipated that the actual deployment of satellite will be around 5% of residences and businesses within the NBS coverage area.  It is a matter for the NBS service provider, "3", to decide where a satellite solution will be deployed, provided that the overall number of satellite users does not exceed defined thresholds for each county and the NBS coverage area as a whole.The NBS contract guarantees that the satellite service will deliver minimum speeds of 1 megabit download and 128 kilobits upload with a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, a round-trip latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabyte (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.  Regardless of the technology deployed, the same monthly charge of €19.99 and the same install cost of €49 apply.As a commercial matter, 3 has selected Avanti to provide the guaranteed satellite service levels and I understand that 3 has entered into a contract with Avanti on a non-exclusive basis.

The campaign has been operating since August 2006 and has brought about a significant increase in awareness of energy efficiency and best practice energy behaviour.  Since the beginning of 2009, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has assumed responsibility for the campaign.  My Department has agreed with SEI that their stewardship will see the next phase of the campaign move away from mass media messaging towards more localised behavioural change projects, though the website will continue to be an important information hub.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the Change campaign.  The objective of the campaign is to raise public awareness of climate change, its causes, impacts and implications for Ireland, as well as to drive significant behavioural change to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in how we live, work and travel.  The remit of the campaign covers the broad spectrum of transport, waste, water, energy, biodiversity and planning across the sectors of agriculture, transport, construction, tourism, business, industry and the public sector.  The campaign includes a significant advertising element as well as extensive stakeholder engagement to develop specific programmes and web-based tools tailored to achieve emission reductions at sectoral level.Since the inception of the Change campaign, there has been a high degree of coordination and cooperation between the two campaigns in relation to energy efficiency and carbon reduction.  This has involved sharing of materials, co-funding of projects and many linkages between the websites of the two campaigns.  This approach has led to significant savings for the Exchequer.I believe this cooperative approach should continue.  My Department and SEI are both represented on the inter-Departmental steering committee for the Change campaign.  In respect of Power of One, I have asked SEI to actively pursue the scope for continuing and enhancing cooperation between the campaigns as part of their management of Power of One.

I have no responsibility for setting these tariffs.The CER has a statutory duty to advise me as Minister on the development of the electricity and gas markets, and regular meetings are held on a monthly basis between officials in my Department and the CER.  Electricity and gas tariffs are often an agenda item at these meetings.In February of this year I asked CER to undertake an immediate review of options to bring forward a reduction in electricity prices.  I met the Commissioners on February 12th to discuss this and conveyed my opinion that lower energy costs could be provided to consumers in a non-distortionary fashion through an expedited review of tariffs.I welcome the subsequent decision taken by the CER to lower electricity tariffs by 10% and gas tariffs by 12% from May 1st, following their completion of the expedited review of tariffs.  The Commission's decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of sustained increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.

Energy costs are a major concern for all sectors of the economy.  There is a range of factors which have contributed to Ireland's higher than the EU average increases in electricity prices over recent years. Historical reasons — A long period without any price increases granted to ESB, coupled with rapid growth in electricity demand, resulted in a legacy of under investment in energy infrastructure — both in generation and in networks. Natural Resources and Fuel Mix — Ireland has the highest dependency on fossil fuels in the EU (over 85%).  Only Italy and Netherlands have a comparable level of fossil fuel penetration and they both also have relatively high energy prices. Geographical Isolation — Given our lack of natural resources, fossil fuels required for generation must be imported.  Our isolated geographical position at the periphery of Europe raises the cost of this transportation over and above what is paid by other European countries. Market Scale — Given the small size of our electricity market and lack of interconnection, Irish power generation plants tend to be smaller than those on the continent.  This gives rise to diseconomies of scale relative to Europe, which also contributes to a higher than average cost of electricity. Population Dispersion — Ireland's population demographics are dissimilar from most of our European neighbours.  An extremely wide but low rural population density means that connection costs for rural energy customers have been cross-subsidised by urban dwellers and costs are higher for the maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system.The Government's Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government set out the actions being taken to improve the competitiveness of energy supply.  We must use energy far more efficiently, deliver on our ambitious renewable targets and progress vital strategic energy infrastructure such as the East West Electricity Interconnector.  Initiatives in all these areas are being progressed and substantial progress has been made to date in relation to their delivery.In addition, since the introduction of the All-island Single Electricity Market in 2007, the transformation of the Irish electricity market from an ESB monopoly to a competitive market has considerably accelerated with the involvement of additional players in power generation and supply.  There are now four large independent suppliers, actively competing in the unregulated sector of the energy market, which also put downward pressure on energy costs over the medium to long term.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	306	While the provision of broadband is a matter for the service providers, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage including the Group Broadband Scheme, the Metropolitan Area Networks Programme and the recently announced National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  These initiatives have been designed to bridge the digital divide, create greater equality in terms of social and economic inclusion and remove the disadvantage caused by a lack of broadband services.The NBS will ensure broadband services are available in un-served rural areas by September 2010.  In addition the initiatives facilitate competition in the broadband market in the regions leading to greater choice, quality and value for money to the consumer.I am acutely aware of the importance of measures to facilitate people in learning how to use information age technologies or to acquire or improve digital skills. That is why my Department has put in place the BenefIT eInclusion Grant Scheme.  Through this scheme we are partnering with community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations to making available eInclusion opportunities — with a major focus on digital skills and training.  We have allocated over €2.2m to 87 projects under this scheme.  These projects are currently ongoing and are operating throughout the country — some of them still have training places available.  Details of the specific projects including where they are operating and what they cover are available on my Department's website http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/Knowledge+Society/I am satisfied that my Department has, through the various initiatives, facilitated the widest possible roll-out of broadband connectivity, which has in turn underpinned widespread eInclusion.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The EU Commission's proposals for reform of the electronic communications framework have been the subject of intense negotiation at EU Council and Parliament over the past sixteen months.  As Minister for Communications, I and my officials have fully participated in these negotiations.  I have strongly supported the package of proposals agreed by Council, especially the measures aimed at encouraging competition and investment in next generation networks.The proposals aim to strengthen the regulatory framework and improve the consistency of its implementation throughout the EU.  They provide for greater cooperation on regulatory decisions between the Commission and national regulators through the establishment of a new body, the Board of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).  Functional separation, as an exceptional remedy to be imposed by national regulators, if all other available remedies have failed to overcome competition problems, is also provided for in the revised package.The sector generally will benefit from measures to encourage competition and investment in next generation access networks by reaffirming the importance of competition in this area while ensuring that telecom operators receive a fair return on their investments.  Also, the rules governing the sharing of network elements, such as ducts and in-building wiring, between operators are updated.  Besides improving competition and services for businesses and consumers, this will also help to lower costs for operators and improve the investment climate for high speed broadband services.The revised package also contains measures providing greater flexibility in the management and use of the radio spectrum.  These will allow operators to introduce innovative services and technologies in spectrum bands that are currently assigned for specific uses, while at the same time protecting rights of use for emergency and security services and for meeting general interest objectives such as public sector broadcasting.Overall, I believe that the revised regulatory framework, when implemented, will have a beneficial impact on the Irish telecommunications sector and on consumers.  It will lead to better and more effective regulation of the market and will provide greater regulatory certainty to operators.

Applications to the scheme may be submitted to BCI by radio or television broadcasters and by independent production companies.  The Broadcasting Fund is funded from the allocation of 5% of the net television licence fee receipts and the allocation in the 2009 Estimate is €10.8m.  The Deputy may wish to note that in the context of the Broadcasting Bill I am proposing to increase the allocation to the fund from the existing 5% of net licence fee receipts to 7%.

Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has put in place a requirement that applicants to the scheme install measures attracting a minimum grant payment of €500.  The administrative cost for SEI of processing grants under the Home Energy Saving Scheme is relatively fixed, regardless of the amount of the grant payment concerned.  SEI has worked to keep administrative costs of the Scheme to a minimum.The administrative cost of disbursing grants for relatively low cost measures such as attic insulation or cavity wall insulation would be unacceptably high if these were permitted on their own.  It is likely that many householders would return to the scheme at a later date seeking support for other measures, giving rise to multiple administrative charges on the scheme.  The minimum grant threshold serves to ensure value for money to the Exchequer, while encouraging homeowners to take a holistic approach from the outset to improving the energy efficiency of their homes.In regard to those on low incomes, it is the case that €20 million has been provided to the Warmer Homes Scheme for 2009, a very substantial increase on previous years.  The Warmer Homes Scheme is specifically targeted at low income households.  This scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) at little or no cost to the homeowner.The Warmer Homes Scheme is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in this year alone.  Further information on the Warmer Homes Scheme is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at www.sei.ie/Grants/Warmer Homes Scheme.The third strand of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery involves the retrofitting of insulation and other measures to improve the energy efficiency in local authority housing stock.  I understand that proposals for the implementation of this element of the programme are at an advanced stage of development and an announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is expected shortly.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	310	In July 2008 I published a consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband.  One of the proposals in this paper is to establish a one-stop-shop to provide electronic communications service providers with flexible and open access to existing and future State ducting infrastructure to facilitate the provision of backhaul.  The proposal for a one-stop-shop received a largely positive response in the consultation process.My officials have conducted work on identifying the supply of relevant State-owned infrastructure and are working with the relevant State agencies, mainly in the energy and transport sectors to examine how best their assets can be accessed and utilised.Telecoms operators and service providers are the potential customers of a one-stop-shop and my Department is now engaging with them on how best to progress the one-stop-shop initiative.A number of issues, relating to the agencies and to the operators and service providers, have been identified including commercial and legal issues, and operational issues such as ensuring safety when accessing infrastructure assets.  These are complex matters that need careful consideration as we develop an appropriate model for the one-stop-shop.  My Department and the agencies are committed to working out how best such issues can be addressed and ensuring that the ducting assets that are in State ownership are used to the greatest possible extent in our evolving Next Generation Broadband network.

The scheme has evolved over that period, supported by appropriate budgetary allocations year on year.  Phase III was launched in July 2008 and continues to support the installation of a variety of technologies in existing homes.To date, Sustainable Energy Ireland has paid out over €55m to almost 21,000 successful applicants. The current level of accepted offers, including the €55.5m paid to date, is €64.5m.  The 2009 allocation is €12.345m, which will be sufficient to meet demand over the course of the year.

While such other systems may have advantages, I have not yet formed any conclusive opinions of which new method, if any, would be appropriate for this country.In relation to the imprisonment of persons, I have introduced two new provisions in the Broadcasting Bill 2008, which I anticipate will reduce the necessity for criminal proceedings in respect of the non-payment of the television licence fee.The first provision in section 149 of the Bill proposes an on-the-spot fine mechanism to be deployed at the option of the television licence collection agent.  In essence this mechanism provides that if a person buys a television licence within a set time period and pays a penalty equivalent to one-third of the annual television licence fee, then no court proceedings will be taken, thus reducing the necessity for court proceedings.The second provision which is proposed in section 150(3) empowers the television licence collection agent to pursue as a civil debt an amount owing in respect of a television licence fee.

The plan is a further comprehensive development of the Government's energy efficiency strategies as set out in the first Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which was published and submitted to the European Commission in October 2007.  The new plan has been informed by the public consultation process conducted last year as well as energy efficiency policy developments since 2007.  The Plan also takes account of the current economic climate which underlines the imperative to significantly enhance energy savings and to optimise jobs and economic activity in the energy services sector.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 377 and 378 together.The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes were introduced in 2005 and 2006 on the basis of competitive calls for proposals.  The scoring mechanism was published as part of the application form and accompanying documentation. There were specific limits on the amount of excise relief available under the various categories in each scheme and this was also stipulated in the relevant Guidance Notes.   Assessment panels were established to review the applications received for both schemes and officials from my Department participated in the assessment process.My Department made recommendations to the Minister for Finance in relation to those biofuels projects to be approved for excise relief. In all instances applicants were not awarded the full amount of MOT relief sought.The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  Of these projects, four are in the biodiesel category, five are in the pure plant oil category, four are in the bioethanol category and five are in the captive fleets category.While individual amounts of biofuel produced by particular companies under the schemes is considered to be commercially sensitive information, I can advise the Deputy that under Scheme I excise relief was awarded on 16m litres of biofuel with over 6.8 m litres of biofuel being produced. Under Scheme II excise relief was awarded on 665m litres of biofuel and up to the end of December 2008 there has been over 108.2 m litres of biofuel produced.  My Department does not have details of the number of companies who were not successful in being awarded excise relief under the schemes but who are currently producing biofuel.The schemes were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of biofuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of a biofuels obligation in 2010.Since the excise relief schemes were introduced there has been a steady increase in biofuels used in Ireland, albeit from a very low base. Prior to the introduction of the schemes, market penetration of biofuels was almost non existent.  In 2007, penetration had risen to 0.6% and on the basis of the MOTR figures alone, penetration had risen to 1.5% in 2008.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the position of individual companies within the schemes or on their business practices.  There have been at least five biofuels plants constructed or redeveloped on foot of excise relief granted under the schemes.  A number of others are either at an advanced stage of planning, or have received planning permission.  All but two of the projects are currently availing of the excise relief and my Department liaises with all project promoters on a regular basis.The European biofuels industry generally, has experienced profound difficulties over recent years.  A prolonged period of price volatility culminated in a severe decline in mineral prices fundamentally affecting the competitiveness of biofuels. In addition, the availability of US subsidised biodiesel, known as "B99", also placed considerable commercial pressure on the European and Irish industry.  This has been redressed by the countervailing action taken by the EU Commission last month.It is highly likely that some of the biofuels exported from Ireland do re-enter the country in a blended state.  This is a function of the fact that biofuels and the products used to make them are internationally traded commodities.The introduction of the Biofuels Obligation in 2010 will provide the Irish biofuels sector with the certainty it needs to invest and grow in a sustainable way.

I would, however, expect to receive the recommendations of the Geothermal Working Group in the next few weeks when it is intended to publish the results of these deliberations on the Department's website.  I will then decide on the need for legislation and an appropriate regulatory framework.While there are broad similarities between geothermal energy and minerals in terms of development requirements, work is continuing on a separate footing to finalise a draft of the proposed Minerals Development Bill, which is expected to be published after the summer recess 2009.

Section 25 deals in detail with the matter of safety representation. A safety representative may consult with, and make representations to, the employer on safety, health and welfare matters relating to the employees in the place of work. The employer must consider these representations, and act on them if necessary.Recognising the possibility of adverse behaviour towards employees who raise matters relating to health and safety in the workplace under section 27 of the Act, an employer is prohibited from penalising an employee for acting in accordance with or performing any duty or exercising any right under health and safety laws, or for making a complaint or a representation about safety and health to the safety representative or to the employer or to an inspector.In addition, where employees have concerns relating to health and safety in the workplace they can report them to the Health and Safety Authority's Workplace Contact Unit (Locall 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie).

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The number of redundant construction trades apprentices across all apprenticeship phases currently stands at 3,067 out of a global apprenticeship population of 24,774.  To address this situation the Government has introduced a number of new measures which are providing over 3,400 training places for redundant apprentices.  These measures include:The scheduling rules for off-the-job training have been amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training phases at Institutes of Technology.  This change has permitted a total of 302 apprentices to attend phase 2 training, 428 apprentices to attend phases 4 and 6 off-the-job training in 2008 and 1,115 apprentices to attend phase 4 and phase 6 training to date in 2009.The Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme, which commenced in January 2009, provides for the on-the-job training placement of up to 500 redundant apprentices with employers who have released their own employed apprentices for off-the-job training.FÁS and ESB Networks have agreed the placement on a phased basis of 400 redundant electrical apprentices over the period 2009-2010 to allow them to complete their on-the-job training and assessments.  Some 94 redundant electrical apprentices are currently completing their Phase 5 and Phase 7 on-the-job training.The Institutes of Technology are providing 700 places per annum on an 11-week certified training programme for those redundant apprentices who have completed their Phase 4 training but where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available for them.  The programme is divided into Construction and Engineering streams and provides redundant apprentices with education and training support in a number of relevant trades areas. The first programme is expected to commence in September 2009.Léargas has provided funding towards the cost of placing redundant Phase 7 apprentices with employers in Germany.  Some 20 apprentices are currently in Germany and a further 60 apprentice placements has been approved.FÁS with the support of relevant stakeholders is seeking to maximise all available opportunities for redundant apprentices to progress within the apprenticeship system and the situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis.

In that regard, any consumer who believes that they have suffered as a result of being misled in relation to the price of a good or service, including in relation to a property conveyancing service, may wish to contact the National Consumer Agency which is the body responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.

The making of rent schemes is an integral part of the housing management functions of local authorities, subject to broad principles laid down by the Minister for Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas.  These broad principles are as follows:the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income householdsallowances should be made for dependent children including those under 21 years of age in full-time educationa contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the householdprovision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship, andappropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwelling and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.Within these broad principles, authorities have discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and any other issues that arise in individual cases.  By definition, local authority rents should reflect ability to pay.  They bear no relation to economic rents in the private sector.Local authority rents are heavily subsidised at present.  In my view, it would not be appropriate, on the one hand, to provide subsidised housing to a person, at a rent which takes full account of ability to pay, and also offer a further subsidy through the tax system.  Furthermore, among the other advantages which local authority tenants enjoy are greater security of tenure vis-à-vis the wider rental sector and the right to buy the property at a market discount.

It is a condition of the relief that the spouse or former spouse must occupy the former marital home as his or her only or main residence, following the granting of the decree or the making of the deed of separation, but he or she does not necessarily have to still occupy it at a time when the person, who originally left the marital home, purchases a new home.  However, first-time purchaser Stamp Duty relief is denied to that person when, at the date of the decree or at the date the deed of separation is made, the person has an interest in another house/apartment apart from the former marital home.

Under the scheme, qualifying expenditure can be written off against a person's tax liability at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.However, as announced in the budget on 7 April last and as reflected in section 8 of the Finance Bill 2009 published last week, this scheme is to terminate on 31 December 2009 along with certain other health-related capital allowances schemes, subject to transitional arrangements for pipeline projects.  Under the transitional arrangements, if certain qualifying criteria are met, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is extended.The qualifying conditions depend on the type of work to be carried out and whether or not the work requires planning permission.  Where the work to be carried out does not require planning permission, the termination date is 30 June 2010 so long as at least 30% of the construction or refurbishment costs have been incurred on or before 31 December 2009.Where planning permission is required in relation to the work to be carried out, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority.  In such cases, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is 30 June 2011.  Thus, where planning permission for a nursing home has already been obtained, Finance Bill 2009 provides for qualifying expenditure to be incurred up to 30 June 2011.

A qualifying home loan is a loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of an individual's principal private residence.  The seven-year restriction applies to the interest payable on existing and on new qualifying home loans by both first-time buyers and non first-time buyers.If the remortgage was made for the purposes of repair, development or improvement of the individual's principal private residence then that element would qualify for seven years relief in its own right.  If however, the remortgage element was for a non-qualifying purpose such as buying a car or holiday the interest would not qualify for mortgage interest relief.  This was always the case.

Information can, however, be provided on an estimated basis to indicate the approximate net amounts of taxes paid (i.e. after allowing for repayments) by taxpayers in the construction industry in relation to VAT (not including VAT on imports), PAYE, Income tax non-PAYE, Corporation tax and Capital Gains Tax .On this basis the figures of yield under each tax head in each of the years 2005 to 2008 inclusive is estimated as follows:Tax head2005200620072008€m€m€m€mVAT9961,1521,072929PAYE726808859714Income Tax non-PAYE362368367185Corporation Tax336402355155Capital Gains Tax621939739The figures given for the construction industry are a revision of figures provided previously. The revision was necessitated because of the need to move from a basis of gross receipts (i.e. before allowing for repayments) that was used previously to a net receipts basis (i.e. net of repayments) now being used.  The net receipts basis is a more accurate measure of the net contribution of taxation but was not available at sector level when providing replies to questions previously raised.The figures for 2008 are preliminary and subject to revision.  Data on this basis are not readily available for years prior to 2005 and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of Revenue records. Notes:These figures are net receipts as provided by the Revenue Commissioners and differ slightly from the Exchequer receipts.The breakdown by trade sector for the tax heading "Income Tax (non-PAYE)" is based on sectoral information associated with direct tax payments from the self-employed only and is not available in respect of other subheads of non-PAYE income tax.The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit "NACE code (Rev. 1)" which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided.The figures provided for the estimated yield from the construction industry are confined to those activities which are defined as construction within the NACE codes and do not include the yield from activities and businesses identified under other NACE codes which could be  related, either in whole or in part, to the construction sector.

These figures refer to the total selling price prior to allowing any offsets or deductions and they do not reflect whether sale of the asset gave rise to a gain or a loss.  In addition, disposals which are exempt from CGT, such as the disposal of a principal private residence, will also, in some cases, be reflected in the consideration but not in the yield.  However, on this basis between 32% and 35% of disposals detailed on Form 11 as broken down by this aggregate consideration of asset value were from residential and commercial property in each of the years from 2002 to 2007.  Data for years prior to 2002 is not available and is not yet available for the tax year 2008 as the income tax returns for that year are not due for filing until October 2009.

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  The Act maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities — including all private child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools — are liable for rates.The basis of rateable valuation for all commercial property is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property.  Like all commercial properties the valuations of private child care facilities are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.Any individual ratepayer who has concerns about the valuation of their property or of any part thereof, including its rateability or the method of calculation may, on payment of a statutory fee of €250, apply to the Valuation Office for a revision of the valuation.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is also a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  I should also point out that the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act, 2001 and that I, as Minister for Finance, have no function in decisions in this regard.I have no plans to provide for special treatment of private child care facilities under the Valuation Act which provides that all buildings used for commercial enterprises are valued in a fair and equitable manner.  Exceptions to this key principle would be quickly followed by demands for similar treatment from other interests involved in commercial activity, which in equity would be difficult to resist.  The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding of local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers.

The margin is the difference between the price the dealer purchased and resold the second-hand car for.  In conjunction with the introduction of the Margin Scheme, special transitional arrangements were being put in place regarding second-hand cars in stock on the introduction of the scheme.The Margin Scheme would replace the existing special scheme for second-hand cars under which dealers-garages are entitled to immediate input credit for the residual VAT included in the price of a second-hand car acquired either through purchase or trade-in.  Under the special scheme dealers, when they resell the car, are required to repay this VAT input credit or VAT based on the resale price of the car, whichever is the greater.Since the supplementary budget further discussions have taken place with the motor industry concerning the proposed introduction of a VAT Margin Scheme for second-hand cars.  While SIMI expressed appreciation at the efforts made by the Government to try to assist the industry, they considered, in view especially of the difficult financing situation facing the industry, that on balance it would not be in its overall best interest for the Margin Scheme to be introduced at this time.  Consequently, the proposed Margin Scheme and transitional arrangements regarding existing stock of second-hand cars is not now being introduced.  It has, however, been agreed that there will be ongoing dialogue over the coming months with SIMI as to what other measures might be introduced to assist the motor industry, especially in regard to removing the current stock of second-hand cars held by dealers.

However I have a role because of my responsibility for public service pension policy and for public service expenditure generally.Under the terms of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (as amended) RTÉ pension schemes and arrangements are subject to the approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  This is similar to the provisions normally used when establishing a State body.My understanding is that late last year a new pension arrangement of a hybrid defined benefit/defined contribution scheme was proposed and was agreed to by Management and Unions.  The details of this new arrangement, including a draft Scheme, were submitted to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources seeking Ministerial approval and consent, as required under the governing legislation.  This correspondence was also copied to my Department by RTÉ.I can confirm that the specific issue raised by the Deputy concerning the delay in approving the scheme having an effect on the value of members' benefits has been brought to my attention.  As I said in an earlier reply, my officials are in discussion and consultation with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding the examination of the new RTÉ hybrid scheme and are considering this issue in that context and will conclude the matter as soon as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the normal practice when examining public service schemes is for all relevant service to be reckoned in the scheme, when it is approved.

Mortgage lenders in Ireland generally seek to recover costs of funds when a borrower with a fixed rate mortgage agreement seeks to terminate the agreement some time before the term agreed.On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator on the subject of customers who wish to switch from a fixed rate mortgage. On foot of that my Department has contacted the Financial Regulator to request confirmation that the redemption costs for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included in these charges. The Financial Regulator has confirmed to my Department that it is looking into this matter and that it will revert shortly.  Iwill advise the Deputy of the outcome of the Financial Regulator's consideration of thismatter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.I have not had any discussions with the company the Deputy refers to.  The Deputy will appreciate that a balance must be achieved by Government between influencing credit institutions through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support initiatives while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the day to day running of these institutions which must operate on a strictly commercial basis. The Government took the decisive step of nationalising Anglo Irish Bank because corporate governance issues emerged that caused serious reputational damage to the bank at a time when overall market sentiment towards it was negative.I would however like to point out to the Deputy that in response to the issue of credit availability in the mortgage sector, the Government has taken a number of important steps.  Firstly, I announced in Budget 2009 that a new mortgage scheme for first time buyers and for self-builds, the Home Choice Loan Scheme, would be introduced through the local authority system and is available through authorised mortgage brokers.  Secondly, as part of the terms of the recapitalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland, those banks will provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  The banks have also committed to actively promote mortgage lending at competitive rates, with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  I fully expect that the banks concerned will meet their commitments under the recapitalised scheme to increase the level of credit available nationally.Many lenders are conducting extensive advertising campaigns, showing that competition is a real factor on the mortgage scene.  The existence of that level of competition in the mortgage lending market is sufficient, I believe, to ensure that credit institutions will offer mortgages to suitably qualified customers in order to remain competitive and retain their share of the market.  As long as this remains to be the case, I see no need for the State to intervene in the market place by taking over the company referred to by the Deputy.

Provided the individuals referred to in the questions are members of such schemes and the lump sum payments comply with Revenue rules in this area, there is no liability to income tax on the retirement lump sums. In this regard, it should be noted that the tax arrangements for retirement lump sums apply in respect of pension schemes in both the public and private sectors.As I mentioned in my Budget Speech on 7 April last, the Commission on Taxation is examining various aspects of pension tax treatment, including the treatment of retirement lump sum payments, and I expect to be dealing with the Commission's recommendations in the 2010 Budget in December.

These include a €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund which is being established by each bank. One of the banks has already made some loans from its environmental and clean energy innovation fund. The other is about to launch its fund and I expect that it will make loans from its fund shortly.This should not be confused with a separate €100 million which was made available in the Budget for the establishment of an Enterprise Stabilisation Fund (Enterprise Development Fund).  This Fund is administered by Enterprise Ireland to help internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn.  Any questions on this should be addressed to my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The banks have also agreed to each provide €15m to a new seed capital fund with Enterprise Ireland. The banks funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland's Seed and Venture Capital Programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors. It is expected that much of these funds will be utilised by SMEs. Again any questions on this should be addressed to my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

Persons assessed to tax under these provisions are entitled to the married person's tax credit (currently, €3,660). These provisions only apply to married couples.  All other persons are assessed to tax as single persons in accordance with section 1016 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Such persons are entitled to the single person's tax credit (currently, €1,830).The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.In the particular circumstances outlined, as the couple are cohabiting rather than married, it is not permitted under existing legislation to transfer tax credits between the individuals.

Vacancies may be filled by redeployment of staff from other Departments or public bodies with my sanction. In relation to the Health and Education sectors the arrangements have been modulated to reflect the particular service needs in these areas.Heads of Departments and Offices have been advised that any exceptions to these arrangements would arise only in very limited circumstances and my specific prior sanction would be required on submission of a formal application in each case.  Requests for exemptions would have to demonstrate clearly that the post is essential to the delivery of a public service or performance of an essential function and that alternative arrangements, such as the reallocation of work, are not feasible in the circumstances.

The Government does not believe that it is fair to pay the same level of benefit irrespective of the level of income of the recipient. In times of scarce resources the Government believes support should be targeted at those most in need. My Department, together with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners are considering how best to achieve this policy objective. The tax treatment of child benefit is also being considered by the Commission on Taxation. I will be informed by its proposals on this matter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I assume the Deputy is referring to a single individual earning €80,000 per annum or more.  The position is that a single individual earning between €80,000 and €174,979 will have a marginal tax rate of 50% for 2009.  This is a combination of income tax at 41%, income levy at 4% and health levy at 5%.  In addition, an individual earning €174,980 or more will have a marginal tax rate of 52% for 2009.  This is a combination of income tax at 41%, income levy at 6% and health levy at 5%.It is important to note that the tax rate is just one factor used in calculating the actual tax an individual pays and should not be viewed in isolation. When tax credits and bands are taken into account, a single individual earner on €80,000 will now have an effective average tax rate of 36%.With regard to the recent ESRI study on the distributional impact of Budget 2009 and Supplementary Budget 2009, the findings show that disposable income for the lowest 20% of incomes will actually increase by almost 5%. This contrasts with a 7% decrease in disposable income for the highest earning 20% and demonstrates the Governments determination that budgetary measures should be as fair as possible. Those who are best able to pay, pay most while the more vulnerable in society are protected.The report notes that the marginal tax rate for higher earners has risen from 43.5% in 2008 to 52% in 2009. This is due to the introduction of the income levy and the doubling of the health levy rate, which was essential in order to provide fiscal balance in the extraordinary economic circumstances faced by the country.  However, in addition to the point raised in relation to the effective average tax rate, I would point out that that Ireland still continues to have a lower marginal tax rate for high earners when compared with a number of European competitors.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	358	For the purposes of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, Ireland is designated into two NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) II regions, namely the Border, Midland and Western (BMW) Region and the Southern and Eastern (S&E) Region.Under the EU Regulations, regions are classified for financial support based on economic characteristics, e.g population, regional prosperity, unemployment rate etc.  Objective one status was aimed at regions whose gross domestic product (GDP) was less than 75% of the European Union average, i.e.  those regions lagging behind in development terms.   The most recent Eurostat Statistics relating to 2005 has Ireland at 166% of the EU average.For the 2000-2006 Structural Funds, the designation of the country into two NUTS II regions maximised the Structural Funds allocation available to Ireland as the BMW region retained its objective one status and the S&E region qualified for a six-year phasing out regime for Objective One to the end of 2005.Objective One has been replaced by the Convergence Objective for the 2007-13 round of EU Structural Funds.  However, due to enlargement and our relative prosperity compared to the EU 27, neither of the Irish regions qualifies for funding under this objective.  Ireland qualifies under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective and have been allocated €750m for the period.The Mid-West Region, which comprises the counties of Clare, Limerick and North-Tipperary, is one of the eight Irish sub regions classified for statistical purposes as NUTS 3 regions and is one of the five constituent NUTS III Regional Authority areas which comprise the S&E Region.  The "Objective One" status refers to EU Structural Funds only and, therefore does not hinder the region's ability to attract investment.The Deputy may wish to note that my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has met with all of the State development agencies under the auspices of her Department, in the context of the job losses occurring in the Midwest region, and I am satisfied that they are working in a fully coordinated manner to take the appropriate actions to support workers in finding new employment, including assistance to re-skill and re-train to enhance their future employment potential.  In addition, the Tánaiste established the Mid West Task Force, chaired by Mr Denis Brosnan, in order to assess the particular impact on the wider regional economy of the Dell closure and associated job losses in other companies and is expected to provide an interim report shortly.

These areas are as follows: sport and other recreation; national culture (including the Irish language); the arts (within the meaning of the Arts Act, 1951); health of the community; and for such other purposes as the Government may determine.  The following additional categories have been so determined: youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities.

If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs. AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met. Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator. Both institutions have met with officials from my Department to give details of the steps they are taking to implement these measures.An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly. Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis.I should also add that a Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March. This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner. The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints. Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice. This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.This range of measures has been introduced to ensure that the banks continue to lend to credit worthy individuals and businesses in the real economy.

These discussions have focused on both the possible sources of additional funding and on what steps would be required to access such funding.  A number of meetings have taken place, and further meetings will be arranged as appropriate.I would note that we are already spending a considerable sum on Capital this year — 5% of GNP — one of the highest ratios in the world.  This supports a substantial level of employment while the reductions in tender prices mean that we can do more with less.  Nonetheless, the Government is prepared to look at new ways to fund needed capital investment and support activity and employment in the construction sector provided:the terms are right and in the taxpayers favour;the investment makes economic sense;value for money is secured; andthe private sector shares the appropriate level of risk so as not to have a disproportionate impact on the public finances.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	362	As the Deputy will be aware mortgage borrowers with variable rate mortgages have benefited from very significant reductions in mortgage interest rates over recent months in line with the very substantial reductions in ECB interest rates.  In respect of the covered institutions my Department has been informed by the Financial Regulator that all of the covered institutions have fully passed on each ECB interest rate cut to variable rate owner occupiers since the Credit Institutions Financial Support scheme was introduced up to and including the ECB cut announced on 2 April 2009.The decision on pass through of ECB rate reductions to variable rate mortgages is a commercial decision for the financial institution concerned.  This decision will reflect a range of different factors including funding costs, market conditions,  profitability and business strategy as well as the competitive environment overall.  The Deputy will appreciate it is a core function of the Board and senior management of each institution to assess where the appropriate balance lies between these competing objectives particularly in ensuring the financial health and commercial viability of the relevant institution.  It is not an appropriate role for the Minister for Finance to seek to determine this decision making by financial institutions operating under competitive market conditions.As far as the covered institutions are concerned and those participating in the Recapitalisation Programme the objective is to ensure that the credit needs of the real economy including house purchasers are met.  In this context, as Minister for Finance I have consistently made a strong case for the full pass- through of ECB interest rate reductions from the relatively high levels they stood at last year.  ECB rates are now at very low levels.  Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that credit institutions are not primarily funded from the ECB but from a variety of sources and the cost of such funding may not be in line with the very low level of ECB rates.In view of its statutory consumer protection mandate, the Financial Regulator will continue to monitor the level of mortgage interest rates.  It is, of course, important that prospective mortgage borrowers considering a variable rate mortgage at the present time factor in the potential impact on their repayments of changes in financial conditions in the coming years.

The scheme will allow children to avail of a free playschool place in their pre-school year, which will be provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow children in their pre-school year who are attending full day or part-time day-care services to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year.  Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.  Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full-day or part-time childcare, the service will be required to reduce the childcare fees by the amount of the capitation.  A participating service may also operate a pre-school service which is not within the scheme.While the scheme will normally be required to provide services on a five day per week basis, transitional arrangements will apply during the initial period of January to August 2010, to allow services to adjust to the requirements of the new scheme.  During this period, services which are already accommodating children on a pro rata basis, may continue to do so and the capitation grant will be set by reference to the number of children attending per day rather than the total number of children per week.To ensure that a satisfactory standard of pre-school provision is delivered, a minimum enrolment of 8 children is envisaged.  Exceptions will be considered where, for good reason and subject to compliance with all other contractual requirements governing the scheme, a service has an enrolment of at least 5 children in their pre-school year or there is a minimum enrolment of 8 children of which at least 3 are in their pre-school year and the remainder would be eligible in the following year.

Full and part-time day-care services will receive €48.50 per week where children attend for 50 weeks with 11 hours, 15 minutes per week free pre-school provision.  Playschool sessional services may also participate on the basis of 11 hours, 15 minutes per week over 50 weeks.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.As private sector services, it is a matter for each participating service to manage its business affairs including how the service aligns itself with the provisions of the scheme.  However, it is noted that services  participating in the free pre-school year scheme may charge parents for additional services which they provide, including additional hours and additional activities or services provided these are offered on an optional basis to parents and provided appropriate programme based activities are provided to children not participating in an additional activity.

A significant number of capital grant applications, including that of the applicant in question, were due to be considered for approval in the latter part of 2008.As the Deputy will be aware it became necessary at that point to review Government expenditure, particularly in regard to new expenditure commitments.  This process was finalised last month and all capital grant applicants under the NCIP were advised that funding could not be approved at this point under the programme.  The capital allocation available to the NCIP is sufficient to meet existing capital grant commitments but is not expected to allow for the approval of any additional grant applications in 2009 or 2010.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I propose to take Questions Nos. 175, 176, 180, 184, 209 and 212 to 215, inclusive, together.The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January, 2009.  Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention as well as from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards.  As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically.  We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including with the Russian Federation.Officials in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs, have been taking soundings since April, 2008, in relation to inter-country adoption in the Russian Federation.  This has included contacts with the Irish Embassy in Moscow and legal and other preparatory work on the possibility of a draft Inter-Country Adoption Agreement between the two countries.  A first formal meeting was arranged with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This meeting of officials of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland took place in the last week.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation.  However, I would respectfully suggest that any applicant seeking to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague country, or from a country with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement, should have regard to the likelihood of the adoption being completed in advance of the Bill being commenced.With regard to the issue of outstanding post-placement reports, these are a requirement of a number of countries that send children to be adopted by Irish applicants.  In order to provide assurance to the Russian Federation, the Health Service Executive has furnished a letter to indicate their on-going part in the provision of such reports and to their status as the statutory body with responsibility for child protection.  This letter was provided at the request of applicants who may have experienced queries in relation to arrangements for the provision of such reports.  The Health Service Executive has no statutory function in relation to the provision of post-placement reports, though it has and continues to facilitate the preparation of same.  The key commitment given is the legal affidavit to co-operate with the provision of such reports that is required by the Russian Authorities from all applicants.  Where parents do not co-operate, there is no legal basis to enforce their co-operation with post-adoption reporting in this jurisdiction.My Office has been in touch with the Health Service Executive to clarify the situation in relation to any such list of outstanding reports.  The Executive has confirmed that reports continue to be supplied from all regions and that it is following up in respect of reports which may be completed but not yet transmitted.  Over 450 such reports were required in respect of 2008, and it is anticipated that around 400 will be required in respect of 2009 (not all due yet).  The Health Service Executive in all ten areas has conducted an extensive search for these alleged "missing" post-placement reports and has identified in respect of 2008 and 2009, in total, some 34 which are due and have not yet been transmitted.  The majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation — that is, the Social Workers have already conducted the home visit and the report.In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their Social Worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the Health Service Executive Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.  From information available at this stage, only one report has been "delayed" due to scheduling difficulties.  I am given to understand that a re-scheduled visit is due to take place in relation to this particular case.  In this regard, it should be noted that while the Adoption Board facilitates the transmission of completed reports to the Russian authorities, there is neither formal agreement nor obligation on the Board to do so.Officials from my Office had an opportunity to raise the matter with the Russian Embassy at a recent meeting.  The Russian side has provided a list of outstanding reports.  This list, which was collated by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science, is currently being validated by the Embassy.  In the meantime, I have asked the relevant authorities to assist me in pursuing the resolution of the issue as a matter of urgency.  Officials have also indicated to the Russian side the importance that we are attaching to resolving the matter.  I have also requested that this matter be raised directly with the Russian authorities.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 220 together.I am arranging for the Deputy to be provided with the most recent statistics prepared by the Health Services Executive regarding inter-country adoption assessment services.  I am very aware of the lengthy waiting time especially in some regions.  My officials have been working with the HSE and the Adoption Board to assess ways of streamlining the current process and ensure that delays are reduced in so far as possible.  This work is continuing as part of the preparations for the new legislative regime for adoption generally.However, it must also be recognised that the demand for inter-country adoption has been increasing at an exponential rate over the last number of years.  I understand from the HSE that over 370 first time assessments were completed in 2008 and over 170 second time assessments — a total of around 550.  In addition to this increasing figure, the number of post adoption reports required has also been increasing.  In 2008 around 1350 post adoption reports were completed.  This is now considered to take around 28% of total social work time spent on the inter-country adoption process.  Resourcing adoption assessment services has to be considered in the context of other child welfare and protection services provided by the Health Services Executive.  The adoption service does not sit within a vacuum but has to be managed against competing priorities.  Notwithstanding that, every effort has been made by the HSE to protect and improve the service over a number of years.Under existing legislation assessments for adoption can be undertaken by registered adoption societies and a small number of societies continue to provide the service.  Their focus is primarily on domestic adoption services.  PACT provides an inter-country adoption service and continues to undertake a small number of assessments on behalf of the HSE.  The Adoption Bill, 2009 currently before the Seanad develops a new regime for the accreditation of a range of agencies providing adoption services.  This modernised regime more fully recognises the phenomenon of inter-country adoption and makes provision for the accreditation of agencies to provide assessment services or mediation services.  The Bill also proposes changes to the regulation of the activities, management and financial arrangements of such agencies.  If enacted, there will be opportunity for the development of new agencies to assist in the reduction of waiting times in those areas where the waiting times are longest.I am considering alternative arrangements to the current system for processing inter-country adoptions with a view to reducing the length of time that these applications are taking due to the fact that the HSE Child Protection Services have to be provided by the same staff.

This meeting of officials of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland took place in the last week.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.I do not place more importance on either one country or another as regards the conclusion of inter-country adoption agreements.  However, I and my predecessors took the pragmatic decision to prioritise the continuation of an existing proven agreement with the most popular country of choice for Irish applicants.  As I say, work on the Russian situation has continued over this time and other countries, in particular Ethiopia are also under active consideration by my officials.The number of entries made in the Register of Foreign Adoptions in 2008 in respect of children from Russia was 117 and in respect of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 182.  I cannot at this stage provide the numbers sought the Deputy in relation to the letters of introduction or referrals as they are also known.  I will endeavour to do so through the relevant agencies and will contact your office separately.It is not possible to provide an accurate count of emails and letters received by my Office, my Office's email post box and officials over the last month at this time.  It has been substantial.  My officials continue to respond in as timely a fashion as possible.  I have also been communicating directly with the relevant support groups and other representatives on a regular basis and providing information through the OMCYA website at www.omcya.ie to ensure a continued dialogue in relation to the current developments in inter-country adoption.

This will form part of a suite of schemes which will also include the incentivised scheme for early retirement (ISER) and the shorter working year scheme.  These three initiatives were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009.  The details of the schemes and the arrangements which will apply in the health sector are being finalised by my Department and it is intended that a circular on the matter will issue to the relevant organisations in the coming week.

In addition, an extensive mapping exercise has been undertaken by the HSE and a number of measures in relation to maintaining and increasing GP numbers have been identified and are currently being progressed.These include the following:Ongoing engagement with the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Medical Council in relation to increasing the number of GP training places within available resources and exploring alternative models of GP training.Active management in each Local Health Office to encourage GP assistantship and partnership in relation to upcoming retirements where such doctors could potentially take over from the retiring GPs.Recruitment drives in the UK and EU countries to attract qualified GPs to apply for available posts in Ireland, particularly regions experiencing difficulties attracting GPs.Issuing of new GMS numbers in regions urgently requiring additional GPs.  This is being undertaken in accordance with the established consultation process with the Irish Medical Organisation.Continued expansion of Primary Care Teams and Primary Care Centres so that GPs applying for posts are attracted to high quality, well supported posts in suitable premises.  To date, 110 teams are at an advanced functioning level (holding clinical team meetings on individual client cases) and the Health Service Executive has indicated that it plans to have 210 teams in place by the end of 2009.In addition to the above, research has been undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs on behalf of the Joint Department of Health and Children / HSE Working Group on Workforce Planning.  This research, conducted by FÁS on behalf of the Expert Group, analysed the labour market for 12 healthcare occupations, including GPs.  The research, which is expected to be finalised in a few months, will help determine future GP workforce planning and training needs.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I propose to take Questions Nos. 185, 210, 217 to 219, inclusive, and 252 together.Work in relation to a draft Bi-lateral Agreement for Inter-country Adoption with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has been ongoing for over fourteen months.  During this period there have been three visits by officials from this Department to Hanoi — including the most recent visit — to discuss the draft text of an agreement and many options, including possible transitional arrangements, have also been considered during this period.Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations.  A draft Bi-lateral Agreement for Inter-country Adoption was delivered on 6 March, 2009, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.  On 2 April, 2009, the Vietnamese Government invited a delegation from Ireland to visit the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to discuss the provisions of the draft Bi-Lateral Agreement provided.  An Irish delegation travelled to Hanoi on the week commencing on 20 April, 2009 — the earliest opportunity provided to meet with the relevant Vietnamese Ministries — for an intensive round of discussions on this draft Bi-lateral Agreement.  The delegation was led by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) and was assisted in discussions by the Adoption Board.  Discussions were facilitated and guided locally by the Irish Embassy in Hanoi.  The meetings were progressive but a number of residual issues remain outstanding — and discussions on these issues are ongoing.I would like to again reiterate my personal commitment, and the commitment of the Government, to continue with these discussions with a view to bringing them to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.  It is anticipated that further proposals to advance the discussions will be made to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the coming week.  It is also anticipated that the Vietnamese side will revert with proposals on their part shortly.  I do not wish to speculate on the timeframe or outcome of these negotiations as these are genuinely difficult to determine.  What I can say is that efforts on the Irish side are intensive and will continue to be so in the coming weeks.  I can also say that there has been a high level of engagement on both sides.  It is clear from progress so far that there is a willingness on both sides to bring these matters to a successful conclusion, if at all possible.  The need for a further visit will be guided by the developments in the coming days and weeks. I am committed to travelling to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam at any time to facilitate the successful conclusion of these discussions, as and when appropriate.In accordance with Section 5 of the Adoption Act, 1991, an initial Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is only valid for 12 months.  The Adoption Board has no discretion in this matter.  The Board, however, may grant an extension to a Declaration if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proper to do so.  In order for the Board to decide whether it is reasonable and proper to do so, the Board requires applicants to make a Statutory Declaration that there have been no material changes in their circumstances.Should the applicants apply for a subsequent extension, the Board feels that it is reasonable and proper to request the HSE to carry out an update on the original assessment as it is now over two years since the applicants were first assessed and changes may have taken place in their family make-up or in their employment status.  This procedure applies to all countries equally.  However, the Deputy will be pleased to know that provisions contained in the Adoption Bill, 2009, allow for a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to be valid for 24 months, with the possibility of a further 12-month extension, subject to Adoption Board discretion.The decision regarding the country of choice from which to adopt is a matter for prospective applicants.  This choice obviously should have regard to their personal preference, their knowledge of and/or connection with the proposed country of origin, and the status of the country as a contracting State either to the Hague Convention or to a bilateral agreement.While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement with countries from which children have traditionally been adopted by Irish applicants, in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Governments of these sovereign states.  However, I would respectfully suggest that any applicant seeking to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague country or a country with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement should have regard to the likelihood of the adoption being completed in advance of the Bill being commenced.Ireland has a long and positive relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, but I must also emphasise the need to respect the authority of that jurisdiction, having regard to the sensitive nature of discussions regarding inter-country adoption.

According to data provided by the HPSC, TB notifications in Ireland between 2004 and 2008 (provisional data) were as shown in the following table.YearNumber of Cases2004432200545020064652007 (Provisional)4782008 (Provisional)437Provisional figures from 2008 indicate a decrease in the number of TB notifications in the country.  The number reported during 2008 is less than that reported in any year since 2004.A number of disciplines in the health service are involved in the management of TB cases and prevention of TB in other individuals.  The services involved include hospital, primary care and public health.  Various disciplines will be involved in the diagnosis, care and follow-up of individuals with TB and their contacts (nurses, doctors, radiologists, laboratory staff, social workers etc.)  Individuals with TB may require hospitalisation if severely ill or with infection that is highly resistant to treatment.  Multidrug (typically four drugs to start with) antibiotic treatment is usually of 6 months duration but may be longer.  In some individuals with antibiotic resistant TB additional antibiotics may be required.The National TB Advisory Committee has developed guidelines (being finalised after a consultation period) for the prevention and control of Tuberculosis in Ireland.  These guidelines include recommendations on Surveillance, Screening, Preventive therapy, Clinical management of cases, Laboratory diagnosis, BCG vaccination, HIV infection and tuberculosis, and review the epidemiology of tuberculosis and provide advice as required to the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) immunisation committee on the use of vaccines to prevent cases of tuberculosis.  When a TB case in the community is identified, the notification process ensures that close contacts are followed up and investigated to determine if they have infected and if treatment is required.  This process is implemented in all HSE areas routinely.The BCG vaccine is given to protect against tuberculosis.  BCG has contributed to the dramatic decline in TB over the past 40 years.  The national rate of BCG immunisation uptake now stands at 93% for children at 12 months of age.  Vaccination is not mandatory in Ireland, but is strongly recommended by my Department.  Under the Childhood Immunisation Programme all vaccines and their administration are provided free of charge for all children.

The change is being implemented on a phased basis and is designed to deliver a better and more cost effective service.The Executive reports that there are no plans to close any of the local offices that currently process medical card applications and there have been no changes to the staffing allocation levels at the PCRS. However, the process will involve a reassignment of existing human resources within the HSE.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications. Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours.Local Health Offices will continue to provide advice and necessary supports to people applying for medical cards. They will also deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and, along with the HSE National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will handle enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements.The new arrangements will also deliver significant efficiencies by making greater use of shared services for both internal administration and direct service delivery.This is a good example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November. It demonstrates how the HSE can deliver improved services within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	399	My Office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks which will ensure a well regulated regime of adoption. Our aim is to support and protect prospective parents, and even more importantly, the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.My views on intercountry adoption are informed by the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption and the Good Practice Guide associated with it. The child's best interests are the fundamental principle that supports the development of a national child care and protection system as well as an ethical, child-centred approach to intercountry adoption. Intercountry adoption does not occur in a vacuum — it occurs across jurisdictions and spans complex areas of family law, child protection and welfare. It must be legislated for, managed and understood in that context. It requires a shared responsibility and respect between States in order to ensure the best ethical practices to support the child's best interests; and to safeguard against abduction, sale or trafficking of children.Ireland has a very strong tradition of intercountry adoption and indeed was once a so-called "sending" country. My aim is to support that tradition continuing by assuring prospective adopters, the countries of origin of prospective adoptees, the birth families of the children and, looking into the future, the children themselves, that intercountry adoption was undertaken in the best interests of the child, to the required standard, with adequate safeguards and protections for all concerned.As the Deputy is likely aware, the Adoption Bill 2009 is currently before the Seanad. I firmly believe that the Adoption Bill, which includes the regime of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child. As such, it is our intention that all intercountry adoption will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	400	The HSE has no statutory function in relation to the provision of post-placement reports, though it has and continues to facilitate the preparation of same.  The key commitment given is the legal affidavit to co-operate with the provision of such reports, required by the Russian authorities from all applicants. Where parents do not co-operate there is no legal basis to enforce their co-operation with post-adoption reporting in this jurisdiction. The Adoption Board facilitates the transmission of completed reports to the Russian authorities. However, there is no formal agreement, nor obligation on the Board to do so. Effectively, the responsibility rests with the adoptive parents.Following a request from the Minister, the Health Service Executive has confirmed that reports continue to be supplied from all regions and that it is following up in respect of reports which may be completed but not yet transmitted. Over 450 such reports were required in respect of 2008 and it is anticipated that around 400 will be required in respect of 2009 (not all due yet). The HSE in all ten areas has conducted an extensive search for these alleged "missing" post-placement reports and, in total, some 34 have been identified as not yet transmitted. This is for reports due in the period 2008 and to date in 2009.  The majority of the outstanding reports have been completed and are with the adoptive parents for translation, apostilling and notarisation, that is, the Social Workers have already conducted the home visit and the prepared the requisite report.  In a small number of cases, parents have neglected or have been unwilling or unable to arrange for a home visit with their Social Worker.  Further contact has been made again to arrange for all outstanding visits to be undertaken and is being prioritised by the HSE Adoption Services to ensure that the parents can have the required reports forwarded to the Russian Embassy.Following contact with the Russian Embassy in Dublin, further checks are now being undertaken with regard to outstanding reports which may pre-date this period (i.e. 2008 and to date 2009). The Minister has requested the assistance of the HSE and the Adoption Board in bringing this matter resolution and further steps will be taken this week to advance the matter. Liaison with the Russian Embassy in Dublin in relation to the matter will continue.From the information available to the Minister the HSE completed over 450 reports last year in respect of children adopted from the Russian Federation. There is no suggestion that these reports are not meeting the required standard. The difficulty referred to relates to "missing" reports. In contrast, the PACT undertook around 7 reports last year. Clearly this is primarily an issue of volume and relates to a build up over a number of years of activity.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.The Russian Federation, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China are, respectively, the first, third and fourth most popular destinations for Irish persons who seek to adopt children from abroad.  According to the most up-to-date foreign adoption statistics available from the Adoption Board, a total of 1,229 Russian, 636 Vietnamese and 359 Chinese children were entered into the Register of Foreign Adoptions between 1991 and 2008.  This amounted to, respectively, 30.98%, 16.03% and 9.05% of the total number of foreign children (i.e. 3,966) who were formally adopted by Irish persons during that period.More specifically, between 2004 and 2008, the following totals were entered into the Register of Foreign Adoptions:from the Russian Federation: 189 in 2004, 131 in 2005, 143 in 2006, 160 in 2007 and 117 in 2008;from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam: 16 in 2004, 92 in 2005, 68 in 2006, 130 in 2007 and 182 in 2008, andfrom the People's Republic of China: 60 in 2004, 52 in 2005, 33 in 2006, 31 in 2007 and 19 in 2008.This represents an average, during that five-year period, of 148 adoptions from the Russian federation, of 98 adoptions from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and of 39 adoptions from the People's Republic of China per annum.Currently, an administrative arrangement operates between Ireland and the People's Republic of China.  The People's Republic of China is a contracting State under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption and, as such, a bilateral agreement is not, nor will not be, required between Ireland and the People's Republic of China in relation to adoption.With regard to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the existing bilateral agreement expired on 1 May, 2009.  Discussions are on-going in relation to a further agreement.  I do not wish to speculate on the timeframe or outcome of these negotiations as these are genuinely difficult to determine.  What I can say is that efforts on the Irish side are intensive and will continue to be so in the coming weeks.  I can also say that there has been a high level of engagement on both sides.  It is clear from progress so far that there is a willingness on both sides to bring these matters to a successful conclusion, if at all possible.While my priority at this point has been to secure a new bilateral agreement with Vietnam, my Office is also undertaking preparatory work on a draft bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Russian Federation.  Officials in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs, have been taking soundings since April, 2008, in relation to inter-country adoption in the Russian Federation.  This has included contacts with the Irish Embassy in Moscow and legal and other preparatory work on the possibility of a draft Inter-Country Adoption Agreement between the two countries.A first formal meeting was arranged with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This meeting of officials of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland took place in the last week.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 241 together.As hospital doctors do not have General Medical Services (GMS) contracts, prescriptions written by them for medical card holders are not reimbursable under the GMS scheme.  Such prescriptions must be transcribed by the patient's GMS-contracted general practitioner to a GMS form, in line with the audit and governance procedures applying to the scheme.  The prescription can then be dispensed by a pharmacy that holds a community pharmacy contract.  Under emergency dispensing arrangements for patients who have been in-patients of Acute General Hospitals or who have attended the Accident/Emergency Departments of General Hospitals, GMS patients can obtain a short term supply of a hospital prescription from a community pharmacy, where it would not be possible or practical to contact their GP within a reasonable period.People with specified conditions receive without charge, drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  LTI patients are issued with a book which contains the type and quantity of the drugs or medicines required for their specified illness.  In the event of their discharge from hospital after treatment for their primary condition, patients take their hospital prescription to their local Health Service Executive Office (HSE) to seek approval for its addition to their LTI book, in line with the audit and governance procedures applying to that scheme.  Products for the treatment of illnesses other than their primary condition are available according to the patient's eligibility e.g medical card holder or under the Drugs Payment Scheme.  Some people who are eligible for the Long Term Illness Scheme also hold a medical card, which means that they are entitled to access all their medications free of charge, rather than just those required for the treatment of their long term illness and therefore must return to their GP to have their prescription transcribed to a GMS form.In line with clinical best practice it is considered worthwhile that patients have contact with their general practitioner after leaving hospital, establishing a valuable link between primary and secondary care services that might otherwise be less frequent.  The estimated number of visits to general practitioners in 2008 to rewrite prescriptions issued on discharge from hospital is a service matter and has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Students are sponsored by health agencies and spend time over three years in clinical placements in different specialties; course work and a thesis must be also satisfactorily completed.  The number of training places in clinical psychology is dependent on the availability of clinical placements.  A Working Group to undertake a National Review of Clinical Psychology Training Places is in place within the Health Service Executive and accordingly I am referring the Deputy's question to the Executive for attention and direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Organisations such as An Bord Altranais are established under statute.  In the case of An Bord Altranais (The Nursing Board), it was established under the Nurses Act, 1985, and is the statutory regulatory body for nurses and midwives.  The Board consists of 29 members, 17 of whom are elected by nurses and 12 appointed by the Minister, 2 of whom are representatives of the Department of Health and Children.  Under the Act the Minister has a range of functions in relation to the Board one of which, Section 17(1), relates to the officers and servants of the Board "In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, there shall be appointed such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Board, as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines."The Act also provides that the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 applies to the Board and its officers and servants as if it were a local authority.  In addition to its statutory functions, the Board also administers the Nursing Careers Centre on behalf of the Health Services.  For this purpose ongoing funding is provided by the HSE and the amount of this funding in 2007 was €600,000.While the bulk of the Board's income is generated by fees paid by nurses and midwives, it and bodies similar to it,  are statutory bodies whose staff have access to a public service pension scheme.  They are thus covered by the recent Government decision that, with effect from the 27 March 2009 to end 2010, no post in the public sector, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The decision also applies to temporary appointments on a fixed-term basis and to the renewal of such contracts.  Therefore, when vacancies arise each agency must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.  In the case of the health sector, any exceptions to this principle, which will arise in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	426	The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) initiated a quality review of symptomatic breast cancer services in 2008.  The overall objective of the review was to assess the performance of the designated cancer centres against the National Quality Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services and assist in devising an implementation plan for incremental progress to becoming specialist cancer centres by the end of 2009.There are a number of phases in the process of meeting the entire range of standards involved.  The first was a self-assessment completed and submitted by each individual hospital in Spring, 2008.  The second phase involved an independent validation by HIQA, in October 2008, of the Spring self-assessment process.  In January 2009, HIQA issued individual interim reports to each of the designated centres.  These were based on data from the self-assessments carried out in Spring, 2008 and were not an inspection of the status of the centres in October, 2008.  The interim reports were copied to the CEO of the HSE, the Secretary General of my Department and to the Interim Director of the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) in January, 2009.The interim reports provide the centres with details of the standards that are being met and of where gaps exist. Significant progress has been made by all of the designated cancer centres in addressing the gaps in systems and services. There is ongoing liaison also between the NCCP and HIQA about compliance with the standards.The individual hospitals have prepared implementation plans in conjunction with the NCCP, which are now being implemented and monitored by the NCCP.  A further inspection and assessment by HIQA is planned for the end of 2009, and these reports will be published.

The review is carried out prior to expiry to determine the card holder's current eligibility status under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  Under the new medical card scheme for persons aged 70 and over, the application and review process have been simplified and the HSE only requires information relating to the gross income of the person and his/her dependants.  This is in accordance with the Health Act, 2008, which provided for the new arrangements, relieving those aged 70 and over of a major burden in making an application for a medical card, while ensuring that those with significant incomes no longer retain automatic entitlement.

The RTP groups are, therefore, responsible for deciding on the specific services to be provided and the methods of provision.

In light of the revised arrangements that came into effect on 27 March last, I have now sought the sanction of the Minister for Finance to finalise that process.As I have indicated previously, final decisions on the agreed staff numbers of the Dublin Transport Authority will only be taken following the receipt of proposals from the Authority in that regard as provided for under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.

Currently, it is anticipated that the existing DART line will be extended (through electrification) as far as Drogheda, the Maynooth line would be fully electrified as far as Maynooth itself and that the Kildare line would be electrified as far as Hazelhatch.Work is continuing on the preparation of a Railway Order in respect of the tunnel between Inchicore and the Northern Line element of the DART Underground project, with a view to its submission to An Bord Pleanála later this year. Similarly, Railway Orders will be required for the extension of the electrification elements of the DART Underground project. Iarnród Éireann expects to submit a Railway Order in respect of the extension to Drogheda in 2012.The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects in planning, such as the DART Underground project, will in each case be determined by the outcome of public consultation, the statutory planning approval process, the public procurement process and the availability of financial resources determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. As I have stated in the past the provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining public transport priorities in the period ahead. In that context, the DART Underground is a particularly important rail investment.As I am sure you will appreciate, to ensure value for money to the taxpayer, estimated costs are not released in advance of the signing of contracts for projects such as those in the DART Underground programme.

However these are temporary and thousands of test appointments have successfully been made in the last few weeks.Prior to 1st May 2009, the use of a vehicle without a valid NCT certificate was already an offence that carried a fine of up to €2,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months or both. Since the 1st May 2009 it is an offence to which penalty points will be applied on conviction, in addition to any fine or imprisonment.Enforcement is a matter for An Garda Síochána and penalties a matter for the courts.

It should be noted that changing a light bulb would not be considered an urgent matter and would fall to be dealt with by the prison service trades staff.Emergency call outs are paid for at a fixed hourly rate of €69.00. The payment is made only in respect of time on site in a prison and no payment arises in relation to travelling time, or retainer fees. There is also no minimum call out charge.

On 8 May, 2009, there were 3,934 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 3,641.   The following table provides a breakdown of the population of each prison/place of detention on that date.Prison/Place of DetentionBed CapacityNo. in CustodyArbour Hill Prison148156Castlerea Prison228279Cloverhill Prison431465Cork Prison272294Dóchas Centre85112Limerick Prison (male)275299Limerick Prison (female)2026Loughan House150134Midlands Prison469509Mountjoy Prison (male)540670Portlaoise Prison210105Shelton Abbey10096St. Patrick’s Institution216248Training Unit107112Wheatfield Prison390429Totals3,6413,934Imprisonment for non-payment of debt was abolished by the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1872. However, refusal to pay a contractual debt may amount to civil contempt of court, for which imprisonment may be imposed. There are no immediate proposals to amend the law in this area although operation of the law is being kept under review in my Department.  Moreover, debt enforcement forms part of the work of the Law Reform Commission. Government policy in this area is also reflected in the significant funding made available to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which provides assistance to people on low incomes who need help to cope with debt problems. There are 53 independent companies nationwide with over 240 money advice staff operating the service. MABS National Telephone Helpline has operated since October 2007.  Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, the Credit Union Movement, Citizens Information Centres, Centres for the unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme.I can advise the Deputy that the number of persons held in custody for such offences at any one time is a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, figures relating to 8 May, 2009 indicate that 20, or 0.5 percent, of the numbers in prison custody fell into this category.

Consequently it is not  operationally practical to set limits for the number of prisoners held within the prison system.The Irish Prison Service has been experiencing serious pressure on numbers during the last 12-18 months and in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit.  This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.  Also in 2008, 70 new prison spaces were introduced at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House Open Centres.As the pressure shows no sign of abating the Irish Prison Service recently decided to increase their capacities through the doubling up of further cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit, thus creating 200 additional temporary bed spaces, some of which are already in place and others coming on stream shortly.Furthermore, I am glad to confirm that  an additional 400 spaces will come on stream shortly with the completion of building projects in Castlerea, Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons.  It is my strong view that the continuation of the current capital programme is essential if we are to limit, as far as practicable, overcrowding so that we can accommodate our prisoner population in regime orientated modern prisons.

The person in question was informed by letter dated 8 November 2006 of the termination of the IBC/05 Scheme.Since the termination of that Scheme, there is no longer any separate procedure or stand-alone right of any person to apply for permission to remain in the State on the sole basis of parentage of a child born in Ireland. However, the person's case is currently being assessed by the relevant officials and the person concerned will be contacted directly and notified of any decisions made regarding his status in the State in due course.

On 8 May, 2009 it was operating at slightly in excess of this capacity with 112 prisoners in custody.  I am satisfied that the current staffing levels and facilities at the Training Unit are quite adequate and that a safe environment is provided for both prisoners and staff at the facility.  In relation to the recommendation of the Labour Relations Commission regarding a particular staffing issue at the Training Unit, I can inform the Deputy that discussions in relation to this recommendation are ongoing between the Irish Prison Service and the Staff Association.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	465	My Department does not engage consultants to act as lobbyists on its behalf. However, on occasion, consultants engaged by my Department do engage in activity outside the State.  For example, in 2007, KPMG were commissioned to undertake a Value for Money Review of the Irish Passport Service. In assessing efficiency and effectiveness, the review used the services operated in Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK as international comparators, and travel to those countries, acting on behalf of the Department, was required. The total cost of the review, including the cost of the fieldwork outside the State, was €71,384. Copies of the report were lodged with the Houses of the Oireachtas in November 2008 and the report is also published on the Department's website.  Similarly, Value for Money Reviews of other areas of the Department's work, such as our support for emigrants and Irish Aid assistance to fight HIV/AIDS, as well as the Management Review of Irish Aid, have required field work by consultants to be undertaken outside the State.Given the nature of its work, the Irish Aid programme utilises independent technical advisors on specific projects and programmes outside the State. These offer technical advice on sectors such as water, education, health, governance, evaluation, and other relevant areas to assist the aid programme, recipient governments, local authorities, NGOs and the other organisations. My Department is happy to provide more detail on all of these projects and programmes to the Deputy.While the Department does not pay lobbyists to work on its behalf, there are occasions where the Department has provided funding for lobby groups or advocacy organisations through grant in aid mechanisms such as the Emigrant Support Programme. For example, through the Emigrant Support Programme, the Government has allocated grant-in-aid to a number of independent organisations that advocate on behalf of Irish citizens abroad, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, which, since 2006, has received grants totalling $235,000.

The Turkish Government has proposed the establishment of a joint commission, composed of eminent academics, to investigate and determine the facts of this tragic episode in their shared history.While it has not yet been possible to move forward on the basis of this proposal, last month's announcement of a roadmap for the normalisation of relations between Armenia and Turkey is a positive step for the two countries' relations. I hope it will lead to the opening of diplomatic missions and the re-establishment of trade links that were cut off by the closure of the common border in 1993.  Although official details of the roadmap have not yet been made public, it appears likely that it will indeed include a mechanism to allow for a joint study of the period and an investigation of claims relating to Armenian deaths. This may lead to a common understanding of the tragic events. I am sure the Deputy shares my view that due regard must be had to the sensitivity of the issues involved and that we should support all efforts to resolve them.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, the question of the location of public swimming pools is essentially a matter for local authorities.  Projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Department's annual estimates provision for the Programme.There are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  The Department and its technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department of Arts, Sport & Tourism.  The Department has requested a Preliminary Report for the Balbriggan Swimming Pool and this is currently being examined by the OPW from a technical point of view.  Once the project is acceptable to the OPW from a technical point of view I will then be in a position to approve the Preliminary Report allowing Fingal County Council to proceed to the next stage which is the preparation of Contract Documents.Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal was viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project was available and that the project, when completed, would have a satisfactory level of public access.  The Local Authority is responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the facility.  I understand a joint venture company will be established between Balbriggan R.F.C and a private company to build and operate the pool.  The public interest will be safeguarded by a Deed of Covenant and Charge being put in place between the joint venture company, Fingal County Council and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, which would guarantee access to the public for an agreed number of hours at reasonable charges.Progress of pools under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme depends much on Local Authorities leading projects continuing to press ahead with construction on schedule and as indicated to the Department.  Once the grant is approved at Tender Report stage and construction commences, pools generally take about eighteen months to complete.  Before a grant is approved the Local Authority has to have a satisfactory funding package in place to ensure the project is completed.

The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.  In this regard, my Department has taken a direct role in relation to the provision of capital grant-aid for the arts and culture infrastructure throughout the country in recent years.Facilities funded to date include integrated arts centres, theatres, galleries, studio, and creative and performance spaces.  In this manner my Department provides the bulk of capital funding for building and refurbishing arts facilities around the country, mainly in the not for profit sector, while the Arts Council provides the ongoing revenue support for many of the facilities.  Under the first round of ACCESS, announced in 2001, funding of €43m was provided to the promoters of 40 arts and culture projects.  The majority of these projects were for the provision of new art centres and most are now open and operational.The NDP 2007-2013 provided €81m to conclude ACCESS 1 and to facilitate further rounds. In April 2007 a second round of ACCESS funding was announced and a total of €32m was offered to the promoters of 67 projects nationwide.  The primary focus of the second round of the scheme is the refurbishment and enhancement of existing arts and cultural facilities and it will run from 2007 to 2009.  In May 2008 a further 13 projects were allocated  €10.2m  in funding under the ACCESS II scheme bringing the total allocations under ACCESS II to €42m.  Given the current economic climate it is not possible to say when further funding schemes will be announced in respect of Arts Capital projects during 2009.

Under Section 7 (2) of the Act, the Authority is required to seek my consent together with the consent of the Minister for Finance to the disposal of land or an interest in land but the conduct of negotiations is an administrative matter that is the sole responsibility of the Fáilte Ireland Authority.  I understand that Fáilte Ireland has been in discussions with Cork County Council since late 2007 in relation to the valuation of the lands in question. These negotiations are on going. However in order to expedite the matter, Fáilte Ireland is in the process of submitting the matter to arbitration for independent adjudication.

As indicated in that reply, the Scheme of Community Support for Older People was suspended on 7th April in order to afford my Department the opportunity to review its operation.  I met with representatives of organisations involved with issues affecting older people and I have agreed with them a process that will set the broad parameters for the review and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of it.  I am hopeful that the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid September. As indicated in the earlier reply, it is my intention to re-launch the scheme later in the year, once the review is completed.  All applications received up to the suspension of the Scheme will be processed and approved, as appropriate, in line with the current eligibility criteria.  In addition, it is important to note that the suspension of the Scheme in no way affects those who already have received a monitored alarm device.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Charities Act 2009 was signed into law on 28 February 2009 and provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a new Charities Regulatory Authority. This will entail the dissolution of the Office of the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland (CCDB), which currently employs 8 staff.My Department is working closely with the CCDB to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for the smooth transfer of its functions and staff to the new Authority at the appropriate time. Liaison between my Department and the Department of Finance will also continue, as required, in relation to that transfer and the establishment of the new Charities Regulatory Authority, taking into account the current recruitment moratorium in place for the public sector.As the Deputy is aware, a number of other steps will have to be taken before the new Authority can be established, including the establishment of an initial Register of Charities (which has taken of the order of 2 years in other similar jurisdictions). I can confirm, however, that the introduction of statutory regulation for charities remains Government policy and I am committed to delivering an integrated system of mandatory registration and proportionate regulation and supervision of the charities sector in Ireland at the earliest possible date.

The changes provide for:A reduction in qualifying period required for access to back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) from 2 years to 12 months provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.  This is in conjunction with a reduction in the period for which the BTWEA is payable from 4 years to 2 years, at 100% of existing social welfare entitlement in the first year and 75% in the second.Immediate access to a shorter BTWEA, to be called Short Term Enterprise Allowance, for someone who qualifies for Jobseeker's Benefit (with 104 contributions paid) or who qualifies for statutory redundancy.  It will be paid for the duration of the Jobseeker's Benefit claim entitlement.Allow persons who previously participated in the BTWEA scheme and exhausted their entitlement after completion of the scheme, to participate a second time after a period of at least 5 years has elapsed.These changes will come into effect from 1st May 2009.  The changes will not affect participants who are already on either strand of the back to work allowance at that date.  These changes significantly strengthen the support for jobseeker's wishing to move to self employment and in this context the employee strand of the back to work allowance has been closed to new applicants from the 1st May 2009.  Persons who qualified for the back to work employee strand prior to this date will continue to be paid their entitlements.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The recent Supplementary Budget provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8%. The weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent is also being increased from €18 to €24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009. While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there is now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.Other changes in the Supplementary Budget provide for new maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels. Rent supplement will also be restricted to individuals who have been an existing tenant for six months. Individuals forming new households must have been placed on a Local Authority housing list following a full housing needs assessment before they are eligible for rent supplement.Existing recipients of rent supplement will be advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords will be advised through advertising in the print media of the general reduction in rent supplement payments.The Department has already issued briefing to the community welfare service outlining the measures announced in the Budget which impact the rent supplement scheme. Guidelines on the operational arrangements for the new measures, due for implementation on 1 June 2009, will issue to the community welfare service within the next two weeks when all of the relevant legislative provisions are in place.The Department is also in discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the role of local authorities who are responsible for providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need and for carrying out a housing needs assessment for those seeking a rent supplement payment. The two Departments intend to coordinate the release of guidelines to the community welfare service and local authorities, as appropriate.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The Deputy will be aware that in the context of the current economic circumstances, it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure in order to restore order and stability in the public finances. This has involved reviewing all public expenditure programmes, including social welfare programmes, which at some €21.3 billion in 2009 form a substantial portion of overall public expenditure.In order to avoid cutting all the weekly social welfare payment rates while trying to keep the welfare budget at a level the State can afford it has been necessary to discontinue funding for the Christmas bonus that is usually paid to certain welfare recipients. The payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in 2009 would cost an estimated €223 million, the net savings to be achieved in the decision not to pay the Christmas bonus could not be effected by any other measure. This was the most difficult decision the Government had to make in framing the supplementary Budget.  While very difficult decisions have been taken in order to restore order and stability in the public finances, I have been successful in keeping expenditure control measures in the social welfare area to an absolute minimum and in ensuring that the most vulnerable in society have been protected from their effects.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Persons in receipt of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes. This means that where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution. Also, any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions.The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the home-maker's scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate, and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.People who qualify for payments such as carer's allowance or carer's benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions for the period they are receiving the payment. There are, of course, people caring who cannot benefit from these measures. The Green Paper on Pensions considered a number of issues related to the qualifying conditions for a social welfare contributory pension. A framework for future pensions policy is being developed and the issue of contribution conditions will be further addressed in that context.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	492	An unemployed person may qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance. Jobseeker's Benefit is based on a person's social insurance record and Jobseeker's Allowance is based on weekly means. A fundamental qualifying condition for the benefit is that a person must be available for full-time work. The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Artists are generally adjudged to be self-employed workers, liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%. They are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these people enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems. Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The Executive has advised that rent supplement was refused as total household income was deemed to be sufficient to meet the accommodation costs of the person concerned. He appealed against this decision to an Appeals Officer of the Executive but that appeal was unsuccessful. The person concerned was notified of the Appeals Officer's decision on 19 February 2009 and advised of a further right of appeal to the Chief Appeals Officer of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. No such appeal has been received to date.

The Executive has advised that a community welfare officer recently made a home visit to the person concerned to assess entitlement to rent supplement. The person concerned has been advised that rent supplement and arrears due from November 2008 will be paid at the end of May.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Rent Supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is a means tested payment and  the capital value of all property owned by an applicant whether or not there is an income derived from it, is assessed for the purposes of establishing entitlement to a payment.  Under Section 196(1)(b) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, "the weekly means of any person for the purpose of ascertaining his or her entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance shall be calculated in accordance with the Rules contained in Part 4 of Schedule 3" of the Act.  Under Part 4 of Schedule 3 the capital value of property, other than a person's own home, "which is invested or otherwise put to profitable use or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not invested or put to profitable use" is assessable as means.The Executive has advised that the person concerned has an interest in property which is jointly owned by him and his siblings. A verbal valuation of the property was recently provided by a sister of the person concerned. Following an assessment of his share of the property in question and additional income which the person concerned has, he has been assessed with means of €372 per week which is sufficient to meet his housing needs and so he is not entitled to rent supplement. However, the Executive has decided to pay rent supplement to the person concerned, as an exceptional measure, for a period of six months to give him an opportunity to realise his share of the property. The person concerned was advised of this decision by letter dated 8 May 2009 and of his right to appeal against the decision to an Appeals Officer of the Executive.

The Executive has advised that the person concerned appealed against a decision to refuse mortgage interest supplement to an Appeals Officer of the Executive. That Appeals Officer decided that the person concerned is not entitled to a supplement on the basis that the amount of mortgage interest payable by him exceeds such amount as is considered reasonable by the Executive to meet his residential and other needs. The person concerned lodged a further appeal to the Chief Appeals Officer of the Department of Social and Family Affairs on 26 February 2009. An oral hearing of the appeal is being arranged and the person concerned will be advised of the date of the hearing in due course.

These Directives relate to discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, religion, age, race and disability.The Social Welfare Act 2004 (No. 41 of 2004 enacted 17 December 2004)The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2005 (No. 4 of 2005 enacted 14 March 2005) Sections 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37 & 38 of the Act provided for the implementation of aspects of the EC Council Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (the IORPS directive).  This Directive provided a framework for the operation and supervision of occupational pension schemes and allowed IORPs established in one EU Member State to be sponsored by employers in another Member State and required a number of amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990.The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (No. 26 of 2005 enacted 27 November 2005)The Social Welfare Act 2005 (No. 30 of 2005 enacted 16 December 2005)The Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006 (No. 5 of 2006 enacted 24 March 2006)The Social Welfare Act 2006 (No. 36 of 2006 enacted 19 December 2006)The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 (No. 8 of 2007 enacted 30 March 2007)Section 36 of the Act amended the Pensions Act 1990 in relation to Trust Retirement Annuity Contracts to ensure compliance with the IORPS directive (Directive 2003/41/EC).The Social Welfare Act 2007 (No. 40 of 2007 enacted 20 December 2007)The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 (No. 2 of 2008 enacted 7 March 2008)The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 (No. 22 of 2008 enacted 17 December 2008)The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 (No. 17 of 2009 enacted 29 April 2009)
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	498	There are currently over 86,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 44% since the end of December 2007. The recent Supplementary Budget provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8%. The weekly minimum contribution payable towards rent is also being increased from €18 to €24 a week, with effect from 1 June 2009. While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.Data published by the CSO show that rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009. A leading property website recently reported that rents have fallen by almost 16% in the twelve months to March 2009 with 5% of the fall occurring since the start of 2009. It is essential that state support for tenants who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords. Other changes in the Supplementary Budget provide for new maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels.Existing recipients of rent supplement will be advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases. Landlords will be advised through advertising in the print media of the general reduction in rent supplement payments. In the current climate, where there is a large number of vacant rental properties, it is expected that people will be able to get accommodation at the appropriate rental level.Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case e.g. where homelessness might result due to the inability of a person to meet their rent payment. The Department is also in discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the role of local authorities who are responsible for providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Overall expenditure on child benefit grew from the equivalent of €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of these rates increases and the growth in the number of eligible children.The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years. However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to avoid excessive borrowing and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.It was in that context that the Minister for Finance announced in the Supplementary Budget the Government's intention to subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010.The Department, together with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, will be giving the matter careful consideration over the coming months.Furthermore, the Commission on Taxation is considering the issues underlying the possible taxation of child benefit.  The Commission's deliberations will inform the Government's final decision on how to proceed.  Officials of this Department, in their submission and their meeting with the Commission, set out their views on the issues involved in means testing or taxing child benefit.Since 1944, Child Benefit has been a key instrument in child income support policy with the main objectives of supporting families in the costs of rearing children and the alleviation of poverty.  I assure the House that a decision on how best to proceed will not be taken lightly by the Government.

She was requested to submit details of her own and her spouse's employment. She was subsequently asked for a P45 for herself and a P60 for 2008 for her spouse.As her spouse did not receive a P60 for 2008 from his employer and the cumulative earnings details are necessary for the means assessment of Carer's Allowance the case was referred to an Investigative Officer of this Department for means assessment and confirmation that all conditions necessary for receipt of the allowance are satisfied. On completion of the necessary investigations a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These Officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

There are no plans to reopen this course.The lands in question are no longer used for military purposes and arrangements are currently being made to dispose of the entire property.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 and 334 together.The closure of barracks and the consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the White Paper on Defence. The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training. It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security. The consolidation process is designed to facilitate higher training standards, while also freeing up under-utilised resources and personnel for operational duties.The development and increased capability of the modern Defence Forces, when taken together with the improved security situation along the border removed the rationale for having seven barracks/posts along the border and provided the opportunity for consolidation of units in a smaller number of locations.In framing the 2009 Budget, the Government, therefore, decided to reduce the number of army barracks to bring it more into line with operational requirements of the Defence Forces and to achieve economies of scale. Four border barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Lifford and Rockhill were closed under this consolidation plan.The Government has made no decision in relation to any other barracks nor, contrary to the media reports last week, are further closures under active consideration by the Minister or the Government at this time.  While the staff in my Department and the Defence Forces continually review Defence Forces requirements in relation to barracks, infrastructure and other military installations it is important that the most recent changes be given the opportunity to bed down.Approx 240 military personnel permanently occupy this post consisting of B Coy and Support Coy of the 12 INF BN and the Reserve and Military Police directorates.   No staff of the Department are based in Clonmel.In the period 2000 to 2008 an average of €390,000 per annum has been expended on maintenance and refurbishment works in Clonmel Barracks.

Members are free to determine their own level of participation in Reserve activities and may resign from the Reserve at any time.  Their service is provided entirely on a voluntary basis with no compulsion to attend.  Members of the Reserve undergo both paid and unpaid training.A gratuity is paid to members of the Reserve Defence Force as a measure of reimbursement on account of losses, expenses and disabilities incurred by them consequent on their obligations as members of the Reserve Defence Force.As part of the modernisation of the Reserve Defence Force, a new scheme for the payment of gratuities was introduced from 1 January 2008 following consultation and agreement with the relevant stakeholders including the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.The new scheme provides for phased increases to the gratuity subject to the satisfactory completion by the Reservists of specified minimum periods of training and to have served for the period of the Reserve-training year, which runs from the 1st November to the 31 of October.  Service in the Reserve commences on completion of the recruitment process, including medical testing and security clearance.The previous rates and the revised rates changes are outlined in the following table:RanksPrevious Rates (w.e.f. 01/01/06)Revised Rate for aggregate of 7 days paid training plus the completion of voluntary training after 1 years serviceRevised Rate for aggregate of 14 days paid training plus the completion of voluntary training after 2 years serviceRates Integrated Reserve Defence Force€€€€Senior Officer*295.704141,0352,070Officers195.113067651,530NCO’s155.442526301,260Privates114.21180450900*Officer of a Brigade RDF Staff or an Officer in Command of a Company, Battery or Squadron.Gratuities paid in 2007 amounted to €581,000 and gratuities paid in 2008 amounted to €1.222 million.  The projected spend for 2009 is €1.85 million.I am satisfied that the new scheme creates incentives to improve retention and attendance at training in the Reserve Defence Force and this represents an effective productivity return from the revised gratuity rates. This is important in the context of the ongoing modernisation and change agenda within the Reserve Defence Force.

These authorities are: Dublin City Council; Leitrim, Laois, Limerick, Meath, Sligo, South Dublin and Wexford County Councils; and Sligo Borough Council.  In addition, a number of other authorities have indicated their intent to submit proposals for the leasing arrangements in the coming weeks.In relation to the proposals received, given the ongoing nature of the contract negotiations, it would not be appropriate to give further details on either the costs or the specific locations of the projects at this stage. However, as stated in the reply to Question No. 2 of 7 May 2009, I expect that authorities should be able to secure leasing costs of at least 20% below market value. This reflects the element of risk, such as vacancies and management and maintenance responsibilities, being transferred to the housing authority.

The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.My Department has now commenced this review, which I hope will yield preliminary outcomes by autumn 2009. As part of this process, there will be wide consultation with relevant stakeholders, including with the PRTB itself and landlord and tenant representative organisations, and there will also be a period of public consultation.The Board, in fulfilment of its remit to advise on policy aspects and the general operation of the Residential Tenancies Act, has already submitted to my Department a number of suggestions for legislative improvements and it is hoped to address the most critical of these in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, with the remaining proposals being considered further in the context of the review.

My Department is in discussions in this regard with the Department of Finance, which has overall responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act and its extension to further bodies.  At this stage, it is intended that the matter will be progressed in the context of proposals to be brought forward by the Department of Finance for the extension of the Freedom of Information Acts to a number of additional public bodies.  I understand that consideration of this matter is at an advanced stage and I would hope that the Department of Finance will be in a position to bring forward proposals this year.Once approved, and an implementation date has been agreed, the formal extension of the Act to additional bodies can be given effect by Regulations.

The BER certificate rates the energy performance of the building on a scale from A to G with A-rated buildings being the most energy efficient and G the least efficient.  There is no minimum energy rating which a building must achieve but failure to obtain a BER Certificate when required by the Regulations is an offence, which may lead to a prosecution and a fine not exceeding €5,000.00.  The BER Certificate is accompanied by an advisory report outlining a number of improvements that might be made to improve the energy efficiency of the building but there is no obligation on the landlord to carry out any of the recommended improvements.The BER certificate and advisory report serve to enable prospective tenants to take the energy performance of a building into account when making decisions in relation to lettings and to compare in a standard format the energy performance of a range of buildings available to them.  In this way it is intended that the BER system will promote greater awareness of energy efficiency in the property market and encourage building owners to take cost effective steps to improve the energy rating, and hence the overall energy performance, of such buildings.

The findings of the White Young Green (WYG) reports have informed my proposals in respect of the future management of the former ISPAT site and these proposals are at present the subject of consultation with relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which has a current Government mandate to look at future re-development options for the site.The issue of a retaining sea wall or similar such barrier remains a key issue to be addressed in this context. Consideration of a suitable mechanism to be put in place for ongoing dialogue with local communities to ensure that their requirements can be considered by the Government is also being pursued.A small number of works have recently taken place on site. These mainly relate to normal care and maintenance including the demolition of some old huts near the main entrance to the site, the cleaning of a castor pit which was being used to store hazardous liquid waste and the disposal of small quantities of waste materials from the main industrial part of the site. Dust deposition and PM10 monitoring, which is carried out at two locations in the vicinity of the site and at a location in Cobh, is still ongoing.

The study will address how better to implement waste prevention and minimisation in the particular context of the emergence of new technologies for waste management, particularly those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste which can reduce the need for both incineration and landfill. The review may well indicate a continuing role for incineration in our future waste management strategy but I do not envisage it being on anything like the scale that was previously envisaged. I anticipate that the study will be completed by mid-2009 and published shortly thereafter. In the context of its recommendations I will bring any necessary policy and legislative proposals to Government.Any proposed imports of waste into the State for incineration are regulated under the EU Waste Shipments Regulation which has direct applicability in the member states.

I published the report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date for submissions of 26 June 2009.  The report is available on my Department's website and I have forwarded a copy to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government inviting its input into the consultation process that is currently underway to inform the development of proposals in this regard.

On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government have decided not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.    A process will now be put in place, including discussions with the supplier, to address the disposal of the electronic voting and counting equipment and termination of storage arrangements.My Department engaged consultants with valuation expertise in May 2007, following a competitive tendering process, to examine individual lease arrangements and to make recommendations as to termination of the leases where appropriate.  In May 2008, I accepted the recommendations made by the consultants and these recommendations are in the process of being implemented.  It is expected that, in certain instances, the termination of lease arrangements will give rise to buy-out costs and these will be dependent upon the outcome of negotiations. Work on the termination of local lease arrangements will now continue in the context of the decision taken to conclude the electronic voting and counting project.Based on information provided to my Department by Returning Officers, the total annual rental costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment for the various locations are set out in the following table, which also includes ownership details provided in respect of each premises.In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.  These were largely one-off expenses, and there are no ongoing rental costs.

Last month, my Department, following a review of the Serviced Land Initiative in light of developments in the economy at large, and in the housing market in particular during 2008, and having regard to the oversupply of housing in some areas, informed all local authorities that the Initiative was being discontinued.  All existing scheme approvals under the Initiative, for which contracts had not been signed or letters of intent had not issued, were withdrawn.However, local authorities were also informed that where they are of the opinion that the continuation of a scheme is necessary for the proper development of an area, it is open to the relevant authority to make a case to the Department by 29 May 2009 for the scheme to progress.  My Department will consider any case that Wexford County Council may make within the specified time limit in respect of this project.

Industry itself, however, will be the major party in deciding as to whether the paper mill project is taken forward.  Stakeholders have been advised that both jurisdictions will continue to assist.

Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2007 defines ‘market value' as meaning the price, which the unencumbered fee simple of the house would fetch if sold on the open market.  At present a local authority may reconsider its valuation of a property in light of an independent valuation obtained by the owner; however, it is not obliged to accept this valuation.In the context of disputed valuations, provision has been included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, to allow for the market value of a dwelling to be determined by an independent valuer nominated by the owner from a panel of suitably qualified persons, established by the housing authority.Any person who is not satisfied with a service or action of a local authority should in the first instance make a formal complaint to that authority. My Department has issued guidelines to local authorities regarding the establishment and operation of effective customer complaints systems. Complaints regarding the actions of a local authority may also be made to the Office of the Ombudsman.

These Reports are published on the Department's website (www.environ.ie).A detailed list, including the title of each Bill which was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently signed into law in respect of each of the years 2004 to 2008 and to date in 2009, is set out in the following tables.  In addition, the table indicates in each case whether the legislation was drafted in order to give effect to a directive from the European Union.TitleDescriptionDrafted or Passed to give effect to EU Directive Yes/No?European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Act 2004Implements the recommendations of the Constituency Commission Report 2003 on changes to the European Parliament constituencies and gives effect to Council decisions of 25 June and 23 September 2002 concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament.NoElectoral (Amendment) Act 2004Provides in primary legislation (rather than by way of Ministerial Orders as envisaged under section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001) for the conduct of European Parliament, local and presidential elections and referendums using voting machines and electronic vote counting.

Main provisions include: a new dispute resolution service through a Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) instead of the Courts; a national tenancy registration system through the PRTB; rent determination by the PRTB; statutory rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, including improved security of tenure through a system of 4-year tenancy cycles; new tenancy termination procedures, including longer notice periods linked to length of tenancy; voluntary renunciation of the right to long-occupation equity leases; higher penalties for offences relating to standards and registration of private rented accommodation.NoTribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments Act 2004Underpins the discretion given to the Tribunal in its amended terms of reference as to which issues it should investigate or bring to public hearing.NoHousing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004Extends the control on the resale of certain dwellings and land. It allows the local/planning authority to place the claw-back as a charge on an affordable housing property.  Previously, the charge was placed on the local authority loan.  Allows private financial institutions access to the affordable housing mortgage market and facilitates the direct sale of affordable housing units to eligible persons nominated by the local authority.NoTitleDescriptionDrafted or Passed to give effect to EU DirectiveYes/No?Electoral (Amendment) Act 2005Provides for the number of members of Dáil Éireann and for the revision of constituencies, to amend the law relating to the election of such members and to amend the Electoral Act.NoTitleDescriptionDrafted or Passed to give effect to EU Directive Yes/No?Building Societies (Amendment) Act 2006Extends certain provisions of the Building Societies Act 1989 in relation to the demutualisation of the building societies and updates certain other provisions of the legislation.

This includes the granting of waste licences or waste permits for which the EPA or the local authority is responsible, and the enforcement of conditions attached to such licences or permits.Furthermore, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, advised the House on 29 April 2009 that food recycling companies in Ireland which recycle unused food as animal feed continue to be registered by his Department as Feed Business Operators under EU Regulation 183/2005 on Feed Hygiene. As part of ongoing risk assessment, that Department has already taken additional measures to enhance the inspections regime of feed manufacturing, grain drying, and food recycling premises with a view to minimising the risk of similar incidents.

This licence did not authorise any person to enter on any land without the permission of the owner or the occupier and, in addition, contained a number of conditions addressing the control of the Hunt, traffic management, the convenience of the general public and notification of landowners in the immediate vicinity of each hunt meeting.My Department is aware of some complaints in relation to some of the hunts which took place in the 2008/2009 season.  In considering any application for a renewal of a licence for the coming season, compliance with the licence conditions during the term of the previous licence will be taken into account.

A Ministerial Direction under Sections 18A, 19(4) and 20(3) of the Fisheries Act 1980, required the Central and regional fisheries boards to prepare and implement a programme for rehabilitation of salmon stocks, giving priority to rivers below their conservation limits; in special areas of conservation; and which have the greatest prospect of recovery; funded by the proceeds of the salmon conservation component of the salmon licence fees.  This component represents 50% of the licence fee.I understand that funds collected from this component of the sale of salmon licences in 2007, amounting to €513,000, were allocated to projects in 2008 based on agreed selection criteria.  Works undertaken included catchment-wide electro-fishing, river bank protection, spawning grounds rehabilitation, in-stream works and habitat restoration, smolt rescue programmes etc.Similarly, I am advised that funds collected from the sale of salmon licences in 2008, amounting to €898,085, have been allocated to projects in 2009.  Details of the projects undertaken are published in the annual report and the website of the Central and regional fisheries boards.  The full cost of an annual salmon angling licence for 2009 is €134, the same as in 2008.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 62% of Irish households and 83% of Irish SMEs now have a broadband connection.  According to ComReg's Q4 Key Data Report 68% of business subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2-10 Mbps range.  60% of residential subscriptions in Ireland are in the 2-10Mbps range while 35% are in the 1-2 Mbps range.Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  For example, speeds of up to 24Mbps are available from DSL providers, 50Mbps products are available from fibre operators and 20Mbps products are available from cable operators.The latest OECD report, which includes data up to June 2008, is testament to the considerable improvement of recent years.  It shows that Ireland had the fourth strongest per capita broadband subscription growth of the 30 countries ranked.  With similar fast uptake of broadband noted in previous reports, Ireland has closed the gap on the OECD average with our improvement over the past 2 years.  Additionally, it should be noted that mobile broadband, which is very popular with Irish broadband subscribers, is not yet published for the purposes of international statistical comparisons.  However, mobile broadband statistics are expected to be published by the OECD in the future reports.  The publication of mobile broadband statistics is expected to improve Ireland's ranking further.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector cannot justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, my Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Rollout of services commenced in April 2009 and the entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.Additionally, a consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which was launched for public consultation last year, considered the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks and set out the Government's commitments in that regard.  A central commitment is that there will be universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.

The evolution to next generation networks will be driven primarily by the private sector, operating in a fully liberalised market.As Minister for Communications, my role is to provide the policy framework that will facilitate the provision by operators in the sector of high quality infrastructure and services that will contribute to the development of a competitive knowledge society.  This framework is based on the principles of service and technology neutrality and open access.The following extract from ComReg's most recent quarterly report for Q4 of 2008 shows the position at that time regarding the provision of broadband over the various platforms. ComReg's published data as of Q4 2008At the end of December 2008, there were 1,200,255 broadband subscriptions in Ireland.  This represents a growth rate of 6.7% in the number of subscriptions for this quarter. Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) subscriptions, which had declined over the last couple of quarters, increased slightly by 0.6% in Q4 2008.  Annual growth for FWA subscriptions is flat.Mobile broadband showed the highest growth of all platforms this quarter, growing by 15% in Q4 2008.  Between Q4 2007 and Q4 2008 mobile broadband subscriptions have increased by 142% while total broadband subscriptions grew by 35.4%.PlatformQ4 ’08 SubsQuarterly Year-on-Year Growth Q3 ’08 – Q4 ’08Quarterly Year-on-Year Growth Q4 ’07 – Q4 ’08DSL660,025+4%+25%Cable104,133+9%+20%FWA118,497+1%0%Other8,691-9%+5%Sub-Total891,346+4%+18%Mobile Broadband308,909+15%+142%Total1,200,255+7%+35%1 ComReg notes that the data provided in this section relates to active subscriptions reported by operators.

Phase I of this Programme has so far delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.  Under Phase II of the MANs Programme 59 of 60 MANs which provides open access networks to 65 towns across the country are now complete.  It is expected that the final network of the Phase II Programme will be completed in early 2010. These networks allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at providing broadband to smaller communities.However, despite Government and private investment in the provision of broadband infrastructure there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.   Accordingly, my Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Rollout of the services in certain areas commenced in April 2009.  The entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.My Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless.  The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.    In addition details of the areas to be covered by "3" under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.Additionally, a draft paper on Next Generation Broadband, which was launched for public consultation last year, considered the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks and set out the Government's commitments in that regard.  A central commitment is that there will be universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.  The final report will be published shortly and will set the strategic policy framework for investment in high speed broadband.

The amount of the aid available was based on the size of the quota involved.  The sugar processor concerned had to implement a restructuring plan including social commitments in respect of former employees and environmental commitments related to factory dismantling and site remediation.  At least 10% of the aid was reserved for former beet growers and specialized beet machinery growers.Following its decision to renounce its entire quota and close the sugar plant at Mallow, the company in question qualified for EU restructuring aid of €127m approximately under the relevant EU regulations and in accordance with a High Court ruling in the matter.  The aid was paid in two instalments, €43.6m in June 2007 and €83.4m in February 2008.This aid formed part of the overall EU sugar restructuring package which was worth a total of €353m to Irish beneficiaries.  The other elements, which benefited the former beet growers, were the diversification aid and additional diversification aid (together amounting to €44m), the compensation incorporated in the single payment (€123m over 7 years) and the retroactive payments of restructuring aid amounting to €41m.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	564	The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent was in 2002 and the next is formally scheduled for 2012.On 21 April 2009 The European Commission published a Green Paper on the latest reform of the CFP in order to launch a consultation with Member States and stakeholders and to initiate a broad public debate on the future CFP reform.  A summary of this consultation process will be published in 2010.  It will be followed by a legislative proposal to the Council and the European Parliament to be adopted in 2011, with a view to its entering into force in 2012. It is clear that every aspect of the CFP is up for review and will require detailed attention.An exchange of views on the Green Paper will be held at the next Agriculture and Fisheries Council on the 25-26 May 2009.The CFP review has been on the agenda at a number of formal and informal meetings with industry, most recently at the Sea Fisheries Consultative Council meeting on the 7th May. The Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) has indicated their intention to pursue a process to develop its position in the matter and I await the result of its deliberations. My Department will of course be engaging in a parallel process of consultations with all stakeholders including the FIF to inform Ireland's position on the review.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	565	My Department's contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday 14th April 2009. This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country.The State will continue to provide financial support for the collection of certain dead animals, notably bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No. 1774 of 2002. The basic legal requirement is that animals which die on farms must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.Burial of fallen animals is only permissible under licence in remote areas i.e. islands, and listed mountain/bogland areas. Farmers who wish to bury animals on-farm should apply to their local District Veterinary Office for a burial licence.With the ending of the Fallen Animals Scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme is now a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.Pricing for animals not covered by the new scheme is a matter for the market. Within the boundaries of legal requirements my department will facilitate the introduction of measures enabling reduction of costs in the rendering/collection system such as permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, facilitating cross border trade as well as considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process (such as sterilisation) and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	566	I announced earlier this year that unused funds available in 2009 from the Single Farm Payment National Reserve would be paid to hill sheep farmers in the form of an Uplands Sheep Payment. The amount in question is approximately €7 million in 2009.Under the final agreement on the Health Check of the CAP, Ireland will have access to additional funds of the order of €25 million annually from unspent CAP funds from 2010. In accordance with the requirements of the regulation these funds can be used to address specific economic disadvantages affecting farmers in the dairy, beef and veal, sheep and goat and rice sectors. My main priority in allocating these funds is to ensure that they are used in the most efficient and effective manner for the development of Irish agriculture.Having consulted widely with all stakeholders I am currently carefully examining all proposals received in respect of 2010 onwards and I hope to make an announcement in relation to the use of these funds in the coming weeks once the Commission has adopted its detailed rules.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The contractual relationship between retailers and suppliers is a matter in the first instance for the contracting parties themselves and not one in which governments can intervene.  However the Competition Acts do prohibit unfair practices and the Competition Authority established under these Acts has a statutory role in ensuring that markets including the retail sector operate freely.  If there is evidence of retailers engaging in prohibited practices, I would urge the Deputy to bring such evidence to the attention of the Competition Authority in order that it may be investigated fully.The Government has demonstrated its continued commitment to the development of the food sector.  A range of measures have been put in place in line with the strategy set out in the Agri-Vision 2015 Report.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	571	As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission is currently conducting a review of Disadvantaged Areas across the Community, having been mandated by the Council of Ministers to conduct the review. The object of the exercise is to establish an E.U.-wide system, which will allow comparisons between regions, on the basis of eight bio-physical criteria, rather than the socioeconomic criteria which were used when defining the current Disadvantaged Areas is designed.This is a very important issue for Ireland as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area. From an economic perspective the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions in Ireland.I can fully understand and appreciate the current proposal to move from the existing socioeconomic criteria for defining Disadvantaged Areas to a system of definition based on physical and climatic criteria. However, despite the significant progress made between officials of the Commission, the Joint Research Centre and my own Department in addressing the scope of the new criteria, there are still areas which need further attention in order to ensure that the new criteria may accurately reflect the reality of farming in Ireland.If, as seems to be the case, physical characteristics will be used to classify Disadvantaged Areas, the crucial one from our point of view is soil drainage, taking into account the impact of water logging. While the proposed criteria includes climate, it appears only to provide for the impact of drought on farming activities in the EU. In my view there is also need to provide for the climate in North Western Europe and the impact of heavy rainfall on soil moisture conditions and the adverse impact this has on farming activities for long periods of the year, resulting in the land being unsuitable for grazing or machinery traffic — what is referred to technically as trafficability.The other important criteria from Ireland's viewpoint are Soil and Slope. In common with most other Member States, currently there is insufficient information available to classify areas using the soil characteristics of texture/stoniness and rooting depth. The lack of detailed data across Member States is recognised by the Commission in this Communication and, as the Commission is already aware, a comprehensive soil classification survey is currently being undertaken in Ireland, following completion of which the required information will then be available.I have raised my concerns regarding the criteria at the Council of Ministers and have argued strongly for due recognition to be given to the restrictions which our climate places on farming activities for long periods of the year. My officials have had numerous meetings with Commission officials and, currently, a series of Working Groups involving all Member States, together with Commission officials and officials of the Joint Research Centre, under the chairmanship of the Czech Presidency, is ongoing.I remain committed to working closely with the Commission to progress work in this area in order that the necessary analysis is completed allowing appropriate proposals to be brought forward to Council.

This survey arose from the talks which led to the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement in 2008.  At that time it was agreed that the relevant parties would enter into discussions regarding the terms and conditions of school secretaries and caretakers.Following ratification of the Transitional Agreement by the Unions in November 2008, a forum was set up with the aim of establishing the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of school secretaries and caretakers.  The forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, and also comprises of the relevant School Management Bodies, and the relevant Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU).  The forum held its first meeting in December 2008.The forum determined that the best way to establish this factual position was by conducting a comprehensive survey.  This survey was then developed by my Department, in consultation with the other members of the forum.  As there are established terms and conditions for secretaries and caretakers employed in the Community & Comprehensive sector and the VEC sector, it was decided that the survey should only cover the primary and voluntary post-primary sectors.  This survey was then issued to all relevant schools on Monday, 20 April 2009.  I hope that this information is of assistance to the Deputy.

While parents may choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area, the scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to do so other than on the basis of transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport — where there are spare seats available on the bus.Given the description of the special educational needs provided by the Deputy in the question, the parents of the pupil may wish to discuss the case with the local Special Education Needs Organiser and subsequently liaise with the School Transport Section of my Department regarding eligibility.

Earlier this year I announced details of 25 projects to commence architectural planning in 2009.The project for the special was not included in this announcement. Therefore, it is unlikely that it will be progressed in 2009.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

Generally, where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is  responsible for acquiring such temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.Following analysis of costs in my Department, it is now practice to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. This should reduce the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.In 2008, an amount of €131,754 grant-aid was paid for rental of temporary accommodation at the school referred to by the Deputy.  This amount included the rental costs for an additional prefab which was installed for September 2008.  Since January 2009 my Department has paid €69,234 in rental costs for the school.A review of rental policy is ongoing which will, inter alia, cover an examination of the contract terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if local circumstances require it. The review will involve an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.

The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation measures that were announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils. The alleviation measures mean that these schools can qualify for up to 4 language support posts with the possibility of additional posts also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism.Schools can now apply to my Department in the normal way for language support posts. These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support. It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be approximately 1,500 language  support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.Additional supports are provided for children in primary schools who do not meet the qualifying criteria for the appointment of full-time teachers in the form of grant aids for the employment of part-time English language support teachers. 443 schools have benefited from this type of financial support in the current school year.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	604	Following is the statement:Annex F (1.3.2) Extra places at Third Level:The newly developed accelerated Level 6 certificate programmes and the part time transition programmes in the Institutes of Technology have been targeted  specifically at unemployed people. The Institutes have worked directly with local FÁS and Department of Social and Family Affairs offices both in terms of  marketing the courses and advising participants of their entitlements in relation to social welfare payments.  It is anticipated that in the order of 1,000 unemployed people will have completed these courses by July and it is hoped that a significant number of these students will be encouraged to progress to other higher education certificate or degree programmes in the Autumn. The scope to further develop these initiatives and to identify other appropriate responses by the third level institutions to address the  up-skilling needs of the unemployed is being examined by the Higher Education Labour Market Response Group which I have asked the HEA to establish and which will report to me by the end of June.It is expected that at least 2,000 unemployed people will be accommodated on full time third level courses starting this autumn. Overall applications through the CAO this year show an increase of 8.5% on last year while applications by mature students showed an increase of 19% on 2008.  These figures are likely to reflect the fact that a number of unemployed people have already applied for entry to third level courses commencing this Autumn.  On 2 July the CAO will publish details of its available place courses where places are likely to be available following the first round of CAO offers in August and a further opportunity will be available for people to apply for places on such courses from 18 August 2009.Annex F (1.3.5) Part-Time Third Level Education Places:1,500 part time third level places will be provided to enable persons who are unemployed to pursue third level certificate or degree programmes on a part time basis. Arrangements for the operation of this initiative are being finalised by officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with a view to implementation from September 2009. Further information on how to access these courses will be made available as soon as these arrangements are finalised. It is expected that information on the courses will also be made available to unemployed people though local FÁS and Department of  Social and Family Affairs Offices.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second-level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.  My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2009, the standard per capita grant was increased by €14 per pupil and now amounts to €345 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €8 per pupil in 2009 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €212 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €22 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €557 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per  capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €318,500. The corresponding figure in 2000 was approximately €147,300.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector, along with those in the VEC sector, are increased on a pro rata basis that corresponds to increases in the per capita grant paid to voluntary secondary schools. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  My Department has provided an estimated €18.4 million per annum in equalisation funding to date.These significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. I will consider how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the Programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.With regard to fee-paying schools, teachers' salaries in all fee-charging schools are paid by the State; this arrangement pre-dated the introduction of free education arrangements. In the absence of fee-paying schools and the enrolment of all pupils in the non-fee paying sector, there would be subsequent additional costs to the State, and teachers would still have to be paid.  In Budget 2009, the Government has, however, decided to make changes to how fee-charging schools should be treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are allocated. Teachers in fee-charging schools are now allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20 to one, which is a point higher than allocations in non fee-charging post-primary schools. Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.While education remains a priority for the Government, a fact emphasised by the increases in capitation grants as already outlined, it was necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas in Budget 2009. One such area is the transition year grant which was abolished with effect from 1 January 2009. Savings of approximately €2.55 million are expected to accrue as a result of its abolition.The Government acknowledges that savings in the public service pay bill must contribute to the overall strategy for correcting the major imbalances in the Exchequer finances. This is reflected in the recent Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium across the civil and public service with effect from 27th March, 2009.

The European Communities Acts 1972-2007 is the principal legal instrument through which Ministers make statutory Instruments to give effect to EU Directives on various matters.    In the education sector this has largely related to the transposition of Qualifications Directives. During the period 2004-2009 the Recognition of Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 139/2008)  were made to give effect to Council Directive Council Directive No. 2005/36/EEC of 7 September 2005, Council Directive No 2006/100/EC of 20 November 2006, Article 24 of Council Directive  2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004, and Article 27 of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004.

Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the General Allocation Model resources.It is not normal practice for my Department to receive progress reports in respect of individual pupils.  Nor would my Department expect to receive information on how specific schools deploy the resources under the General Allocation Model or information which would populate a database of children receiving support under this model and I do not intend to initiate such a policy.The key issue is that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a MGLD.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The position is that a number of amendments are currently being considered arising from a review of the Student Support Bill following the Second Stage debate and further consultations since publication. A number of legal issues have arisen in the course of preparation of the legislation which require further advice and clarification.A number of the amendments to the Student Support Bill are at the final stages of preparation and my Department is currently working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to finalise any outstanding matters. I hope to be in a position to have these amendments finalised shortly with a view to progressing to Committee Stage before the summer recess.As the Deputy is aware, the legislation will make provision for the transfer of sole responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector.  Given the current budgetary situation across the public sector, resources are not currently available to advance transition to the new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  In the circumstances, it will be necessary to continue with the existing schemes and administrative arrangements for a period post enactment of the legislation.While it is not possible to say definitively at this point when the transfer of the administration of all new applications to the VEC sector will take place, I can assure the Deputy that the situation is being kept under continuous review in the context of the availability of resources.  In this regard, I am anxious, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all of the existing schemes for the intervening period. A number of amendments arising from this are currently a priority for my Department.

The amounts reflect 100% of total rental cost for prefab units currently rented by these schools. (The Department pays 95% of this amount for schools with permanent recognition and 75% for those with temporary recognition).  It should be noted that the rental amounts reflect the accumulated costs for the rental of prefabs from the contract start date of each prefab unit to end December 2008. The information is not readily available on a year by year basis. School may have a number of prefabs with a range of contract start dates.The prefab purchase details for the schools in question reflect the accumulated cost over the 5 year period up to and including 2008 and are not readily available prior to this period.CountyRoll NoSchoolCumulative cost to Dept over 10 year period up to and including Dec. 2008Current Annual School Rent 100%€€Cavan61140KSt Leo’s

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	612	Following an analysis of costs in my Department, it is now the practice to purchase rather than rent temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. This will reduce the incidence of long term rental of prefabs. In July of 2008, I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years, and who are being given approval for grant aid, to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.While a number of the schools approved to purchase prefabs have not yet indicated to my Department if they intend to provide a permanent accommodation solution, it is expected that in the region of 60 schools will do so.  The level of funding in individual cases varies according to the needs of the schools but in all cases it is based on the amount that would have been expected to be expended on prefabricated accommodation. If the tender amount for the permanent accommodation happens to be lower, the grant aid would be adjusted accordingly.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I have indicated my intention to commence Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act in the near future. I have also indicated that the commencement of the section will provide for it to be regulated that a school may employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in exceptional circumstances.  I believe that the above proposed legislative arrangement reflects the situation facing schools today where it is not always possible, for a variety of reasons, to engage a registered teacher for substitution duty.  I intend that this proposed amendment will be facilitated under the Education (Patronage) Bill.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 451 together.With regard to the majority of agencies under the aegis of my Department excluding the Vocational Education Committees the guidelines that issued make clear that the moratorium provides that with effect from that date, no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, nor payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.In the case of the VECs the guidelines took the form of Circulars 0022/2009 and 0023/2009, a copy of which can be viewed on my Departments website.  As the Deputy is aware posts other than teacher and SNA posts in schools (including VEC schools), are comprehended by the moratorium.  Teacher and SNA posts will be governed by a ceiling that will be determined this Autumn and the allocation of teachers and SNAs resources to schools and VECs will be governed by this ceiling.  I can clarify that this arrangement applies to teachers or teacher equivalents that are directly providing tuition to pupils in schools, in special programmes or in an adult and further education settings.  A copy of each Circular follows for the Deputy's information.In the area of Higher Education an Employment Control Framework is currently being developed to provide for the application of the moratorium to third level institutions.   In the meantime higher education institutions have been asked to fill only essential academic and support posts subject to their not exceeding their current overall number of authorised posts. Vacancies in administrative posts generally may not be filled.Where a body, such as a VEC, considers that a post which has become vacant and is subject to the moratorium should be filled, the body in question may communicate its view to my Department.  If, having considered the request, my Department is also of the view that the vacancy should be filled, my Department will communicate and engage directly with the Department of Finance on the matter.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I have received correspondence on this issue, and I am prepared to meet a deputation of relevant interests to discuss the matter.  Officials of my Department will be in touch with the correspondents to arrange a meeting as soon as possible, probably in late May or early June.Dance is included in the strands in the Physical Education curriculum in primary and post primary schools. In addition, students may choose Dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA). The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of 4 credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the Dance component. The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to Post Leaving Certificate courses and from there to higher education.My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage, inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance learning. Within that context, investment in mainstreaming of dance education as a subject for points for the purpose of third level entry is not a priority at the current time.
