          </question>

            <p eId="para_2">This question looks for an update to be given to the House on the Minister of State's follow-up investigations into the closure of Clerys department store. I particular want to focus on section 224 of the Companies Act, which states directors must have regard to the interests of employees. I welcome the report the Minister of State commissioned from Kevin Duffy and Nessa Cahill, both of whom are very well skilled to do it. However, the deadline is not until 11 March. I do not know what is going to come of the report but the existing legislation might have provisions whereby these issues can be pursued.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">Elements of existing legislation are currently under scrutiny. As the Deputy will be aware in the context of the review, I commissioned the report which I presented to Cabinet in July. Reference was also made to section 599 in company law and we think this is still relevant and may yet be used to test the law in this case. Last week the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I announced a twin-track examination of protections in law for employees and unsecured creditors, particularly to ensure limited liability or restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees and unsecured creditors. We have appointed two experts to examine the legal protections for workers, particularly where operations and assets may be moved to separate legal entities as part of a restructuring. This examination will specifically look at situations where valuable assets in a company are separated from the operating entity, and how the position of employees can be better protected in such situations. The experts have been asked to report by 11 March 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> As part of the twin-track process, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, also requested the Company Law Review Group to examine legislation with a view to recommending ways company law could be amended to better safeguard employees and creditors. In addition, on the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in 2001, the existing functions of the Minister relating to the enforcement of the Companies Acts transferred to the director of corporate enforcement. These functions included the investigation of suspected offences under the Companies Acts and prosecuting detected breaches of the Acts. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no investigative function under the Companies Act, 2014. The liquidators of OCS Operations Limited, which was the firm operating Clerys, have confirmed that they have submitted a report in the past couple of weeks to the ODCE in accordance with their statutory duties. The director of corporate enforcement is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_5">I have written to the ODCE asking it to look at the whole scenario that unfolded, particularly relating to section 224. What happened was cowboy capitalism at its worst and, as outlined by "RTE Investigates" a few weeks ago, there was a high level of thought and investment in preparing it. While we delay with our response there is a danger it could happen again. We are in a bit of a lacuna because nobody knows where we will be on 11 March, except the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but what is going to happen then? Has the Minister of State had any engagement with the liquidators since they submitted their report? Have we any sense of Government taking an active interest in the specific case so as to avoid a repeat of what happened here?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">One of the first actions that was taken in the context of the Clerys liquidation was the undertaking of a review by me of the circumstances around it. We were all appalled at the treatment of the Clerys workers and concession holders. We were very focused on the need for the Department of Social Protection, as the main creditor who had to pay out of its insolvency fund for statutory entitlements as workers were left high and dry, to become members of the committee of inspection under the liquidation process. The Department of Social Protection has been working at a very senior level with the liquidators. It is still possible that, outside the process the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I initiated last week, we could look at the interface between employment law and company law and see how workers and creditors can be better protected. A review of certain aspects of company law as it applies to situations like this is possible via the Company Law Review Group and it is still open to a creditor, under section 599 of the Companies Act, to go after related assets of a company in circumstances such as these.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The liquidation has not been completed yet. I am aware from media reports that Deputy Calleary has written to the ODCE relating to certain aspects of the applications of company law to cases like this. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">To date the liquidation has cost the taxpayer over €2.5 million. Natrium or the previous holding company have not paid anything. This is money which could have been spent in many other places but people are running away with millions in their back pocket and substantial assets while 600 workers and concession holders, who are often forgotten, are left high and dry.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> This may be a question for the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Damien English, but watching the programme it struck me that, now that resources are becoming available again, we need to move back into in-company training and give support to companies for the upskilling of existing staff. Job demands are changing so much that people who may have been in a job for some years need to be given support and employers who want to upskill their staff need to be given assistance to bring skill levels up to where we are at in the current jobs market. I ask the Minister of State to look at Skillnets in the context of a new budget.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">I agree that the focus needs to change. The Skillnets programme is operated by a lot of our business representative organisations and I have seen some of the programmes sponsored by, for example, ISME, which work very well for SMEs right across the country in upskilling people who are in employment to make sure we have the appropriate skills for the job and career challenges of the future. There is no doubt that this is very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> However, I am satisfied that we have reached this point now with the Clerys situation, a situation that appalled all of us. The trade unions, for example, are satisfied that we have a comprehensive review of that intersection between employment law and company law to try to ensure, in so far as we can, that the occurrence of situations such as that is minimised in the future so other people across the country do not have to experience what was experienced by the Clerys workers. I also wish to pay tribute to the dignity of the Clerys workers and the way in which they went about their campaign to have a review of the law initiated to ensure such situations do not recur. They were not putting themselves first. They were treated in an appalling fashion and I pay tribute to the way they have conducted themselves over the last period of time during very difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">Every job that is created is good news, and we welcome the improved figures. However, we must examine the situation honestly. Ireland is still suffering from an unemployment crisis, with 81,000 people on job activation schemes, 106,000 people who are under-employed and 147,000 people having emigrated. If one looks at all of the figures, the truth is that the Government has not yet made a dent in the unemployment crisis in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">Deputy Tóibín fails to recognise what the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has confirmed on each occasion it has published statistics in this area. Unemployment, which peaked at 15.1%, is now down to 8.8% and is falling continuously. Under-employment has fallen by 33% in the last two years and is reducing rapidly. From the outset, our goal has been to shift an economy that became too reliant on the construction sector, which collapsed in a property bubble, by rebuilding it based on a solid foundation of sectors across all areas of enterprise based on innovation and exporting. That has been highly successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> There are 135,800 people back at work. In the first three quarters of last year 43,400 new jobs were created, which is well ahead of our ambitious target of 40,000 for the entire year. The rate of growth of employment in the Irish economy is 2.9% on an annual basis. That is far faster than the rate in any other European country. We are making progress but I am the first to recognise that we must make more progress in reducing further the rate of unemployment and the rate of migration and in seeing people returning to work in Ireland. The 2016 Action Plan for Jobs is focused on that. It is a decisive shift from the first phase, which was recovery from a crisis economy. We set a target of having 100,000 people back at work and we have comfortably exceeded that before the 2016 deadline. We are now entering a new phase where we have doubled the target by setting a target of 200,000 extra people back at work. This phase is all about implementing the medium-term plan that we set out in Enterprise 2025 and Innovation 2020. We have a strong record built on entrepreneurship, the regional enterprise plans and the innovation strategy. We will continue to work on delivering that.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">Let us look at the figures more closely. The Minister says 135,000 jobs have been created, but he takes the base year as 2012. The Government took office in 2011. In that period, supposedly 120,000 jobs have been created. In the same period of time, the number on activation courses has jumped from 50,000 to 80,000. Of the 120,000 is it safe to assume that 30,000 are activation jobs or schemes, in other words, not fully waged jobs? That brings the figure down to 90,000 in that period of time. The truth is that, thankfully, there are strong external tail-winds helping this country along at present. Quantitative easing, exchange rates, interest rates, oil prices and so forth are all helping this economy. However, the internal competitive advantages which the Government should be putting in place to ensure there is a sustainable economy into the future have not been put in place, unfortunately. The truth is that the singular competitive advantage that this Government seeks is a bargain basement corporation tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">The Deputy again refuses to recognise what every international publication has recognised - that Ireland has improved its competitive position consistently. Forbes magazine recently listed Ireland as the best place to do business in the world, at No. 1 globally. All of the various competition rankings show Ireland consistently improving its placing and, importantly, in areas that matter, such as skills, innovation and technology, where we have targeted improvements. The Deputy is correct that we cannot take recovery for granted and that there are international pressures which could change it. That is the reason our focus is relentlessly on building a strong enterprise base, strengthening our innovation and expanding the number of countries to which we export and the range of goods and services we export. That is what builds a robust base to be strong in the face of any changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The Deputy is simply wrong about activation schemes. Many of these schemes have nothing to do with the CSO's record of people at work. Some of them do, such as back-to-work enterprise. There has been an increase in the number of people who are setting up their own enterprises on returning from the social welfare code. That is to be welcomed. Overall, however, with regard to the number of extra people who might be on schemes, there are 8,500 more people on schemes than when we launched the Action Plan for Jobs. Over 93% of the jobs are real jobs in the private sector. The vast majority are full-time jobs with good conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">The waters are muddied to a certain extent with regard to these figures and much of the truth is hidden. However, if one adds the numbers of people who are under-employed, on activation schemes and have been forced to emigrate, the total amounts to approximately 334,000. If one then adds the number of people who are on the live register, one reaches a total of 662,000 people. Those 662,000 people are the collateral damage of this Government's economic policy with regard to jobs. That is a very large section of the population. It is approximately a quarter of the labour force in the State. I urge the Government, in the dying days of its term of office, to put down real competitive advantages. That means investing in roads and rail so people can move around the country or move products around it. It should invest in telecommunications and broadband, the transportation system and in education and health, which have been divested from massively by this Government. However, the Government's plan, according to the spring budget, is to reduce Government investment from 1.8% of GDP to 1.5%, which is the lowest rate in Europe. This Government's ambition is to have the lowest investment in Europe. It is considered that 4% is necessary just to maintain the capital stock from depreciation. How will we have competitive infrastructure in the State at that level of Government divestment?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">Concerns about exploitation of vulnerable migrant workers in this sector are global in nature. In order to address the complex array of issues facing the State in monitoring compliance with workplace legislation in the fishing industry, the Government established a task force on allegations regarding treatment of workers on Irish fishing trawlers, which was chaired by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney. Arising out of the conclusion of the task force’s work in November last, we have developed a scheme in Ireland to assist such workers. I welcome the agreement reached by members of the task force, which saw all Government and State agencies involved in the sector coming together to come up with a solution. This cross-departmental approach makes the scheme robust and fair, as well as helping to reduce the potential for migrant workers in this sector to be abused by unscrupulous employers. The new atypical employment scheme provides that non-EEA nationals will enter into a new employment relationship with an employer in the State, as opposed to being share fishermen, which has been the predominant model in the sector. As such, they will be guaranteed all appropriate employment rights and protections during their period of employment and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, will have a remit in respect of compliance with employment rights legislation and enforcing these workers’ rights. Enforcement of legislation relating to the rest periods and maximum working time of seafarers and fishing vessel crews will continue to be under the remit of the marine surveyors of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Health and Safety Authority as part of its broader national remit also undertakes inspections of fishing vessels as these are defined as workplaces under health and safety legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Complementary to the new scheme, the powers of the inspection service of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, have been broadened under the recently enacted Workplace Relations Act to empower WRC inspectors to board vessels to enforce the full suite of employment rights legislation for non-EEA workers who will be employees under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> An essential part of the follow-up to the introduction of the new scheme is the Government’s stated intention to see a memorandum of understanding put in place by relevant State enforcement bodies to provide a rigorous and effective cross-agency inspection system. A subgroup of the relevant enforcement agencies, which I have chaired, has worked intensively in recent weeks to agree the terms of the memorandum to be put in place before the commencement of the new scheme. The memorandum will underpin a robust system of risk-based inspections, based on information sharing and joint inspections where appropriate. I expect the memorandum to be in place shortly, in tandem with the new arrangements for non-EEA workers in the fishing industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I ask the Minister of State if the Government accepts - I quote from <i>The Guardian</i> - that African and Asian migrant workers were being routinely but illegally used as cheap labour on Irish fishing trawlers working out of some of the country's most popular tourist ports. If that is accepted - it is good that it accepts the facts - why did the Government not do something about it? Rather than just repeating our last engagement from a couple of months ago I want to ask some more questions on the permit scheme. Were any representations made by fishing employer organisations to increase the number of permits from 500 to a higher number? Also, would the Minister of State agree that it is quite problematic to have the permits tied in to an employer? It obviously restricts the freedom and the relative power of the worker in the circumstance relative to the employer and the fishing industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">The scheme will be operated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Where my interest lies is in terms of the operation of the National Minimum Wage Act. Under the scheme non-EEA workers, having gone through a system and a process in terms of a contract where a fishing vessel licence owner will have to go through a solicitor and a general contract is developed to govern the whole scheme, would be protected under employment legislation because there is a basic requirement to pay non-EEA workers the national minimum wage. Therefore, they come under the suite of employment rights legislation that applies to everybody in the State. That is a recognition of the need for the industry to change and the way in which migrant workers from non-EEA states are treated in the context of the Irish fishing industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">So there have been reports that fishing industry representatives have sought to increase the number of permits from 500 to 1,000. I do not know whether they have made representations to the relevant Minister. It seems to me that is in contradiction to the initial response to the fishing industry representatives which was to be extremely dismissive, a bit like the Government at that stage saying that this was not really happening and, therefore, it would not make sense to call for an increase in the number of permits. I wish to ask the Minister of State two questions which relate to workers' rights. I welcome the fact that they will be covered under employment legislation. First, will he agree that it is wrong for the permit to be tied to a particular employer as it makes it difficult for an employee to whistleblow on an employer, to speak out about their conditions, because of the threat that they will lose the permit and lose the right to stay in the country? Second, will he agree that all those who are in Ireland should be offered an amnesty in terms of migration in order to encourage people to speak out about their conditions?</p>

We acted very quickly to put the new system in place. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I acted very quickly to put the new system in place to deal with this very difficult situation. It is useful to take a step back and consider what type of changes will be introduced. We have a new atypical work scheme which is to be put in place for non-EEA workers for the first time. The scheme will provide that during the first three months after its commencement, permissions will be limited to those non-EEA workers already operating on Irish fishing vessels. That is an opportunity for those who are here at the moment to regularise their situation. Cross-sectoral pre-clearance systems ensuring a comprehensive, legally binding contract of employment will be put in place. Anybody who has concerns about how they are treated in the workplace has the same protections as everybody else in this country in terms of making complaints through the usual channels-----</p>

            <p eId="para_40">This week we launched the fifth Action Plan for Jobs. A key objective of the Action Plan for Jobs process has been to rebuild our economy based on enterprise and entrepreneurship, talent, innovation and exports and provide a solid foundation for future growth. The action plan is a to-do list for the economy - a to-do list for the whole of Government. Most importantly it publicly commits to exact timetables for delivery with the Department of the Taoiseach together with my Department overseeing and driving implementation and publishing a delivery record each quarter for all to see. It is because of these structures and this approach that the OECD in its review of the APJ in 2014 said it: "marks an important innovation in Irish governance." When we launched the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, we set ourselves the target of creating 100,000 extra jobs by 2016, which we surpassed a year and a half ahead of schedule. Therefore, when we launched the 2015 action plan last January, we set a new target to have 2.1 million people in employment by 2018. That target has not changed and is one of the five strategic ambitions we have committed to in the 2016 plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> In November 2015, we published Enterprise 2025, the ten-year jobs and enterprise strategy which provides the roadmap to build a sustainable economy and have 2.18 million people at work by 2020, an additional 80,000. This would mean more people at work than at any time in the history of the State. We now have the ambition of bringing home 70,000 of the emigrants who were forced to leave due to the crash caused by the policies pursued by the last Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> The Action Plan for Jobs complements the Government’s Pathways to Work which sets out actions to be taken in support of those who are currently unemployed to help them access the labour market and new job opportunities. Last week, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection published the new Pathways to Work strategy for the period to 2020. Our Departments will continue to build on the progress to date through the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work to ensure that more employment opportunities are available to those who are seeking work and, therefore, reducing unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">Why is it that in other economies, such as Germany's, 4.5% is regarded as full employment whereas we are going for the higher rate?</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The Minister has not outlined the reason for the change or why the targets are being pushed back. The Department of Finance indicated in October that we would not achieve a 6.4% rate in 2020 or a 6.2% rate in 2021. The Minister can talk about action plans for jobs and targets and everything the OECD says but this represents a serious shift in the goalposts.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> It is true that emigration happened. The amount of emigration that happened is equivalent to another 6% on top of the unemployment rate. Even bringing those people back and giving them the opportunity to come back into employment does not account for the shift in the goalposts that has occurred.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">The Deputy should understand that what we can influence is the number of jobs that are created. That is the central target we have always set ourselves. It was a target of 100,000 and it is now a 200,000 target. Obviously, projecting the impact that has on the number of unemployed will depend on a number of factors that are less easy for a government to predict exactly because they include the flow of inward and outward migration, a natural increase in the labour force and so on. Essentially, we are predicting and building our targets around a growth of 10% in the total number at work. We envisage that a significant part of that will impact on those who are out of work and that has been the record in recent years. That ten points will be spread between reducing the 8.8% rate below 6% as well as accommodating 70,000 people who we now believe can be attracted to come home.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> We have not changed the job targets in any way but I suppose we are being a little more conservative in terms of when the 6% rate will be reached. That is part of official forecasting.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> I remind the Deputy that when I launched the Action Plan for Jobs and forecasted 100,000 extra jobs, the Department of Finance forecasted that unemployment this year would be 11.6%. We have comfortably beaten that because of the ambition we have set and the implementation that we have delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I welcome that the Minister's ambition is better than that of the Department of Finance. However, can the Minister explain why he is focusing on 6% versus 4.5% in Germany? As Deputy Tóibín has said, the reality is that we still have 88,000 people on activation schemes. We still have another 100,000 part-time workers who are seeking full-time employment and who are in receipt of a payment. We have many people abroad but if they were here, they would be part of that figure. The Minister has dismissed the activation schemes somewhat as not forming part of the jobs plan but most of those 88,000 people are looking for full-time employment. If they are not feeding in to the labour market or providing opportunities for the labour market, then it is an issue the Tánaiste needs to address. As long as the Government continues to exclude them from the overall figures, there is something seriously flawed with our unemployment model.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">Let us consider the Irish economy other than in the period when it was overheating. Full employment was in the range of 5% to 6%. That is where we aim to get to by 2020. However, one of our key ambitions is that it will be a sustainable level of full employment and that the economy will not be subject to the buffeting that happened when we were reliant on the construction sector to get to those low rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> We want to build a strong economy. The Minister for Social Protection set out a number of successful programmes that have delivered more people from the unemployment numbers. Let us consider the fall in the unemployment rate. It has consistently outperformed forecasts because we have been successful in getting people from the live register onto work schemes. In 2015, the year gone by, 135,000 people left the live register to take up work. That is a strong performance. As a proportion of those unemployed, that is the highest in five years, with some 42% leaving the live register to take up work. Strategies such as Pathways to Work are impacting on the live register and we aim to continue and improve them.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">Will the Minister set out his views on the findings of the report of the University of Limerick and the study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts? The study confirms the precarious nature of work in this economy. It confirms that the labour market has become increasingly flexible through the use not of zero-hour contracts in particular, but of if-and-when contracts. What is the Government going to do to ensure that the jobs being created are decent jobs such that people can provide decent living standards for themselves and their families?</p>

            <p eId="para_55">The statement of Government priorities in July 2014 committed to conducting a study on the prevalence of zero-hour contracts among Irish employers and their impact on employees and making policy recommendations to Government on foot of the study. Following a competitive tendering process, a team from the University of Limerick was appointed in February 2015 to carry out a study into the prevalence of zero-hour contracts and low-hour contracts in the Irish economy and their impact on employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The study, published in November last year, found that zero-hour contracts, as defined within current Irish employment rights legislation, are not extensively used in Ireland. It found low working hours can arise in different forms in employment contracts, such as regular part-time contracts with fixed hours or a contract with if-and-when hours only or a hybrid of the two. If-and-when contracts are contracts where workers are not contractually required to make themselves available for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The UL report made a range of recommendations relating to contracts, hours of work and notice, minimum hours, how contracted hours should be determined, collective agreements, data gathering and wider contextual issues. The UL study was an independent study and the conclusions drawn and the recommendations made are those of UL. Therefore, it was essential for the various stakeholders who contributed to the study, and any other interested parties who may not have had an opportunity to discuss their views with the University of Limerick during the data gathering period to be given an opportunity to consider and respond to the report. To this end, I sought submissions from interested parties by way of a public consultation. That process concluded on 4 January 2016. That was the closing date for the receipt of submissions. As Deputies can imagine, the responses contain a variety of views both for and against the findings and recommendations made by the University of Limerick. They will require careful consideration by my Department over the coming period. This will inform the policy response to be considered by Government arising from the study.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> As I said at the committee yesterday, it is my intention, as per the Government agreement in November, to bring forward proposals to Government colleagues in the coming period.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">Does the Minister accept that the prevalence of if-and-when contracts and precarious work gives the lie to the idea of a strong recovery and good quality jobs being created? Given that 32% of workers are working fewer than 35 hours per week, 24% of workers work different hours each week and 41% of workers work part-time because they cannot find full-time work, compared to less than 30% across the European Union, it is clear we have a worrying drive towards increasing labour market flexibility. This comes at the expense of workers' security and workers knowing what is happening next week and being able to access mortgages, etc. In reality, we have vicious exploitation of workers, in particular, workers in certain sectors, such as retail, and women. This issue is distinctly gendered.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> What is the Government going to do about it? Which of the recommendations - I agree that they are good - is the Government going to accept and try to legislate for?</p>

            <p eId="para_61">I know that Deputy Murphy has a particular worldview. Regardless of what the CSO might say about the increase in full-time work, the increase in employment generally and the falling numbers of those in underemployment, all of which are welcome, he would always beg to differ with the view of the CSO and the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> There is of course a challenge for the economy, the Government and employers to ensure that the jobs we are creating are good decent sustainable jobs that reward people appropriately and have strong terms and conditions. We have introduced a suite of reforms in the industrial relations landscape and in employment rights. This has been done by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and by me in recent years. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced legislation to replace the joint labour committee system which fell in the courts some years ago. In October, I signed into law employment regulation orders applying to the contract cleaning and security industries. These brought forward in law new minimum rates of pay for those working in those industries. It has resulted in 55,000 people with better protection and terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> When we analyse the performance of the economy and the type of jobs that are being created, we should not necessarily look at one area in particular. The broad range of employment protection legislation, the increases to the minimum wage and new arrangements are all positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">My particular worldview is one that would have been shared by the Labour Party not long ago. It is the idea that no one who is in work should be living in poverty. We should not be the second highest country in the OECD in terms of prevalence of low pay. We should not have 20% of workers living in deprivation. I do not think that is such a radical worldview.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">What will the Government do about this?</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> A key point made in the report was on the rising cost to the State of income supports. The State is subsidising low-pay, precarious employers through the likes of the family income supplement, FIS. Will the Government take action to eliminate what are largely the equivalent of zero-hour contracts and introduce banded-hour contracts and guaranteed-hour contracts so that people might know what hours they must work, plan accordingly and have enough money on which to survive?</p>

            <p eId="para_67">We are considering the proposals. It is important to ensure that employers have a degree of flexibility in the labour market, but not to the point where anyone is allowed to be exploited or abused by unscrupulous employers. We undertook this study because we were conscious of that. We wanted to get a handle on the nature and extent of low-hour contracts and the survey has made a useful contribution to that debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> Ours is the first Government that has taken a keen interest in this matter and it is our view that we should be tackling some of the more egregious aspects of these practices in order to end abuse. We are considering a suite of proposals made by the University of Limerick, but the Government has not formed a view on how to progress them yet. I have views on that front, however, and I want to do everything that I can to ensure that the interests of low-paid workers and people in precarious work situations are protected and their circumstances are enhanced. All of the measures that I have taken on this matter since being appointed Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment have fed into that process and been successful.</p>

Does it not speak to the nature of the recovery as being for big business and the rich when workers continue to face job losses and major exploitation?</p>

            <p eId="para_71">There will always be companies that lose employment. It is a source of disappointment whenever that happens, but the rate of job losses in Enterprise Ireland and IDA companies is at an historical low. This is encouraging. There is strong employment growth, including in manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> It is a source of great disappointment that Cadbury has needed to indicate that it will reduce the numbers it employs and restructure its business. In February 2015, the company announced job losses and stated that its Dublin facility would focus on four of its key brands. However, it committed to an investment of €11.7 million to improve the technology at the plant and copper-fasten its quality and capacity to compete in the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> I met the company as recently as last November and Enterprise Ireland continues to work with it to ensure that the best outcome is secured. We have a cross-agency group that is designed to help the workers in every way that we can. My understanding is that the company has not made changes to the plans announced in February. However, it continues to engage with the unions on the restructuring and has been negotiating on future work practices. It has availed of the State's industrial relations machinery, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. I understand that the recommendations of the Labour Court are to be considered by union members this month.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">That the jobs are disappearing and the workers are disappointed are not just natural events. It is cold comfort to the 17 workers who may lose their jobs that the rate of job losses elsewhere has decreased. Does the Minister acknowledge that the reason these jobs will go is not that Mondelez or the Cadbury plant in Coolock is unprofitable, but because Mondelez wants to maximise its profits? Mondelez's income in 2014 was $34.2 billion and now it is chasing further profits on the back of a race to the bottom in working conditions, pay and the yellow-packing of jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Does the Minister agree that the workers should be supported in taking action against the company and demanding that no further outsourcing should occur, given in particular the investment announced and promises made last year?</p>

            <p eId="para_76">In any company based in Ireland that has an international footprint, its Irish operation must be competitive with its other operations. This means that companies continually go through processes of restructuring. Enterprise Ireland seeks to support companies in doing that in order to anticipate threats that might be posed. Protecting companies and employment forms a large part of Enterprise Ireland's work. We have reduced the job loss rate to its lowest ever at just 4%. Sadly, however, there are still cases in which employment is lost.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> We seek to ensure that companies remain competitive in the long term. That is the common aim in this instance. The company has committed to an investment programme, but it must negotiate with its unions those work practices that it believes will prove important in ensuring its long-term future. We seek to assist that process through the WRC and the Labour Court with a view to a fair and equitable outcome for everyone concerned. This is the approach that has been taken by every Government. We support the best possible outcome for workers in this situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">At least that answer has the benefit of being honest: "That is capitalism". Companies will try to maximise profits, globalisation means that there will be an international race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions and we must go along with it. The workers would not be happy to hear the news that this is the Government's approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> To become the most competitive, the company will want the most flexible workforce possible, to outsource as much as possible and to pay as little in wages as it can. Should the workers and the Government accept this? The public good in having these jobs in Coolock is immense. The Government has a responsibility to defend them on the basis of decent terms and conditions and to support workers in resisting attacks on wages, conditions and jobs, not to accept the logic of a race to the bottom.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">The Deputy is seeking to distort what I stated. Through Enterprise Ireland, the Government seeks to work with companies to secure quality jobs that will survive in the long term and provide increased living standards for people. Consider the evidence of recent years since the recovery took hold. The number in employment has increased, wages have increased, the Government has been in a position to cut the tax burden and other burdens on workers, the legislation on temporary agency workers has improved, registered employment agreements, REAs, and employment regulation orders, EROs, have been restored and the Low Pay Commission delivered an increase in the national minimum wage. This work is continuing, but we must see a strong and viable enterprise sector that can grow employment and living standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> Unfortunately, there are times when companies must undertake restructuring. We aim to support this restructuring to get the best possible outcome in the long term, that is, a good plant that will offer good and secure employment. The company must negotiate with its unions, however, and that is happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">The Low Pay Commission was established last year through the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015. Its remit is to make recommendations to me regarding the national minimum hourly rate of pay, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair and sustainable and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.

Does the Minister of State agree that the prevalence of low pay among women and young people speaks against it being in any way an equal recovery or a recovery for ordinary people? Does the Government and the Labour Party, in particular, consider it to be a source of embarrassment that two thirds of low-paid workers are women, that 50% of women earn less than €20,000 per year and that the highest levels of growth in precarious work are in areas dominated by female workers such as the retail sector? The incidence of low pay among the under-30s is around 40%, on average, while teenagers receive 70% of the adult minimum wage rate.

            <p eId="para_87">The reason I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine these areas in the first place was that we wanted to make sure there was full, active participation in the workforce and that people were treated appropriately. The commission's figures revealed that about two thirds of those on the national minimum wage were women. We want to look under the bonnet to see why that is the case. For example, as a Government, we want to ensure full participation in the workforce by all sections of society. There are underlying reasons for the preponderance of women in certain sectors of the economy. There are issues to do with access to child care, caring duties and responsibilities, the bulk of which, whether we like it, are still taken on by women. We want to address these issues. That is why we, as a Government, are addressing issues to do with child care and want to introduce better child care facilities for families to encourage more people to participate in the workforce. I am looking forward to receiving the reports. I asked the Low Pay Commission specifically to examine these two areas because they are of interest to me in terms of the widest possible participation in the workforce.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">Does the Minister of State agree that we live in a low-wage economy? Was it the Government's intention to create a low-wage economy, where 20% of workers would be classified as living in deprivation, where one third of one-income households would be deprived, where many people affected by the housing crisis and suffering from homelessness would be employed and yet could not afford appropriate accommodation or shelter? The low-wage economy hits young people and women the hardest. Further investigation will reveal that child care responsibilities are an important aspect of the reason women are pushed into lower paid and less secure, more precarious sectors of employment. What is the Government actually going to do about this, as opposed to Labour Party election promises? The party has been in government for five years. Is there not a need for publicly funded child care provision that is free at the point of use? Does the Government agree that what we need is a minimum wage that is at least a living wage, as that would make a significant difference to the lives of about one in four workers?</p>

            <p eId="para_91">The Deputy is quite good at identifying some of the problems, but he does not take a solutions-based approach to the economic and social challenges. That is unfortunate, but we do and we have had some success in doing so. I do not agree with his depiction of the economy as a low-wage economy in general. The evidence does not suggest it is. Living standards are improving; the level of disposable income is improving, as are wage levels across the economy. We are playing our role in improving wage levels across the economy, through an increase in the national minimum wage from 1 January this year which will apply to about 124,000 workers. That is a very significant contribution, with, as I mentioned, the signing of employment regulation orders which apply to 55,000 workers in contract cleaning and security services. We are legislating and regulating to make sure the least well-off in society, those who work hard, will see an uplift in their living standards. We are doing what we can from a legislative point of view to make sure that will be the case and the economic recovery will hit not just every region in the country but every household. That is our job.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">As Minister in the Department with primary responsibility for the promotion of a competitive environment that supports and promotes job creation, my Department and I are acutely aware of the enormous value of work experience in assisting jobseekers in finding employment. Since the inception of the JobBridge national internship scheme, my Department has been a willing participant and sought to maximise the opportunities available to jobseekers. Since 2011, when the scheme began, 25 placements have been offered by my Department, of which 13 have been taken up. Of these, six left within the proposed internship period - five to take up employment elsewhere and one for unspecified reasons - while five successfully completed their internship before moving on to other endeavours. There are two JobBridge interns assigned to my Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_97"> I emphasise for the Deputy that internships do not displace existing staff and are not used to fill vacant posts. My Department’s HR unit has been very careful to structure internships in such a way as to ensure interns receive quality training and experience that maximises their opportunity to find employment subsequently. The intern placements offered to date by my Department have been in areas such as company law and legal research, intellectual property and copyright report research, records management and entrepreneurship strategy projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> On the question of JobBridge participants subsequently being offered employment in my Department, recruitment to all Departments is conducted openly and transparently via the Public Appointments Service and open to all suitably qualified applicants, as determined by the recruitment process. Directly retaining interns in my Department was, therefore, not an option. I am, however, confident that the experience they gained while in my Department was of significant benefit to them as they sought to progress their careers.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">As the Minister did not really provide the figure in the very clear way I would like, I will spell out what I think the answer was. I asked how many placements had been provided and the answer was 13. A total of 25 placements were offered, of which 13 were taken up. I asked how many of them were subsequently offered full-time employment. If I did not take up the Minister wrong, the answer is zero. He obtained interns to work for the Department for nine months - I am sure they received valuable experience, etc. - and then did not employ them. This is the Department that is meant to be dealing with job creation. It highlights what is happening with the JobBridge scheme in that interns are being used to do work to make up for the recruitment embargo. They are also being used to legitimise the idea of people working for free and thus counteract the idea that there is actual job creation. That is the Government leading the way and the solutions-focused approach which sends a message to the private sector that if a company wants somebody to work for free, there is a great scheme called JobBridge in place, whereby the State will subsidise the company to have somebody come to work for free and the company will not have to employ them. I do not see how this helps in dealing with the unemployment crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">It has long been established that a catch-22 for people seeking to enter the labour force is that they do not have experience. The purpose of the JobBridge programme is to bridge that gap. The Department of Social Protection, to which the Deputy should, perhaps, direct his questions, has very clear requirements in respect of the training provided and the value of the experience gained. That is what we have done. As made clear in the answer, nearly 50% of interns went directly from a JobBridge scheme placement into employment; therefore, the experience gained did help them to find employment. Obviously, the others have moved on and no doubt many of them have found work. The public service recruitment process remains open and transparent, as I outlined. I thought the Deputy would see it as valid, to allow all qualified persons to compete for posts in the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">As the Deputy knows, there have not been many opportunities for recruitment in the public service but now, as a result of the progress we are making elsewhere in the economy, we are in a position to recruit, particularly in areas on the front line, such as health and education, which is welcome. I strongly defend the value of work experience and training for any worker seeking to progress their career.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">I strongly attack these activation schemes as a mechanism for the Government to manipulate unemployment figures, further casualise the labour market, normalise the idea of working for free, drive down working conditions and undermine working wages and conditions for all. How many of the 13 who took up positions in the Minister's Department did so under threat or perceived threat of sanction? The number of penalties applied to people not taking up activation schemes such as Gateway and JobBridge has shot up. More than 5,000 people received a reduction in their social welfare payment in 2015. These people are forced to work; they are not doing it voluntarily. In the National Youth Council of Ireland study, 11% said they took part in order to retain their social welfare, 100% were dissatisfied with it and 44% felt the companies - I presume this includes the public sector - use the scheme solely for free labour.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">The Deputy should acknowledge that every country with an unemployment problem develops work experience programmes as part of its response. The OECD has been very strong in advocating that Ireland needs to have a wider range of these sort of programmes that give people a bridge from whatever they did in school or college to the employment environment. Those schemes are continually evaluated by the Department of Social Protection, which has weeded out cases of abuse. These work experience programmes prevail in all countries with strong activation policies that provide quality opportunities for people to progress in their careers. JobBridge is no different; more than 60% have progressed to unemployment from the programme. A wide variety of employers is engaged and many companies have put substantial amounts of money into developing the training programmes that give people genuinely good work experience on these programmes. They are an important and valuable part of the response to unemployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">As this Government's term in office draws to a close, the cancer of bogus self-employment still exists within the State - in the construction industry and many other sectors. It has hollowed out the working conditions of ordinary workers around the country. In some sectors, direct labour is becoming rarer and this is also affecting the Government's tax income. Recently, the Labour Party stated in its manifesto that it will deal with this issue - not today, though, but in the next Government. What can the Minister of State do in the next ten, 15 or 20 days of this Government to fix this problem?</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I thank Deputy Tóibín for raising this issue. Ireland has a well-resourced and proactive labour inspectorate in the form of the Workplace Relations Commission. Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis. Where the inspection service receives complaints of bogus self-employment or bogus subcontracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social Protection's Scope section for investigation either solely by the recipient or jointly with the WRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> In most cases, it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt about the employment status of the individual, the relevant Departments and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals. This code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> The Workplace Relations Commission has statutory authority to share information with both Revenue and the Department of Social Protection. Such information-sharing takes place regularly between the Workplace Relations Commission inspectors and their counterparts in these bodies. In cases of mutual interest, joint operations may also be carried out. This exchange and sharing of information is a valuable element of the inspection process and contributes to uncovering non-compliance in the areas covered by the relevant bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> Having looked at this issue very closely over the last period of time, I believe this area needs further examination and closer attention. I am concerned that the law has not kept pace with the phenomenon of what might be termed bogus self-employment, a phrase with which I have become familiar in recent times. I would like to have the time to respond to this issue in the short period of time we have left available in the parliamentary term but the parliamentary clock is ticking. I have said publicly in the past week or so that if a mandate is renewed by the Irish people in the coming weeks, the approach I would like to take is to root out bogus self-employment in certain areas of the economy where it has become an issue. I will do so primarily by reforming the legal definitions of employment status to include a test determining the status of employment in keeping with Revenue guidelines and in line with recent European Court of Justice judgments.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">Lord, give the workers rights, but just not yet. There are 365,000 RTCs in the State and it is estimated that approximately 80% of them are bogus - in other words, they are workers who should be directly employed but are subcontracting. This means that employers get to shirk their responsibility with regard to the minimum wage, employer PRSI, illness benefit and jobseekers' benefit. The clock is ticking. This is not a new issue being raised today; I raised it in this Chamber when the Kishogue dispute was going on. I had to filibuster a committee for hours to get the Government to focus on it. These RTCs are being abused so frequently that job agencies are advertising roles in the construction industry for which people do not have to pay holiday or sick pay, give proper notice or deal with direct employment. The Kishogue workers were getting €5 per hour. They had to get up every morning at 6 o'clock, stand for months on end at the place of work and try to draw attention to their situation. They had to climb cranes to draw the attention of the Minister to this issue. The worst thing about it is that it was a State contract. The Department of Education and Skills was the ultimate employer in this. All the tools and elements of the State that the Minister of State said are there to police this problem did not police it in the case of Kishogue. The school was built before the Department of Social Protection made a ruling on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">We all know that responsibility for determining employment or self-employment status rests with the Revenue Commissioners and the Scope section of the Department of Social Protection. In cases I have dealt with in my constituency over the years, it has taken a considerable amount of time for the Scope section to deal with cases referred to it. Deputy Tóibín is quite right that in cases where bogus self-employment emerges, it is a case that the Exchequer can potentially lose considerable revenues owed to it in terms of the status of that individual, whether they are employed or self-employed. There are a range of different employment protections that would be forgone by somebody in a bogus self-employment situation. It is an area that I intend to address in a comprehensive way over the next period of time. As I said, the parliamentary clock is ticking. We have introduced a range of different industrial relations reforms over the last while, particularly over the last year and a half. It is an area that requires more attention and I intend to attend to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">ICTU has estimated that €600 million has been lost in taxation revenue since 2007, which is a multiple of the water charge income for the State. There are 27,000 sole traders paying approximately €2,886 in PRSI payments in an Exchequer year. Not only does this really hurt families in those sectors but it also hurts the income of the State. The Minister of State said that he intends to work on this. The major problem I have with the Labour Party's approach to many of these workers' rights areas is the inaction it has shown. When it came to zero-hour contracts, the Minister of State did not act but he commissioned a report. When it came to the Clerys tactical insolvency, the Minister of State did not act but is now commissioning the second report on that issue. The Minister of State is good with tea and sympathy, writing reports and being appalled but he is not good with action. Whatever promises he makes on workers' rights in the next month will be devalued by five years of inaction.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I do not trust one word that comes out of the mouth of Sinn Féin about employment rights, zero-hour contracts, low-hour contracts or anything else, when one considers the low-pay economy over which trade unionists say Sinn Féin presides in Northern Ireland. Consequently, I will not take lectures from it on its views on employment rights or the performance of the Labour Party in government on such rights. That is for others to decide. One will find that many others who are more expert in this area than Deputy Peadar Tóibín and who work on a daily basis with people to protect their employment rights and advance their agenda through trade unions are quite satisfied with the performance of the Labour Party in government, as well as with what it intends to do if returned to government. Based on the track record of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, I do not have much hope it would implement anything particularly strong for workers in the Republic were it to be successful in getting into government after the next general election. While I do not believe Sinn Féin wishes to be in government, that is another day's work.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">I thank the Deputy for raising this question. An adequate supply of office and manufacturing facilities is a key component of successful enterprise development. As part of the regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015, I announced that IDA Ireland would invest €150 million over five years in property solutions designed to allow it to create opportunities to win additional projects for all regions. As part of this programme of investment, IDA Ireland is building nine advance facilities around the country, in particular in locations where the private sector has been slow to build. This includes the delivery of an advance facility in Galway. In marketing Galway as part of the west region, IDA Ireland not only promotes its own property portfolio but, where appropriate, advises prospective investors of available privately-owned properties that may be suitable. Enterprise Ireland does not provide office space or manufacturing facilities directly, but it has given its support to the provision of innovation or enterprise spaces. For example, it funded the NUI Galway business innovation centre and the innovation in business centre at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, which provide spaces for spin-out companies, start-ups and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_122"> The record results for 2015 for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland show there are 21,575 people employed by client companies of the agencies in County Galway, an increase of 2,964 since 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I thank the Minister for his reply. I certainly welcome the plans put in place by the Government which, as he noted, entail an investment of €150 million over five years. The objectives of the regional Action Plan for jobs and the Action Plan for Jobs to monitor implementation of policies on the regional plans certainly are welcome because it is not simply a case of publishing plans. One must also ensure they are implemented. Previous plans have certainly been implemented. As the Minister noted, there has been considerable success in IDA Ireland-supported job creation initiatives, with more than 60 IDA Ireland-supported companies in County Galway creating jobs. More than 3,900 jobs have been created by IDA Ireland-backed companies since 2011, not to mention the indirect jobs created in small to medium-sized enterprises. The Minister attended a recent jobs announcement in Galway at which I was present. In his contribution he asked the chief executive officer to let him know of issues he had. As the chief executive officer mentioned the delays he had experienced in sourcing an adequate building in Galway city, this is an issue that must continue to be pushed because it would be a sad day were it not possible to create jobs because of a lack of space or suitable buildings in a city such as Galway.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I agree absolutely that this is important and not only has the Government acted on it through acquisition but planning permission has now been granted for a 40,000 sq. ft. office space in Galway. As the process for delivery will be selected in the coming year, the Government is moving ahead in that regard. However, private property developers should also have confidence given the flow of new wins in Galway. This should give the private sector confidence to commit to building because there is a strong flow of investment. Galway is highly successful and its record speaks for itself. As companies within the remit of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland have seen a 15% increase in employment in the space of just four years, there is a significant flow and through IDA Ireland's property section, the Government will work with the private sector to try to give it the confidence it needs to commit to invest where it can assist in meeting some of the needs of new investors.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">I thank the Minister for his reply. As I stated, I welcome the initiatives that have been taken. Will IDA Ireland be pursuing other projects, even by merely advancing towards planning permission? The planning process can cause delays and there have been certain instances of this in Galway. I obviously welcome the provision of 40,000 sq. ft. of office space, but were the agency to pursue planning in other areas, it might act as an incentive to attract investment in other areas. There are adequate IDA Ireland lands in other areas, including Athenry, Parkmore, Dangan and Oranmore.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The Deputy is absolutely correct that IDA Ireland is seeking to promote actively its property portfolio. It has a significant property portfolio in eight locations across the county. The Department and its agencies are clearly seeking to promote these locations as sources that could provide property solutions for companies that are investing. However, on foot of the Deputy's contribution, I will also ask IDA Ireland to consider making available space throughout Galway city and county and to examine whether initiatives could be taken, in addition to what is already being done, to focus on a decent flow of property to meet the needs of investors.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_128">That, pursuant to Standing Order 177, Standing Order 131 is modified to permit an instruction to the Committee to which the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill, 2015 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments, that it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_129">(<i>a</i>) an amendment to section 37 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 to make provision for the transitional arrangements that will apply in relation to the transfer of the power to prosecute for summary offences under relevant enactments from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Workplace Relations Commission; an amendment to Paragraph 5, Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 to amend an incorrect reference;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_130">(<i>b</i>) an amendment to the Employment Equality Act 1998 to insert a new section 101(4A) to ensure that a complainant cannot seek redress under both the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act in respect of the same dismissal within the new framework for the adjudication of disputes under employment and equality legislation;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_131">(<i>c</i>) an amendment to section 34 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to correct a typographical error; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_132">(<i>d</i>) an amendment to section 916 of the Companies Act 2014 to correct a referencing error which has had the unintentional effect of limiting the power of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) to levy the prescribed accountancy bodies for the purposes of meeting expenses properly incurred by it in performing its functions under the Act; </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_133">and to change the title of the Bill and make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Deputies will recall that I indicated on Committee Stage that I would be bringing forward these amendments on Report Stage. I understand Deputies will already have received an information note setting out the purpose of these amendments. As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has undertaken and recently completed an extensive programme of reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations procedures. The legislation which has given statutory effect to the reform programme, namely, the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was enacted on 20 May last year. This legislation provides for the establishment of a new two-tier workplace relations structure to replace the previously existing five workplace relations bodies. A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission was created from 1 October 2015 and a separate appeals body is in operation which is effectively an expanded Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission, including the Rights Commissioner Service, the Equality Tribunal, the first instance jurisdiction of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA. In addition, the WRC provides an early resolution service to facilitate and encourage the resolution of individual complaints at as early a stage as possible and so obviate the need for formal adjudication or investigation to the greatest extent possible. The Equality Tribunal, NERA and the Labour Relations Commission have been disestablished following the transfer of their functions to the WRC. The Employment Appeals Tribunal will be disestablished once it has dealt with the caseload submitted to it prior to 1 October 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> As Deputies who were involved in the legislative process will know, the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is complex legislation. It makes provision for the establishment of the new structures for the resolution and adjudication of complaints and disputes across the entire corpus of employment rights and equality legislation. As a result of the introduction of these new structures the Workplace Relations Act made consequential amendments to 24 primary Acts, including the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Employment Equality Act 1998, 34 specified parts or sections of Acts and numerous statutory instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The amendment to Section 37 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is essential to provide for the transitional arrangements that will apply in relation to the prosecution of summary offences under relevant enactments which had been instituted prior to the establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission on 1 October 2015. Section 37 of the Act cannot be commenced until this amendment has been effected.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The amendment to Schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is of a drafting nature. This amendment is required to amend an incorrect reference to the Employment Permits Act 2006 which was included in paragraph 5 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Similarly, the amendment to section 34 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 is of a drafting nature and is required to correct a typographical error in the numbering of subparagraphs (6) and (7) within that section arising from an amendment to that Act by the Workplace Relations Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The amendment to the Employment Equality Act 1998 to insert a new section 101(4A) was initially provided for in section 83(1)(m)(iii) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015. However, this provision was inadvertently deleted by section 20(1)(n)(i) of the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015 when a number of other amendments to the Workplace Relations Act were being effected. This amendment is essential to ensure that a person will not be able to obtain redress under both the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act in respect of the same dismissal. The new section 101(4A) provides that a person who has referred a dismissal complaint under both the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act has to elect between one or the other by a prescribed date or a date to be inferred from regulations by the Minister. If the person fails to elect by this date the discriminatory dismissal complaint will be deemed to have been withdrawn. Therefore, it will be necessary to make provision for section 101(4A) to be reinserted into the Employment Equality Act 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The Companies Act 2014 was enacted on 23 December 2014 and commenced on 1 June 2015. The Act consolidated the 17 previously existing Companies Acts 1963 to 2013 into one Act and also introduced a number of reforms which are designed to make it easier to operate a company in Ireland. The 2014 Act repealed and replaced the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003. The 2003 Act established Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, and provided that it would be part-funded by the prescribed accountancy bodies. In particular, section 14 of the 2003 Act provided that the IAASA could levy prescribed accountancy bodies for the purposes of meeting expenses properly incurred by it in performing its functions. Section 916 of the Companies Act 2014 re-enacted section 14 of the 2003 Act but inadvertently limited the application of monies from the levy. The amendment will ensure that the IAASA can levy the prescribed accountancy bodies for the purposes of meeting expenses properly incurred by it in performing its functions as was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Accordingly, it is proposed that these amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015, the Employment Equality Act 1998, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Companies Act 2014 will be effected through the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">We will be supporting all the amendments. They were signalled by the Minister of State on Committee Stage. This does, however, highlight a discussion all three of us have had. The Workplace Relations Act finished a process I started in 2010. It has taken far too long to bring it through. I know it is complex legislation and that there was a lot of consultation but, politics aside, we need to move faster on these things. The delay was nothing, however, in comparison to the Companies Act which was 12 years in the making and which we are already reviewing in the context of a discussion earlier this morning on Clery's. That Act has been hardly out the door and we are looking at it again. As this Dáil ends, the next Dáil needs to commit to not only political reform but legislative reform also. We can give legislation the scrutiny and consultation required but it should not take five or 12 years, in particular when the legislation relates to a sector that moves as fast as enterprise. Practices and ways of doing business change quickly and our laws need to be able to keep up to speed with those changes. I fully support the motion and Fianna Fáil will support the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_146">In page 3, line 12, after “together;” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_147">“to amend the Employment Equality Act 1998, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Companies Act 2014;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Amendment No. 1 is required to amend the Long Title of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2015 to reflect amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and certain other enactments.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Amendment No. 6 is required to insert a new section 101(4A) into the Employment Equality Act 1998. As I said earlier, this amendment was initially provided for in section 83(1)(m)(iii) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015; however, this provision was inadvertently deleted by section 20(n)(i) of the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015 with a number of other amendments to the Workplace Relations Act that were being effected. This amendment is necessary and ensures, in the new workplace relations adjudication framework, that a complainant cannot recover both under the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act in respect of the same dismissal. The new section 101(4A) provides that a person who has referred a dismissal complaint under both the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Employment Equality Act has to elect between one or the other by a prescribed date or date to be inferred from regulations by the Minister. If the person fails to elect by this date, the discriminatory dismissal complaint will be deemed to have been withdrawn. It is therefore necessary to make provision for section 101(4A) to be reinserted into the Employment Equality Act 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Amendment No. 7 is required to correct a typographical error in section 34 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. Paragraph 13 in Part 1 of Schedule 7 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 amended section 34 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. However, as a result of a typographical error, there are currently two subsections (6) in section 34 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. The proposed amendment to section 34 will correct this error.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> On amendment No. 8, the amendment in paragraph (a) relates to section 37 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Section 37 of the 2015 Act makes provision for the transfer of the power to prosecute for employment-related summary offences under relevant enactments from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Workplace Relations Commission. This amendment is required to make provision for the transitional arrangements that will apply for the transfer of this power from the Minister to the WRC. The amendment will have the effect that the new arrangements for the prosecution of offences, as provided for in section 37, will only apply in respect of offences committed or alleged to have been committed after the commencement of section 37.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The amendment in paragraph (b) relates to an amendment to paragraph 5, Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015. This amendment is necessary to amend an incorrect reference to the Employment Permits Act 2003, which should have read the Employment Permits Act 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> On amendment No. 9, the Companies Act 2014 was enacted on 23 December 2014 and commenced on 1 June 2015. The Act consolidated the previously existing 17 Companies Acts into one Act. One of the Acts which the 2014 Act repealed and replaced was the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003. The 2003 Act established the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA and, in section 14, it provided that this authority could levy prescribed accountancy bodies for the purposes of meeting expenses properly incurred by it in performing its functions. Section 916 of the Companies Act 2014 re-enacted section 14 of the 2003 Act, but inadvertently limited the application of moneys from the levy. This amendment will ensure that the IAASA can levy the prescribed accountancy bodies for the purposes of meeting expenses properly incurred by it in performing its functions as was intended. </p>

          <p eId="para_158">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_159">In page 7, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_160">“(5) The Minister will commission a report within 3 months of the Act becoming operational outlining how the Credit Guarantee Scheme can help make it easier for businesses that owe money to banks exiting the Irish SME market to refinance those debts with domestic institutions.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">This is a repeat of amendments I proposed earlier. The original intention of the credit guarantee scheme when it was introduced in 2012 was never met. It was very clear from early in the scheme's life that it was not going to work. In particular, through no fault of the Minister of State's Department, we were left waiting for this legislation. In the meantime, a serious problem arose for businesses that were being forced to refinance their debts because their financial institution was exiting the market. They were being thrown to the pillar banks with little opportunity, or were being sold off to various vulture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> While the Minister of State has extended the provisions of the scheme to allow for that, I am anxious that this particular cohort would be the focus of some attention by those institutions promoting the credit guarantee scheme. I would like to get a sense of the scheme helping those businesses, and to see that they are actually left to the responsibility of one of the pillar banks as opposed to one of these funds that are entering this space. Commissioning this report and putting this provision into the Bill will allow us to assess that.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I thank Deputy Calleary for raising this proposed amendment, which he also tabled on Committee Stage. As I indicated then, I am not accepting it because this specific area is not appropriate for such legislation. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 does not empower the corporation to provide for loans direct to SMEs, as the Deputy knows, and any change to this is a matter for the Minister for Finance. It is achieved through on-lenders. The approach of the Bill will work to broaden out the attraction of the scheme and the type of financiers that could be involved in the credit guarantee scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> More generally, I assure Deputy Calleary that my Department, the banks and other finance providers and the SBCI will actively promote the revised system and ensure that businesses are aware of the possibilities available under the new enhanced schemes, and that the Department will report publicly and transparently on progress in this regard on a quarterly basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I move amendment No. 5:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_166">In page 7, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_167">“(5) (a) The Minister shall work with his colleague in the Department of Finance to facilitate a role for State promotional financial institutions such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in the scheme in order to enhance the provision of credit to SMEs directly.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_168">(b) The Minister shall be empowered to give counter-guarantees designed to enable State promotional financial institutions access to match guarantee facilities from EU funding sources such as Horizon 2020 funds earmarked for SMEs and the European Fund for Strategic Investments.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">This amendment is similar but slightly different. Picking up on the Minister of State's comments about the strategic banking corporation, the commitment he gave as a member of the Labour Party and that was given in the programme for Government - remember that - was that a State bank would be established which would be a separately functioning business bank to lend directly to enterprise. Instead, we got the SBCI which is a far fluffier version of what was proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> What we need is something to challenge the very cosy consensus that now exists between our remaining banks around business services. That cosy consensus has resulted in business banking fees being the highest in the eurozone, and in services being withdrawn. Those in the service or retail sectors in towns across the country are being told on what days they can and cannot lodge coin. That has knock-on consequences for security. The price of lending and asset financing in this jurisdiction is far higher than in other eurozone countries, and this is directly because of a lack of competition. What the SBCI should be doing is challenging that lack and breaking the situation up. What it is actually doing is making the situation even cosier by lending through the existing pillar banks and directing businesses to go to those banks that have let them down in the way that they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> The SBCI needs more teeth. It is certainly beginning to have an impact and I give it credit for that. However, its role as an agent of the existing pillar banks is hampering its standing and its ability to do what we want. We need the commitment in the programme for Government to be honoured in the form of a separate, State backed enterprise bank out there fighting on the streets.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_172">One of the great failures of this Government concerns credit to small business and the debt distress that exists among thousands of small business owners. It is a fact that, in creating two pillar banks, the Government created an oligopoly. It should be no surprise that those pillar banks display oligopolistic behaviour. In other words, they have great supplier power while customers right through the State have very weak purchaser power. That is the nature of the market. Sometimes it is hard for governments to do things, but one thing they can do is structure the market. A very simple way of breaking down that oligopolistic power would be for the Government to allow the credit union system to function properly as regards SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">From what I can see, the credit union sector is being held back and run down instead of being strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> We launched a detailed public banking system document based on the public banking system that exists in Germany. This would allow for more suppliers in the market and reduce the powers of the two pillar banks, which I believe would change the behaviour of the two pillar banks enormously. We see the behaviour of those banks as they withdraw from small towns and stop the credit flow to small businesses. This is why the Government has had to create the whole ecosystem of funding models, none of which, unfortunately, has worked satisfactorily. That is not by accident, given there were certain constraints that prevented them from acting properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Across the State many small businesses are either at the edge of a debt cliff or seriously hampered from development because of excess debt. During the week a small but well-known business, McElhinneys of Athboy, County Meath, was in court with Bank of Ireland in regard to a major debt. Receivers moved into the company's building last week, which led to altercations in which people were injured. Allegations have been made and people have gone to the Garda, which is in the middle of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I have stated from the start of all of this, five years ago, that the Minister should have Enterprise Ireland create a small department of individuals who would go into small businesses that are in debt distress and help them to function. They should identify what element of the business is functional and separate it from its toxic debt, so the business and jobs could be saved. The Minister of State will know of another business in Meath, Spicer's, which was on the go since the 1830s. It survived famines and wars but did not survive this credit crunch.</p>

        <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_87" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
          <from>Deputy Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_178">In regard to Deputy Calleary's amendment No. 5, we debated the role of the SBCI on Second Stage and Committee Stage. In the course of the latter, I introduced a comprehensive new Part 3 to the Bill. This contains provision for the SBCI to work with the Minister through this legislation to continue to enhance the provision of credit to SMEs and to provide a role for the Minister to be able to give counter-guarantees intended to enable the SBCI to unlock funds from EU sources in order to share the risks across the banks, the SBCI, the Minister and the potential EU sources. I believe this is an important new function which will leverage considerable resources from EU programmes, such as the COSME and Horizon 2020 funding that has been earmarked for SMEs, as well as the European Fund for Strategic Investment administered by the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund, probably better known as the Juncker plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Opportunities exist and we are providing for those within this legislation in order to leverage and unlock funds from EU sources and share the risk across the system. Those innovations have gone a large way towards addressing our shared view for an active role for the SBCI in this area and ensuring that greater access to EU funding for SMEs is provided in an imaginative and innovative way. I hope the Deputy would agree with me on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The credit situation for small businesses is improving. The Department monitors this very closely and works with the business representative organisations, the Department of Finance, the SBCI and others to make sure we can achieve our ambitions in terms of finance for growth for the SME sector. Nobody needs to be reminded why we have two pillar banks in this country. That aside, I expect we will see very innovative forms of competition emerging over the next period of time. Just after its establishment, the SBCI is playing a very significant role in terms of providing new sources of funding and new opportunities for SMEs, including lower cost funding to financial institutions being passed on to SMEs and market access for new entrants to the SME lending market, thereby creating real competition. I believe this is creating a much more dynamic environment than was hitherto the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I look forward to reviewing figures from the SBCI over the next period as I believe it will be a very significant success. However, it is also important that we reflect on the success of the credit guarantee scheme, notwithstanding the fact that we have reviewed the scheme and taken on board the points made in that review to make sure the scheme achieves its objective. By and large, it has worked. A considerable number of jobs would not have been maintained or created if it was not for the fact we have this credit guarantee scheme, through which some €16 million in funding has been unlocked, supporting a considerable number of jobs across the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_182">I share the Minister of State's wish that the SBCI would unlock any funds that are available and that we would get those funds to business. However, the difficulty is how we get them to business, given we are getting them through the existing pillar banks, which are not competitive. An Irish-based business will pay more for EU funding through COSME than a UK, Spain or Germany-based business because of the structure we have. If we instead had the SBCI operating in its own right, using those funds to lend directly to business, all of our shared wishes in regard to SME finance would be met far more quickly. I would also highlight that the latest ISME report on SME finance showed a weakening of access in the last quarter of 2015, a point we also need to be aware of. To have an institution that lends directly to business as opposed to lending in a wholesale manner is only fulfilling the commitment the Minister of State signed up to in the 2011 programme for Government.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Gerald Nash)<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_291">In the House last November I stated the Government's view that finance was the lifeblood of every business and, in particular, was essential for working capital and in feeding investment, expansion, growth and job creation. The Government has focused on all of these elements in the past five years and the results are now being seen the length and breadth of the country. In 2012 the Government introduced legislation dealing with credit guarantees to free up access to finance at a very difficult time for small and medium enterprises, SMEs. It kept the operation of the scheme under review. The review process pointed to the need for reform and to expand the scheme. The Bill will do this by extending credit guarantees to govern non-traditional or non-bank sources of finance such as lessors, factors, invoice discounters and others. There will also be a rebalancing of the risk elements between the State and the extended pool of finance providers to make the scheme a more attractive proposition for the latter. The Minister will be empowered to give new counter-guarantees to promotional financial institutions such as the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland designed to facilitate and enhance risk sharing between all finance providers and access to available EU funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> This legislation, particularly those aspects which facilitate the leveraging of EU funding, will significantly benefit firms, employees, SMEs and the economy at large. It will lead to the generation of jobs and the achievement of the targets we set out in our ten-year enterprise strategy, Enterprise 2025, and the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 which we launched this week. This will help us to achieve our objectives for jobs growth and exports. </p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I thank all Members for their help in passing the Bill and their contributions during its passage. It is a major contribution to the well-being of citizens and the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">I welcome the review of the scheme and commend the officials involved and the Minister of State, in particular, for the energy he brings to dealing with the issue. The legislation is a snapshot of much of the Government's spin and waffle on job creation and support for SMEs. The scheme was launched in 2012 by the Taoiseach, the then Tánaiste, about whom I had forgotten, and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton. It was indicated that there would be lending of €100 million, but it has struggled consistently to do this. As I have stated previously, our ability to respond as a Parliament when something is not working must be enhanced. That is a cross-party issue. The scheme could have done much more had it been changed quickly, although I know that is not the fault of the Department. We must look at staffing in the Office of the Attorney General with respect to the availability of legislative legal skills in order that the process can be much quicker. The scheme should have had such a role to play, particularly in the refinancing of debts for exiting financial institutions. Unfortunately, I fear that opportunity may have been lost. We called a vote earlier to emphasise that a commitment had been made in the programme for Government to set up a separate State enterprise bank rather than a wholesaler of EU funding to be provided for existing State banks. Between the pillar banks, when it comes to servicing business, there is a cosy consensus which leads to a lack of services for business. That consensus must be challenged and broken. There should be a separate Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland with the ability to get out on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I say, "Well done," to the Minister of State and his officials, but we must ensure the next Dáil will be empowered in order that changes may be made and our legislative response to bad or weak legislation will be quicker than it has been on this occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus le foireann na Roinne mar gheall ar an mBille seo. Is trua é go mbíonn meon an Rialtais maidir le tuairimí an Fhreasúra dúnta i gcónaí. Rinneamar a lán iarrachta feabhas a chur ar an mBille seo, ar feadh trí uair a' chloig, agus níor éist an Rialtas linn ag an am. Chuir sé bac ar ár gcuid tuairimí. Is trua é sin. Ní bheadh muid anseo inniu ag plé an Bhille seo dá mbeadh meon níos oscailte ag an Rialtas maidir leis seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> There are thousands of businesses around the country that have invested everything they have to keep them open. People have remortgaged their houses and sold any asset they had. They have not taken a wage from their business for perhaps a year or two in order that their business can struggle through this process. They have had this difficulty because the Government, in a pig-headed fashion, decided there should only be two pillar banks in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">It decided that 85% of the banking market will be in their hands. The Minister of State said he expects to see the other options I put to him earlier arrive in the market in the future. Those other options should be proactively encouraged and developed and we should ensure there is space within the market. These options are the credit union sector, the public banking sector and the crowd-funding sector, which is at a very low level of development in this State compared to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> Every day, there will be businesses like McElhinneys in Athboy with 30 staff which will be teetering on the edge of existence, which will be battling their way through the courts, which will be seeking to negotiate with the banks and which will, in many cases, be turned down and close. The Government will persist in running most of the credit facilities it has created through those same banks. It is time we radically changed the banking market into a much healthier one. When people measure and analyse this Government on this issue in years to come, the failed and broken nature of the banking system will be seen as one of its major outputs.</p>

A disqualification which results from being convicted of any of the specified offences can only relate to driving a mechanically propelled vehicle but the legal advice available to me is that this should be specified in section 30(3) to protect against any possible challenge.</p>

As they are aware, we made great progress last year in reducing the number of people who died on the roads, although it was still too many.

          <p eId="para_320">I thank the Minister for getting the Bill through before the end of this Dáil term. We have seen in the past decade that the most important element in reducing the numbers of deaths and injuries on the roads is the continued upgrading and improvement of the legislative framework. There is much more work to be done by the Minister or whoever will occupy his seat in the future in codifying the law to deal with the scourge of drink driving, particularly those who seek to avoid justice. It is without doubt the most tested legislation on a daily basis. While everybody is entitled to a defence before the law, the public finds it difficult to accept that somebody who was clearly drunk fails to be prosecuted.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> In the past ten years we have taken a bipartisan approach to the legislation and I hope that will continue in the next Parliament. It is the best way to do it. Political point-scoring or a slight difference of opinion should not be allowed to cloud the work that needs to be done. Much has been done in the past 15 or 20 years and I hope that work will continue. In his relatively short time in office the Minister has played a significant role in that work.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The purpose of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 is to provide a robust and effective framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest, as well as providing for a streamlined and consistent approach to ethics legislation across the public sector. It will ensure Ireland’s disclosure and conflict of interest framework corresponds to international best practice and will be integral to the quality and efficacy of public governance and the addressing of corruption risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> This significant Bill was developed following a root and branch examination of the current system and international best practice and will ensure Ireland’s disclosure and conflict of interest framework corresponds to best practice on the international stage. I strongly believe this legislation is key to ensuring the quality and efficacy of our public administration and the addressing of corruption risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 consolidates and enhances the existing outdated and piecemeal legislation and gives effect to the recommendations of the tribunals and the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC. For the first time, a uniform framework of ethical regulations will apply at national and local level in Ireland. There will now be a consistency of approach to ethical obligations across the public sector and, in a new departure, overarching integrity principles for public officials will be enshrined in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> A dedicated public sector standards commissioner will be appointed who will be empowered to initiate investigations, even in the absence of the receipt of a complaint where there is a suspected contravention of the legislation, or if it is in the public interest to do so. This own initiative investigative power is a reform for which SIPOC has long called.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> The commissioner will be equipped with the tools to ensure there is meaningful engagement and compliance with the legislation. He or she will have enhanced powers of investigation which will ensure he or she is empowered to rigorously examine and investigate potential breaches of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The scope of civil sanctions available to the commissioner has also been enhanced. The Bill also grants the commissioner the power to prosecute offences summarily and issue fines to those not in compliance with their declaration requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> The personal and material scope of declarable interests for public officials will be significantly extended in line with the Mahon tribunal’s recommendations. The disclosures of senior public officials will be published on the commissioner’s website to ensure effective transparency and scrutiny of interests. Private declarable interests are also mandated for senior officials for certain interests such as liabilities above a certain threshold and gifts given in a private capacity to be disclosed periodically on a confidential basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"><i>Ad hoc</i> disclosures must be made by all public officials if and when a conflict of interest arises. This approach is a major innovation in ensuring the disclosure process focuses attention on actual and perceived conflicts of interest as they arise for public officials and extends the personal scope of such disclosures to include the interests of connected parties such as relatives or business partners. The Bill also prohibits the use of insider information in the seeking by public officials of benefits to further their private interests and local elected representatives from dealing professionally with land in certain circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach if he had seen the RTE film "My Homeless Family". I was inundated with calls yesterday from people who were quite shocked by the revelations about the reality of homelessness in Ireland today, and particularly the plight of families in hotels. I do not know if the Taoiseach has seen the programme but it is important that he should do so. Yesterday, he dismissed my arguments on rent allowance, which many of the agencies are saying has driven many vulnerable families into homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The Taoiseach was also asked a specific question concerning NAMA's plans to build 20,000 houses. He was asked if he would instruct NAMA to ensure that 10,000 of those would be social houses. For some time, Deputy Barry Cowen has argued the case for building social houses and to tell NAMA to do so. When one looks at the sale of 442 apartments at Tallaght Cross West to a major international real estate investor for €83 million, it is extraordinary. It illustrates the bankruptcy in terms of the attitude of the State and the Government to homelessness and the lack of any urgency to get to grips with it. Those 442 apartments were sold for about €100,000 each, which is €90,000 less than the modular homes the Taoiseach cannot get built at the moment. Apparently, NAMA offered those apartments to the National Housing Agency and local authorities, but they decided to take up only 65 of them. Meanwhile, 1,600 children are in emergency accommodation of the kind we saw on the programme earlier this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Who is in charge? Why was the offer of apartments not taken up? Why did the State not buy them and get the families out of damp hotel rooms and bed-sits?</p>

          <p eId="para_342">It illustrates in one story how this Government does not get what it is like for people to be in hotel rooms all over this city and across the country. There was a great opportunity to do something there with one, two and three-bedroom apartments at €100,000 each, rather than the €190,000 for modular homes. It is time the Government understood the urgency of this crisis and its impact on families. It has been going on for three years. Threshold and Focus Ireland warned the Taoiseach about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> We have been legally advised that the Taoiseach can instruct NAMA that half the 20,000 houses it is building should be social ones. That would have a huge impact in taking people out of the misery we all saw on RTE on Monday night.</p>

These include the housing assistance programme and the tenancy agreement for increased rent supplement, which have helped thousands of people. Given that the economy is recovering, and it is important that we keep the recovery going, the Government has put €3 billion on the table for social housing to build 117,000 units by 2020. We have given local authority chief executives money, objectives, targets, facilities and the wherewithal to get on and do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Week after week the Deputy comes in here, but he has forgotten any sense of fiscal responsibility. If he wants to take another €2 billion off public services and put it into NAMA housing, then let me hear that proposition from him.

There is a legal process to be gone through here. Deputy Martin wants instant houses. The Government has put public money on the table for every local authority. It has given them their objectives and targets and has told them to get on with this. We are providing help in respect of the housing assistance programme and supplementary welfare, which has helped 5,800 people. Some 2,000 have been housed who were on the housing list last year and are being placed in voided units that are now renovated and comfortable.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">None of this happened. The Government stole Fianna Fáil's social and economic policies and also perpetuated its culture of cronyism and political patronage. In the past week the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, chose to appoint Mr. David Begg as chairperson of the Pensions Authority. The arrogant way in which she did this, irrespective of Mr. Begg's suitability, made a mockery of the Taoiseach's promise to deliver new politics, but she is not on her own. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton; the Ministers of State, Deputies Gerald Nash and Joe McHugh, and the Taoiseach have done the same. The Taoiseach conspired with the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to appoint the Fine Gael candidate, Mr. John McNulty, to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in order that he would qualify to seek election to the Seanad. Does the Taoiseach agree that all of this cronyism is in contravention of the pledges he made to the electorate?</p>

          <p eId="para_435">I take Deputy Gerry Adams's comments about cynicism and conviction at the distance warranted. The Government wants to ensure the recovery under way will continue and be spread throughout the country. To do this its priority is to continue to create more and better jobs such that work will clearly be seen to pay. To create more jobs one will have to strengthen the economy to invest in public services provided by teachers, nurses, gardaí, prison officers, special needs assistants and resource teachers. We are not relying only on the reduction of taxes to make the economy strong. It is actually both because it leads to the creation of more jobs which generates the strength to invest in public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has introduced the Public Sector Standards Bill. Deputy Gerry Adams spoke about political reform. The Government has held more referenda than any previous Government. It set up the Convention on the Constitution and some of its recommendations have been implemented. Some will be implemented and others may the subject of future referenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> The Government got rid of corporate donations. We have made changes to how business is run here, including giving the right to individual Deputies to introduce Private Members' Bills, complete independence and authority to Members of the House in the election of a successor to the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Barrett. These are just some of the issues on which the need for political reform is mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> On appointments to State boards, I support the Tánaiste in the motion against her as a capable person in her work and duty as Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection. On public appointments, the criteria are now drawn up between Departments and the Public Appointments Service for the range of qualifications needed by individuals who apply directly to and are vetted independently by the Public Appointments Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">In my question I tried to contrast the rhetoric as the Taoiseach tapped into widespread public anger and his failure to deliver on the promises he had made.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">He avoided answering that when he responded and is skirting around the issue. He made detailed promises on political reform. He promised a public appointments Act that has never materialised. Why? The Taoiseach promised a vote in presidential elections for Irish citizens living abroad and a more transparent system of political funding. He promised to create an electoral commission. He has ignored numerous recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. It has been broken promise after broken promise. People still want fairness, equality and transparency.</p>

Interest rates were more than 15% and unemployment was 15% too. We had a haemorrhage of emigration, 300,000 jobs lost and a total collapse of our banks. People's ambitions and their life careers were all gone because of the antics of, and maladministration by, the previous Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">I want to raise the important issue of health and the urgent need for action in this country. Yesterday, we had 522 people on hospital trolleys. Beaumont Hospital in my constituency had 44 people on trolleys. These are our people, our senior citizens and our sick on trolleys. We have a crisis in this country. Does the Taoiseach accept we have a crisis when it comes to the health system, particularly in accident and emergency departments?</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> What is the Taoiseach's vision and plan for the health service? I also strongly challenge the Taoiseach on the gross misrepresentation of the beds issue. Between 300 and 350 people have died as a direct result of overcrowding in our accident and emergency departments. There is a desperate situation and crisis in our health service. That is twice the number of people who die on the roads each year. The Government spin comes out with claims that it is not about beds but that it is a more complex issue than that. Dr. Fergal Hickey, an emergency medicine consultant at Sligo General Hospital, recently said: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_482">Undoubtedly we need a sustained programme to develop additional bed capacity both in acute hospitals but also in community facilities. More suitable facilities for those with chronic medical conditions and a greater capacity to better care for those elderly patients who need more acute, though not necessarily hospital care, are also urgently required.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">It is about beds. </p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Six months ago, I walked the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital with a group of doctors and nurses. They were looking for between 80 and 100 beds. The Minister for Health last week was bragging on radio and television that he was going to give Beaumont Hospital 30 beds. That will not even take the 44 people off the trolleys there. What is the Taoiseach going to do about the health service and, in particular, the people on trolleys in our hospitals?</p>

          <p eId="para_487">The Deputy can come back in with a supplementary question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_246">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_488">Some 1,000 beds were taken out of the system. These have to be put back in. This requires investment in facilities, nurses, doctors and other staff. That means one needs an economy that can actually drive that.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> An extra €117 million has been put in to this area, along with extra staffing put in place. There is a three-pronged approach to addressing the problem. These include measures to reduce numbers of people coming into hospitals, the expansion of the community intervention teams to deliver services outside of hospitals and in communities, as well as the use of community hospitals, such as Mount Carmel, a new facility to assist in that regard. There are also measures to expand capacity to change work practices in different hospitals. As of 14 January, 111 beds were opened out of 154 which had been closed. Some 200 out of 326 new beds have now been opened with the remainder to open this month and in early February. A further 750 additional nurses in the health service were employed more than a year ago. Since September 2011, more than 300 additional consultants have been appointed to acute hospitals, including 78 appointments made last year. There has been real investment in the fair deal scheme, bringing the waiting time down for a nursing home place from 16 weeks to between two weeks, which is satisfactory. Other measures include reducing the level of delayed discharges in our hospitals, freeing up a further 300 beds; the opening of 170 community beds all over the country; 1,200 additional home care packages which apply where people want to stay at home, and rightly so.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> There have been some improvements since mid-November in the number of patients on trolleys in emergency departments. An analysis performance through a 30-day moving average shows a 10% improvement in the overall numbers. Although it is not as satisfactory as one would wish, it is heading in the right direction. It is important to note that on average 3,000 patients present to emergency departments every day, a 7% increase on last year, with some 200 patients presenting at larger emergency departments every day. Up to 83% of those patients are typically discharged or admitted within nine hours of registration, which includes patient assessment, acquired diagnostics and treatment. It is an ongoing challenge and extra resources are being provided, as well as extra personnel. </p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Deputy Finian McGrath will be aware that the Minister for Health introduced the escalation policy if numbers increase above a certain level in emergency departments. That was the subject of intense discussions between management and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, recently. I hope that is proving of benefit in emergency departments where it applies.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I am very disappointed with the Taoiseach's answer; he has again come out with the usual response that it is a more complicated problem. I have three questions for the Taoiseach. Does he consider it is acceptable that people over the age of 80 are languishing on trolleys for 24 to 48 hours and suffering in severe pain? These are our senior citizens who paid their taxes all their lives. Can I bury the myth in regard to the response he spun a while ago about primary care? I will quote a senior consultant. He said, "Those calling for investment in primary care as a purported solution to emergency department [overcrowding] ... miss the point that the current difficulty is caused by the warehousing of admitted hospital inpatients in [emergency departments] ... not the patients who could be more appropriately treated in [a] primary care [group] ... who certainly do not end up languishing on trolleys". The Taoiseach needs to listen to the front-line workers. Again, he and his Government seem to be totally out of touch.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Will the Taoiseach for once and for all listen to the nurses and the doctors but also accept the reality that in order to deal with the accident and emergency crisis we need to increase bed capacity? Thirty beds in Beaumont Hospital is not enough, 80 are needed, and that is the reality. If the Taoiseach was to go around the country and visit Deputy Halligan's constituency in Waterford, he would find that is also the reality there and in other hospitals. We need to increase bed capacity and ensure that the necessary resources are put in place. We need to take the tough decisions and not give tax cuts to wealthy people while we have people dying on trolleys. Some 300 to 350 of our citizens die every year because of the current crisis. People need to wake up to that reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">-----and extra staff are being appointed, including 750 extra nurses and 300 consultants. With 1,000 beds having been taken out of the system bed capacity is an issue, which brings me back to the central point that with our economy recovering, we need to be able to keep that in focus in order that investment can take place to provide for these very facilities that people need.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> I do not agree or say it is acceptable that persons of senior years should have to wait for very long periods on trolleys in hospitals. Much of the focus is on ensuring that does not happen. It was the focus of intense discussions between the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and management in hospitals in the recent past. An agreement was reached on that and I hope that management will be able to put in place the changes for the facilities within those hospitals that staff need and that staff have complained about in the sense of not being able to look after their patients to the level to which they have been trained. </p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Primary care is a central feature of Government policy on health and the more people who can be treated in the community and at primary care centres and not have a requirement to go hospital in the first place, the less pressure there will be on accident and emergency departments. It is a part of a three-pronged approach to provide facilities as close to people as possible within the primary care system and, within a recovering economy, to be able to invest where possible. That includes bed capacity and staff and personnel who are trained to deal with these matters. It is always a challenge, as the Deputy is well aware.</p>

The reappointment of a ministerial nominee to the board will take effect from 28 June 2016. This is an extraordinary development where the Government seems to be-----</p>

          <p eId="para_525"> With regard to the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Act 2014 and the GSOC issue, yesterday the Taoiseach was very quick to dismiss the comments that were attributed to him in yesterday's newspapers in respect of GSOC. I indicated that Deputy Niall Collins was bringing forward legislation to bring in judicial oversight in terms of GSOC's capacity to monitor telephone records. Will the Taoiseach give Government time to allow us to take Deputy Niall Collins's Bill in that regard? It would require GSOC to apply to the High Court before it would monitor any telephones. That would protect press freedom and it would strike a reasonable balance in this situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Tá trí cheist agam, ceist faoi Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and the health information Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Tá Bille a bhaineann le leasú ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla ar liosta A, ach an ngeallann an Taoiseach go mbeidh sé foilsithe go luath agus roimh an toghchán? I mo bharúil, theip ar an Rialtas an Ghaeilge a chosaint agus theip air Sráid Uí Mhórdha a chosaint fosta. Anois, i 2016, beidh toghchán againn roimh i bhfad, ach níl an tAcht againn. Cén lá, seachtain nó mí an mbeidh an Bille foilsithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The Taoiseach is aware that the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill is about protecting children and vulnerable citizens against sexual exploitation. It seeks to make it a criminal offence for those who try to buy sexual services. It is very important legislation. Legislation already exists in the North which decriminalises people involved in prostitution. This is important legislation which the Taoiseach told Teachta Pádraig Mac Lochlainn in December was a priority but he gave no information on when the Bill will be in the Dáil. The Bill is currently in the Seanad. When will it be introduced in the Dáil? Will the Taoiseach commit to having the Bill enacted before the election?</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The heads of the health information Bill were cleared last November. It is part of the Taoiseach's ill-fated, infamous five-point plan, which has spectacularly failed with awful consequences. The Minister said no more than 70 patients a day should be on trolleys. Yesterday, there were 522 patients on trolleys and today there are 536, which is a shame and a huge indictment of the Government. The Government has created chaos instead of stability.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">The mortgage credit directive is due for transposition into Irish law by 21 March this year. As the Taoiseach might know, the directive is extremely important. It relates to the rights of people buying mortgages. We have seen in the past that the banks have trampled on those rights in this State. The directive has 29 specific areas where the Government can go further than the minimum required under the directive. It is questionable whether secondary legislation will suffice to implement the directive, which contains measures designed to prevent reckless lending, something that is not law in this State and therefore we have the untouchable bankers walking about because what they did was not illegal. When will this statutory instrument come forward and when will we have a proper debate with enough time to deal with this crucially important issue, which has affected so many people across the State? Under the Taoiseach's watch, there are still 100,000 families in mortgage distress five years on from the Government taking office.</p>

            <p eId="para_619">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for attending this afternoon to address this topical issue. I also thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this matter. It is topical and is causing some distress for the inshore fishing fleet throughout the country, in particular those along the south-west coast who have been hit extremely hard.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> The Minister of State will be aware of the extreme weather events we have had since November 2015, including storms Clodagh, Desmond and Frank. It has been an unprecedented time of adverse weather events. Will the Minister of State pass on my gratitude to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for his Department's response to those who were affected by the floods and for the response of the Defence Forces in particular for its help to many households, businesses, towns and communities right around the country? I acknowledge the scheme that has been put in place for the first time to compensate business owners and ratepayers who have been adversely affected by the recent bad weather. One sector that has been particularly hard hit is our inshore fisheries fleet. They have simply not been able to put to sea since November. Under normal circumstances they expect bad weather at this time of year and they try to deal with it as best they can. They have been now tied up at the quays for almost seven to eight weeks without an income. As the Minister of State is aware, there is no social protection for these fishermen. The owners are self-employed and those who work on deck are self-employed share fishermen. There is no fishing or catching and, more specifically, there is no income. Many are now facing very serious financial consequences because of the weather events.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> One of the issues, which the Minister of State may be aware of, is that the quota system, which allows the inshore fishing fleet to work, is operated on a monthly basis. It puts extreme pressure on fishermen to catch the quota of fish within a calendar month. It sounds a bit archaic and somewhat anomalous that one has to catch the fish within a calendar month. If the weather does not allow this, in many cases the quota cannot be rolled over to the following month. The knock-on effect on fishermen is that they put to sea when they would be advised not to and so take risks. It is a dangerous occupation at the best of times but if they are under financial pressure as a result of adverse weather and if there is fish to be caught and rather robust prices as relatively little fish is being landed, the temptation is real and leads to extreme danger.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> I call on the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to give serious consideration to the administration of a compensation scheme through BIM for fishermen who can prove they have really suffered financially because of the adverse weather. A precedent has been set by the flood victims, particularly by the introduction of a grant scheme for ratepayers. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is unable to attend today and has asked me to reply to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> It is important that the fishing industry takes every precaution to avoid risk of injury or worse during storms and has full regard to local weather warnings before venturing to sea. I think we are all agreed on that. Inshore fishermen who may be experiencing financial difficulties while ashore due to the adverse weather should contact the Department of Social Protection which offers income support payments, subject to certain eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> In May 2014, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, announced the establishment of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum based on a structure of regional inshore fisheries forums to give inshore fishing communities a platform to become involved in policy formulation and decision making. The NIFF will be meeting for the sixth time on Thursday, 21 January 2016, and has invited the Department of Social Protection to discuss social protection policies relevant to the inshore fishing sector. The new seafood development operational programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was adopted by the European Commission in December 2015. That programme provides a comprehensive range of supports for the seafood sector, including a dedicated scheme of supports for the inshore sector to address the various economic and sustainability challenges facing the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> Last Thursday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was pleased to have the support of the European Commission to launch the initial tranche of eight schemes at the Government press centre. These eight schemes include the sustainable fisheries scheme, which makes available up to €16 million to encourage practices that lead to reduced catches of juvenile or over-quota species with the ultimate aim of improving fisheries sustainability. The inshore fisheries conservation scheme will make €6 million available overall. The initial phase of this scheme is a specific initiative providing up to 75% of market price for lobsters which are v-notched and returned alive to the sea to contribute to maintaining the lobster stock. The fisheries local development scheme will provide up to €12 million to local groups who establish fisheries local action groups and prepare local development strategies to identify economic development needs and opportunities in their fishing communities and in turn provide financial supports to local sectors to develop business opportunities and infrastructure to deliver on that potential. The sustainable aquaculture scheme will provide up to €20.6 million to support investment to promote the sustainable growth of output, value and employment in the aquaculture sector. The knowledge gateway scheme will provide up to €8.2 million to support applied research, training and the provision of environmental and business planning advice to the aquaculture sector. The seafood capital investment scheme makes up to €13 million available for capital investment by seafood processing enterprises to focus on reducing energy costs, improving safety, health, hygiene and traceability and also adding value through processing, presentation and packaging.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The seafood innovation and business planning scheme makes available €7 million to support investment to enable entrepreneurs and seafood companies to innovate and grow business and to build capability in the sector through improved leadership, as well as management and business planning practices. Supports will be focused on new product and technology development, research and development and business planning. Finally, the seafood scaling and new market development scheme makes available €4 million to support investment to promote scale and collaboration in the sector and to fund projects that address key sector issues such as industry collaboration forums, joint ventures between companies, producers and processors and projects that address common sector issues. The inshore fishing sector is eligible for and will benefit from the implementation of many of these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_628"> The Government is fully committed to the seafood sector and the coastal communities that are dependent on fisheries and aquaculture. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has provided almost €36 million in 2016 to his Department and a range of implementing agencies to begin implementing the new seafood development programme. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has also provided Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, with €22 million in 2016 to implement these eight schemes, as well as other new schemes that will be announced over the coming weeks and months.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">I thank the Minister of State for her response. I note that what was not read into the record from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine's report to the Dáil was the establishment in the near future of a mutual fund based on funding from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF. I congratulate the Minister on achieving a €240 million fund for the fishing sector over the next five years and I understand this is twice the size of the fund that was available over the course of the last Common Fisheries Policy period. In the aforementioned report, the Minister mentions this fund will be established to assist inshore fishermen who will be adversely affected through climatic or weather events in the future. In light of that part of the Minister's response, I ask the Minister of State to make a case to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding fishermen who already have been affected. I ask that the Department should consider in good faith how this fund should be established and how contributions will be made to it. However, in effect, I seek some compensation to be made in advance of that to support fishermen who were hit really hard in 2015 and the early part of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> In addition, I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to allow for administrative roll-over of quota from those months that were affected, that is, November and December 2015 and parts of January 2016, for those fishermen who were unable to catch the quota allocated to them. I ask that the quota be rolled over into the early months of 2016, perhaps up to March or April, to facilitate those fishermen who could not catch the fish they were allocated and to give them a chance to at least claw back some of the income lost during the storm events. A further small measure the Department could take, albeit one that would show good faith, would be a deferral of harbour charges for fishermen who were tied up at the quays for such a long time. While it would not make much monetary difference, it would show good faith and acknowledgement of the inshore fishing fleet, which has been badly affected. The Minister is even more aware of this point but it is no coincidence that this sector has been particularly hard hit and those in the fleet are practically on subsistence. For example, in respect of the recent controversy on the migrant non-national fishermen in the fleet, it is no coincidence that the vast majority of them are working in this sector or that such conditions are being experienced in this sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_633">To be brief, although I will relay the Deputy's concerns, I am not certain the Minister or any Minister in the Government can ask that. Most harbours now are controlled and governed by private companies or semi-State companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">They are few enough in number. In respect of the fund and the specific measures to support inshore fishermen affected by significant losses arising from adverse weather events, the EMFF and the operational programme provide for the establishment by fishermen of a mutual fund for adverse climatic events and environmental incidents, which when established, can provide aid to fishermen affiliated to the fund in line with predefined rules. The operational programme will co-fund the mutual fund, together with subscriptions from member fishermen. In that case, the viability of such a mutual fund is dependent on the extent to which fishermen commit to membership of that fund. Incidentally, the Minister will discuss with fishing representatives how they may establish this mutual fund over the coming year. As the Deputy rightly points out, it is important that people in this industry are not simply regulated, as they are but that also, in times of adverse weather conditions when they simply cannot work, they should be treated as would be all other industries, that is, when they cannot work there must be some safety net or fallback position for them. This is one step and there may be others because the Department of Social Protection has been invited to a meeting in the near future at which all these matters will be discussed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_636">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for allowing me to raise this issue. This is a simple case of bureaucracy gone mad and in so doing, it has affected the chances of the approximately 450 students of Coláiste Pobail Acla. This school is the product of an amalgamation in 2011 of McHale College, Achill, which had 450 students, and Scoil Damhnait, which had far fewer students. It is a fantastic school and is the only secondary school on Achill Island. However, prior to the merger, McHale College, the bigger school with more than 450 students, had been designated as a Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, school and therefore had the important advantages and supports that go with such a designation in respect of this successful scheme. After the merger, the DEIS status was removed and while the transitional supports for a DEIS school that is moving were put in place for the leaving certificate cohort of students, that transition has now come to an end. Nothing changed about the profile of the students or the economic position in the area, which had worsened considerably. All that changed was the name over the door and the roll number on the Department's roll, which appears to be where the difficulty lies. As no new DEIS status has been issued since 2006, the putting in place of a new roll number meant that DEIS status could not be extended to the new school, which I reiterate was the amalgamation of two existing schools. Mayo VEC, which had been the patron of McHale College, gave guarantees that DEIS status would be retained on the basis of assurances from the Department of Education and Skills. However, it was confirmed in July 2014, through the Higher Education Access Route, HEAR, programme, that the new entity was not in fact a DEIS school and was not entitled to the DEIS supports. When I questioned the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, late last year in this regard, she confirmed this and stated the transitional supports would be in place for six years.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> This is a crazy situation for a school with 450 students that had DEIS status but which merged, in the interests of educational opportunity, with a school that on its closing day had 30 pupils. The 450 students lost their DEIS status through no fault of their own and through no fault of the boards of management or the fantastic staff. It makes no sense and is a case of bureaucracy gone mad and of no one willing to take ownership of the issue. All the feeder national schools are designated as DEIS status, and the entire island and the community around it are designated as areas of high disadvantage, particularly in respect of rural disadvantage. I have consistently and constantly made the point that DEIS struggles to capture rural disadvantage in particular. This problem with DEIS, which is a fantastic programme, has extended through the lifetime of several Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> The Minister is reviewing the entire DEIS scheme at present and I note that another anomaly has arisen on the other side of the county, that is, in Inver national school, Erris. There are 22 national schools in Erris, all of which - with one exception - have been designated with DEIS status. The reason Inver national school is not so designated is the school did not apply in time. It has nothing to do with the profile of its pupils or with the disadvantage it faces. While I acknowledge the Minister of State will not be in position to provide it to me today, I would appreciate an update on that school.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> I reiterate this is a case of bureaucracy gone mad. All that changed here was a roll number. Nothing else changed but the students are now paying for that mistake.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">The staff are also paying for the mistake, although they continue to provide a fantastic education in spite of it. Will the Minister of State knock some heads together in the Department and bring some sense to the equation?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_641">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The school referred to by him is a new school which was established in September 2011 on foot of an amalgamation agreed to by the patrons of two existing post-primary schools, one DEIS school and one non-DElS school. I was not familiar with the issue before today, but it is something I will discuss with our colleague, the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who cannot be here.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> In line with current policy on all such amalgamations, the new school in question was not designated a DEIS school. Also in line with policy dating back many years, the new school receives certain additional DEIS programme supports in respect of the number of eligible pupils from the former DEIS school. These supports will continue until that pupil cohort has left the school. The Deputy referred to a term of six years, but they will continue until the relevant pupils have left the school. The Minister has addressed the issues raised in respect of the school in numerous parliamentary questions, while officials of my Department have also engaged in direct correspondence to clarify my Department's position on the matter. I clarify again that on no occasion was any assurance given by my Department to the school that it would be included in the DEIS programme following the amalgamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> As the Deputy is aware, last year the Minister announced a process for a review of the DEIS programme. This process is under way, with the majority of the work programme being undertaken during the course of the current 2015-16 school year. It is envisaged that a revised framework of supports will be in place for the 2017-18 school year. The overall scope of the review is to assess the existing DEIS programme in the context of evaluations to date and relevant policy and other developments in order to inform future policy on educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> The Minister invited all education partners to make submissions on their experience of the DEIS programme and suggestions for future interventions. The submissions are available on my Department's website and will feed into the overall DEIS programme review. I presume a submission was made on this case also. A technical working group within my Department is considering appropriate eligibility criteria to assist with the identification of the level of need in schools. This work is under way with a view to completion during the current school year. Any revised identification process for schools will be clearly set out and communicated to all schools concerned. </p>
            <p eId="para_645"> An advisory group has also been established. This group is reviewing the current supports available under the DEIS programme and will make recommendations for a new framework of appropriate supports, as well as a monitoring and evaluation framework. Socio-economic differences and the link with poorer educational outcomes cannot be viewed in isolation from the broader social context. The Minister has, therefore, established an interdepartmental working group to ensure a more joined-up and consistent approach to service delivery in the future. Representatives of relevant Departments and agencies are reviewing their current inputs to the DEIS programme and will contribute to the overall framework of supports to combat educational disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> Pending the outcome of the review process, the Minister does not intend to make any change to current DEIS policy. The policy predates the Government and has been in place for many years. That is the reason for the review of the overall policy. We will be able to see where we can make relevant and needed changes. We consider it best to deal with the matter raised by the Deputy as part of the review of the overall scheme.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_647">I am disappointed with the reply. As I have consistently said, this has nothing to do with school identification or the identification of need. It is not so much an amalgamation but a takeover. A DEIS school with 450 students amalgamated with a non-DEIS school with 29 students and the status was lost. Nothing changed in terms of the student cohort. If the amalgamation had not proceeded, the 450 students would continue to have DEIS supports. All that happened was a Department policy was pursued, which was to strengthen schools and go down the route of amalgamation. Assurances were definitely given. The minutes of board of management meetings are available. The Minister of State knows schools well enough to know that a board of management would not have signed up to something such as this unless assurances were given during the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> It is welcome that the DEIS programme is being reviewed. It is an important and successful programme, but in this specific instance there is a bureaucratic issue. The profile of the students has not changed. To use the Minister of State's own phrase, the "appropriate eligibility criteria" have not changed. In terms of identifying the schools and socio-economic differences, they did not change either. In line with what is happening in all rural areas, they have, in fact, got worse. It is beyond me why someone cannot knock heads together in the Department and point to the reality that nothing has changed except a roll number. As a result of the change in the roll number, DEIS status and all that goes with it has been lost. That is stupid and silly. I encourage the Minister of State to return to his officials and knock their heads together. On the basis of his timeline, it will be another two academic years before the supports kick in. There is no guarantee either of the result of what is a bureaucratic issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">The Deputy has stated again that assurances were given. I am led to believe by my officials that that is not the case. They are and have been very clear in the replies to parliamentary questions and on other occasions too that assurances were not given because it was not in their gift to give them. They are very clear on that point and they are usually right on these things. They are also very good at keeping notes, as the Deputy knows because he has also been dealing with them for a long time. They are very clear that there was no discussion at the time on the DEIS status of the new school. Strange as it might seem, they are very clear on that point. As I said, I have always found them to be correct in their reports on meetings to me as Minister of State and everything else we do also.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> It is not correct to say there are no supports available to the 450 pupils. I do not have the details of all the supports that are in place, but under the rules of the scheme, certain supports have been left in place for the number of eligible pupils. The Deputy said 450 students came from the DEIS school and that this would be recognised in the supports provided. I do not have the detail with me, but I will get it for the Deputy. However, I imagine substantial support is given to allow and cater for that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> The Department has to operate the scheme as laid out when it was first put in place many years ago. Everyone agrees that it is worth reviewing the scheme. That is why the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is the first Minister to say we should have a review and implement any change that may be recommended. The review is under way and it is hoped the new, revised scheme will be in place by 2017-18. An important element of the review is the development of a robust and transparent identification process for the inclusion of schools in any programme to support children at risk of educational disadvantage. That is our aim. All schools which meet the criteria for inclusion in any given programme will be included. I assume and hope a submission has been made on behalf of the school in question by the Deputy and others as part of the review process. Certainly, there will be ample time to discuss it as matters move along. </p>
            <p eId="para_652"> As previously stated in replies to parliamentary questions and other discussions, the review process is under way. There will be no changes to the current scheme, including the addition of new schools, until the review has been completed. It is important to note that, in the meantime, schools established following the amalgamation of a DEIS school and a non-DEIS school, including the school in question, will continue to receive certain additional supports under the DEIS programme in respect of the pupil cohort from the former DEIS school. In this case, 450 students attended the DEIS school. The supports include financial assistance in the form of a DEIS grant and access to home-school-community liaison and school completion services. It is wrong to say there is no recognition of the issues involved or that there are no supports available. The scheme has done its best to recognise that extra supports should follow pupils in the school. It is probably not the full complement of supports a DEIS school would receive, but it was not within the gift of departmental officials to recognise it as a DEIS school under the scheme started many years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">With the agreement of Members we will deal with the fourth Topical Issue matter from Deputies Gerry Adams and Ruth Coppinger, regarding the ongoing eviction of up to 70 people from a halting site at Woodland Park in Dundalk, County Louth. The Deputies have four minutes in total to make an initial statement and the Minister of State has four minutes to reply. The Deputies have two minutes in total for a supplementary statement and the Minister of State has two minutes for a concluding statement. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_381">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_660">Tá mé buíoch as an seans caint ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Last Friday and with only 48 hours' notice, Louth County Council began a process to evict 23 Traveller families from a halting site at Woodland Park in Dundalk. This was a shameful action. Those evicted included at least 22 children, some of them babies only days old, and two pregnant women. The distress and trauma caused to these families, especially to the children, was unnecessary and unreasonable. This was done without consultation by councillors.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> I raised the issue of the halting site with the chief executive of the council in November. I was on the site in December and made representations during Christmas week to the council and other agencies. The basis on which the council said that it carried out these evictions was a fire safety inspection. However, Louth County Council, like all other councils, was given a programme to review fire safety and Traveller accommodation last December. This was initiated after the tragic fire at the halting site in Carrickmines which saw ten people including five children die. The report is very clear that nothing in this fire safety review process is intended to be used to address the broader Traveller accommodation issues in a negative way. However, this is exactly what the council is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> The last five families at the Woodland Park site are being evicted today and tomorrow. Some of the women, including at least one pregnant woman, have had to sleep in a car for the past three nights. There is already a homelessness crisis in County Louth, with 5,000 people on the housing waiting list. The chief executive's action has added to this crisis. I ask the Minister of State to intervene and that he urgently agrees to release the necessary funding to upgrade the Woodland Park site. This is the most cost-effective and common sense resolution to the issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_382">
            <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_663">I also want to raise the issue of the eviction of the 23 Traveller families from Woodland Park in County Louth. It is incredible that the first response of the State to Travelling people since the tragedy at Carrickmines is to use that event to evict 23 families, including women and children, from a site on which they have been living. Just so we are clear, this was a halting site in the past. It is not as if it did not function in that capacity before. As we know, there is a housing emergency which even the Government is beginning to acknowledge. For Travellers it is doubly difficult, even if they want to access private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> It was thought necessary for the Garda public order unit to arrive on-site on Friday, only two days after the eviction notice had been posted up. It is very unusual to see a council moving so swiftly to do anything. The council did not feel it necessary to send a delegation to the site, engage with the Travellers or find out what health and safety issues there might be and how they might be rectified. There is no necessity to evict these families from the site to make it safe. All of these safety issues could have been addressed while leaving them <i>in situ</i>, and that was the stated aim of the report that followed Carrickmines. The directive said that nothing in this process is intended to be used to address broader Traveller accommodation issues in a negative way. Instead, these families are being pushed into the settled community against their wishes. That is not meant to be a policy. It involves breaking up extended Traveller families and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> That was the action of Louth County Council on the coldest night of the year. The Minister of State should condemn it. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly has been asked to intervene by Pavee Point and should do so.</p>

          <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_383">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Paudie Coffey)<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_666">Louth County Council has informed me that the Woodland halting site in Dundalk was a purpose-built permanent and transient site. However, it has been vacant since 2007, when the last of the two occupants of the site at that time were accommodated by the construction of two dwellings in a group housing site at the edge of the site. The illegal occupation of this site has been ongoing since April of last year and the inspection of Woodland halting site, which gave rise to the eviction of the families last Friday on safety grounds, was conducted prior to the commencement of the review process and the publication of the project initiation document and the <i>Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation</i> which was commissioned by my Department after the Carrickmines fire. Legal advice was obtained by Louth County Council and junior counsel appointed. A complaint was subsequently made to An Garda Síochána, which served the notice to evict. Gardaí enforced the direction by moving caravans on Friday last, 15 January.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> Since the site was occupied last year it is unclear who, in fact, has been in occupation. However, I understand that recent events have indicated that there were 28 temporary dwellings on site, occupied by 18 households. The original site has been significantly vandalised and requires substantial works to bring it back to a habitable condition. Numerous requests were made by the council over recent months that the families should leave the site but these were ignored. Recent Louth County Council Traveller accommodation programmes have not identified a demand for halting site accommodation at this location. The current Traveller accommodation programme 2014 to 2018 includes only one household which had indicated a preference for Traveller specific accommodation among all forms of social housing support available.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> Louth County Council has been actively engaged with the families and their representatives to try to meet their short-term accommodation needs, while also scoping and planning for meeting their Traveller specific accommodation needs in the medium to longer term. Louth County Council met yesterday afternoon with representatives from the Travelling community concerned with Woodland Park. A number of short-term solutions were discussed and agreed at that meeting and the council is committed to continue working with the representatives of Woodland Park towards a longer term solution. At the meeting yesterday evening, a number of short-term solutions were offered which also focus on a review of the Traveller accommodation programme. To that end the council is facilitating all households and families who wish to make applications to be considered for housing or to amend their accommodation type choice. A letting agent has been appointed to assist in the sourcing of private rented accommodation. It appears that many of the households were in the private rented sector prior to their occupation of the site. Also, the council has offered to accommodate households in alternative halting sites in the county which are vacant or semi-vacant.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> The local Traveller accommodation consultative committee has been convened to meet tomorrow to commence the review of the Traveller accommodation programme. The council is also commencing the capital appraisal of the Woodland halting site with regard to potentially developing it as a permanent Traveller-specific housing project and has planned meetings for the next number of days with potential partners who may assist in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> The agreement reached between Louth County Council and the Traveller representatives on Friday, 15 January remains in place, and is the central focus of the work of the council in respect of Traveller accommodation. I am satisfied that Louth County Council is committed to working with the Traveller families and their representatives to ensure the provision of accommodation of their choice in which they can feel safe.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_671">I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's answer. There is no point coming in here and reading a prepared script on an issue he knows nothing about. I asked him whether he would intervene to ensure the money which the Government has supplied is made available to refurbish the halting site up to appropriate health and safety standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> Louth County Council is not working with the Traveller families and their representatives to ensure the provision of accommodation of their choice, as the Minister of State indicated. That is not the case. I want to remind the Minister of State that last year, the Minister of State with responsibility for equality promised that Traveller ethnicity would be a reality. The Government also promised equality and social inclusion for the Traveller community. Given it was the coldest night of the year, can the Minister of State stand over and justify the forced mass eviction of these families, comprising up to 70 people, with some of them now on the side of the road?</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> The way to sort this out is common sense and is cost-effective, as the money is within the Minister of State's Department, and that is to have the site brought up to health and safety standards and then to work out with the Traveller people in that constituency appropriate tigíní or other accommodation in keeping with their cultural needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_674">I have heard replies in my time but I have to say this takes the biscuit. First, the Minister of State told us the reason the council acted in this way was that the directive was issued before the Carrickmines report came out. That is unbelievable. The Carrickmines report has been known for weeks and should have been respected. It is pathetic. It was said that numerous requests were made by the council over recent months for the families to leave the site but these were ignored. That could be because they have nowhere to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> The Minister of State has the brass neck to tell us there is no demand for Traveller-specific accommodation in County Louth and that everything is hunky-dory for Travellers in County Louth. These families are living proof that there is a huge demand for accommodation, in particular Traveller-specific accommodation. Is the Minister of State seriously suggesting they just did not bother registering their interest with the council? We all know of the failure of successive Governments and councils to accommodate Travellers in any sensitive or meaningful way - I saw this myself in the 11 years I was on Fingal County Council and it is no worse or better than any other council. Travellers have been utterly failed by this State. Now, we have a situation where 23 families are homeless and where the Government has added to the homeless lists. I assume those 23 families will have to be accommodated in bed and breakfasts or hotel accommodation at huge cost to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> They could have been asked to comply with health and safety regulations and they could have been given the means to remain on-site until there was proper, permanent accommodation for them. Think of the money, the time and the energy that has been spent by the State and the Garda. All of that should have been and can be used to refurbish the existing Traveller site and provide them with long-term accommodation. I hope the Minister of State will ensure the representatives of the Travellers, who were ignored when they brought a lawyer with them, are now accommodated by the council.</p>

            <p eId="para_679">I also remind Deputies that Louth County Council, as the housing authority, is the responsible statutory authority in law for ensuring the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programme. I assure the Deputies that I, the Department and the Government are committed to ensuring that Traveller accommodation needs will be met in a safe and sustainable way. I also have confidence that Louth County Council will work with the Traveller families and all those concerned to ensure that the short, medium and long-term solutions will be found to the issues the Deputies have raised today.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> I also wish to put on record that safety has to be paramount. We need to offer reassurance that steps are being taken by my Department in the context of the review of fire safety programme in Traveller accommodation. Local authorities have been instructed to undertake site-specific appraisals and apply the appropriate fire safety measures in accordance with the approach and the recommendations of the guide to fire safety in existing Traveller accommodation. They are also required to submit an interim report on the progress of the review to the national steering group which was established to oversee the review process by the end of this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> I want to reassure the House that my Department will continue to work with the local authorities and the national Traveller representative groups to ensure the continued provision of safe and secure accommodation for Travellers, in accordance with their choice and through the comprehensive local and national collaborative structures which are already in place.</p>

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">Obviously, it is slightly awkward to split up a speech on what I regard as one of the most important pieces of legislation I have had the privilege to introduce to this House in my five years as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> As I indicated previously, the Public Sector Standards Bill is a new, robust and positive framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest, as well as providing for a streamlined and consistent approach to ethics legislation across the public sector. As I explained before the break, it draws on all the experiences we have had in the operation of the existing patchwork of pieces of legislation that deal with both national officials and elected representatives and local officials and representatives and it integrates them into one overarching piece of legislation. It also does two other important things. First, it draws from best international experience, and we have dialogued with the most progressive countries in regard to ethics to ensure we have best practice enshrined in this Bill. Second, we have, of course, had regard to the advices we have received from tribunals and from the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPOC, which has in many ways been overseeing the legislation that has existed to date. I should also acknowledge the work done by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which was very involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny. It is one of the innovations in this Dáil that has been very worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Of course, no legislation can eliminate corruption. However, this Bill will ensure there is a robust framework in place to ensure that conflicts are appropriately identified well in advance and controlled. For control and identification to be successful, it will be crucial that public officials can make skilled judgments as to what in their particular role and personal circumstances could give rise to conflict. In any of those circumstances, there needs to be clarity about these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> The role of commissioner in education and research, together with the strengthened code of conduct and statutory principles we are now laying out in law for the first time, will ensure that the consideration of standards is a significant factor for those performing public office. The publication of this Bill marks the culmination of the extensive programme of reform I have undertaken since 2011. Real and meaningful progress has been made so far, with the Freedom of Information Act fully restored and, in fact, strengthened and broadened from the original Act, and with overarching and clear legislation to protect whistleblowers, not only in the public sphere but in the private sphere as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The groundbreaking legislation to regulate lobbying is important and we expect to have the first report from those who registered as lobbyists later this week. Legislation also greatly expands the role, remit and powers of the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I now turn to the Bill before us and will go briefly through each Part. Part 1 contains preliminary and general matters, including, within sections 1 and 2, the Short Title and standard commencement arrangements and definitions. An interpretation of the expression “material interest in a matter” is provided in section 3, and the term “public official” is defined in section 4. For the purposes of this Bill, public officials are divided into three categories, namely categories A, B and C. These categories are set out and described in section 5. The meaning of the term “public body” is outlined in section 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Section 7 contains seven categories of declarable interests. Section 8 sets out the interests which are private declarable interests. Section 9 provides that nothing in the Act will prevent a person from being a candidate in an election for either House of the Oireachtas, a local authority, or the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> Part 2 contains three chapters. Chapter 1 begins with section 10 and provides for the maintenance by public officials of proper standards of integrity and concern for the public interest and the efficient and effective use of resources. Section 11 prohibits a public official from seeking or exacting from any person, other than the official’s employer, any benefit, remuneration, fee, reward or other favour for anything done or not done by virtue of his or her employment. Sections 12 and 13 provide for the <i>ad hoc</i> declarations that are required of public officials where a conflict of interest arises. Section 14 prohibits a public official from using confidential information obtained in his or her capacity as a public official to improperly further, or seek to further, his or her private interests or those of a connected person. Section 15 prohibits members of local authorities from acquiring or disposing of land or dealing in any professional capacity with land during their term of office and for two years afterwards in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Chapter 2 contains four sections, sections 16 to 19, which set out the obligations on public officials to furnish evidence of compliance with the taxation Acts. Chapter 3 concerns what is termed "disclosure of interests". Section 20 makes provision for the determination of whether a public or private declarable interest is a declarable interest at any time during the declaration period. Section 21 sets out the obligations on category A and B public officials to provide a declaration of interests. Section 22 provides for the declaration of certain interests by category C public officials. I believe this is the right approach and I am interested to hear the opinion of Deputies on the other side of the House in terms of not placing the same onerous level of responsibility on everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Section 23 provides that an official shall not be required to submit a declaration statement if there has been no significant change during that period and no <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures have been made. Again, this section is to prevent the need to repeat the same declarations over and over. Section 23 also empowers the commissioner to determine the format and means whereby statements of declarable interests are to be furnished, thus allowing for the development of an online declaration system to be considered in due course and I expect we will migrate to that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> Section 24 provides that statements and <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures furnished in accordance with the Bill will be retained for 15 years. Section 25 provides that certain documents and information regarding the appointment of a special adviser to a Minister or Minister of State must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Part 3 contains six sections. Section 26 provides for the establishment of the office of the public sector standards commissioner and the position of the public sector standards commissioner and provides for the functions of that person. Section 27 provides for the dissolution of the Standards in Public Office Commission. At this juncture, I believe most Members would like to join with me in publicly acknowledging the work of the commission to date and in thanking the members of the commission for their dedication and commitment in carrying out their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Section 28 provides for the appointment of a deputy public sector standards commissioner. Section 29 provides for the issuing of advice by the commissioner to a person to whom the Act applies regarding steps that could be taken by the person to comply with the Act. Section 30 provides for the development by the commissioner of a model code of conduct applicable to all public officials. Section 31 provides for the preparation of annual and other reports by the commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Part 4 contains six chapters. Chapter 1 contains section 32, which provides a list of offences. The criminal sanctions for non-compliance with the Bill are robust in nature and will act as a strong deterrent against the commission of offences by public officials. Chapter 2 deals with complaints. If a person considers that another person has contravened a provision of the Act, he or she can make a complaint to the commissioner under section 33. Section 34 provides for the dismissal of complaints by the commissioner in certain circumstances. Section 35 permits the commissioner to request a member of staff to carry out a preliminary inquiry into a complaint, and makes provision for the conduct of preliminary inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Chapter 3 deals with investigations by the deputy commissioner. Section 36 provides for the referring of a matter to the deputy commissioner for investigation where there has been a complaint made alleging that a contravention of the Act has occurred. An investigation may also be requested in the absence of a complaint, where the commissioner is of the opinion that the Act has been contravened or it is in the public interest to have such an investigation. Section 37 permits the deputy commissioner to appoint investigation officers and makes provision for the conduct of investigations. Section 38 sets out the powers of the deputy commissioner. Section 39 requires the deputy commissioner to prepare a report of the investigation and furnish it to the commissioner. This section also makes provisions for the actions that may be taken by the commissioner on receipt of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Chapter 4 contains section 40, which provides for the conduct of an oral hearing procedure by the commissioner and for the commissioner to make findings of fact at the conclusion of an inquiry. Chapter 5 concerns miscellaneous provisions relating to Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and contains six sections. Section 41 provides for the privileges and immunities of witnesses and also concerns liens and expenses. Section 42 provides for the absolute privilege of documents, reports and statements of the commissioner, deputy commissioner, an authorised official or an investigation officer. Section 43 provides for admissibility of certain evidence gathered in the course of an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Section 44 provides the commissioner with powers relating to the discovery of documents. Section 45 provides that a person is required to preserve a relevant document or information related to an inquiry, investigation or hearing or intended inquiry, investigation or hearing until the process and any related proceedings are completed. Section 46 prohibits a person from disclosing information obtained by him or her in the exercise of powers conferred by the Act or by being present at a meeting or a sitting of the commissioner, the deputy commissioner, an authorised official or an investigation officer held in private, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Chapter 6 contains four sections. Section 47 sets out the actions to be taken by the commissioner following an investigation. Section 48 deals with the costs of persons appearing before the commissioner or an investigation officer. Section 49 provides for the award of costs by the commissioner against a complainant in certain circumstances. Section 50 makes provision for the preparation of a report of the commissioner as a result of an investigation, the publication of that report, and its furnishing to the relevant people. Where the report relates to a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, it shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Part 5 deals with the prosecution of offences, which are provided for in section 51. Section 52 concerns fixed payments orders which may be served by the commissioner when a person has failed to submit a declaration statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Section 53 describes the penalties on conviction. Section 54 makes provision for other consequences of a conviction for an indictable offence under this Act, namely disqualification from holding office as a public official or a particular category of public official. This section also makes provision for the suspension of a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas by the relevant House. This is the first time such a provision has been made, as far as I am aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> Part 6 contains four sections. Section 55 provides for sanctions that may be issued by the commissioner following a contravention of the Act. Section 56 makes provision for the suspension of a Member of a House of the Oireachtas from the service of that House for a period not exceeding 12 months. Section 57 provides for automatic disqualification of a public official from appointment to a position as a public official in the case of failure to be tax-compliant. Section 58 provides for the validity of acts of a public body not affected by reason of contravention or certain disqualification or suspension.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Part 7 of the Bill concerns the "outside appointments board". Section 59 provides for the duties of a public official regarding post-term employment once he or she has ceased to be a public official. The establishment of the outside appointments board on a statutory footing is provided for in section 60. Part 8 consists of six sections. Sections 61 to 63, inclusive, provide for repeals, the making of regulations and orders by the Minister and for expenses incurred in the administration of the Act to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 64 is a technical section dealing with the adoption of references. Section 65 enables any complaints made or investigations initiated before the commencement of this Act to be completed. Section 66 sets out provisions concerning the operation of Schedules 1 and 2. Schedules 1 and 2 set out the persons to whom statements of <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures and statements of declarable interests are to be made, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> A number of amendments have been identified for Committee Stage of the Bill in order to ensure that the framework proposed is as robust and as practical as possible. These include ensuring that complaints concerning the commissioner and deputy commissioner may be made and investigated, clarifying the power of the commissioner to order the production of documents, and changes regarding the issuing of tax clearance certificates as agreed in conjunction with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Additionally, further consideration will be given to the report of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform that was prepared following the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill I mentioned in the context of Committee Stage amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> I hope the Bill will receive broad support from the House. It is our duty to do our utmost to provide today’s citizens with a Government and a public sector that are an exemplar of transparency and accountability. I did an interview earlier today in which I discussed polling on confidence in the working - rather than performance - of government and public administration, particularly transparency. Satisfaction is rising but we need to continue working on that. I welcome the views of Members and particularly those in the Opposition on the provisions of the Bill. I have stated that from the outset of the process, the Executive and every Member in the Houses has a role to play in shaping what we do. I am open to any constructive suggestions from the Opposition on how the Bill can be further improved. I am delighted this final piece in the jigsaw of the suite of legislative measures that I set out in the programme for Government is finally before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 and I have listened carefully to the Minister's comments. As he has made clear, this matter was discussed as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill with the Oireachtas finance and public expenditure committee some time ago. There was a useful discussion in that respect and I hope our discussion on Second Stage will be taken into consideration in advance of Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> Most people agree it is good to have this legislation, which effectively consolidates local and national ethics requirements into a single piece of legislation. In reading through my notes and the Bill itself, the first thought coming to mind was that if right was right, everything in it should be happening anyway. We should be just putting into legislation what would be good practice. I read about everything that needed to be done, with people declaring conflicts of interests, etc., and I hope that a misinformed listener does not believe that this is not happening anyway while we are waiting for legislation to be enacted. The tone is of a belt and braces approach to good practice that we all hope and expect is being complied with 100% in all cases, although human failures can come into the process. That is really what we are trying to tie down here. I hope most of this will not be an undue burden on people as they should be doing what is prescribed anyway. I know there are technicalities in the legislation but the spirit of the Bill and operating with ethics to the highest standard should be paramount in everybody's thinking in the public service, whether they are elected officials or other public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> Much of my comment relates to clarification rather than finding fault with the legislation. I would like issues to be teased out and perhaps we will all be here again in a few months on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">Who knows? We will not go there with this one. The context of this Bill is addressing corruption risk through an appropriate disclosure of interest regime and the regulation of conflicts of interest, which is critical in maintaining trust in the reputation of public institutes. Trust is fairly high in Ireland and relative to other countries, we do not have a bad name. Perhaps the tribunals highlighted some very bad aspects but it is important to note they were the exceptions rather than the norm. Often the difficulty is that when there is an inquiry or tribunal, with the media picking up the highlighted aspects for headlines to be transmitted internationally, people might think it is what goes on in Ireland. They may forget that this is just one or two bad apples in the barrel. It is important to emphasise that we have a good reputation across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> This legislation deals with the provision and advice for the development of codes of conduct to be distributed among different bodies, and I will return to that later. The Minister covered some of the objectives of the Bill, although not precisely in the manner I will discuss. The Bill seeks a consistent, coherent and proportionate framework, which is important, as we can get bamboozled with forms. Public officials can also get bamboozled with such forms, and the senior officials in an organisation might be tasked with ensuring the task is done. When they land on the floor of a Department or local authority, it might be a case of "here he comes again, what is this all about now and what must we do?" The processes can be a little disproportionate and I hope people can be tolerant of personnel trying to implement these processes as part of a day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> It is interesting that we are replacing the Standards in Public Office Commission with a public sector standards commissioner. People might say it is just a name change but we are essentially broadening the remit of the work done by that commission, and the work will still need to be done. All Members of the House and people in other organisations will be familiar with that work. It is interesting that the commissioner will have stronger powers of sanction and enforcement with respect to a range of contraventions. The Bill will establish a more effective, streamlined and efficient process for the submission of periodic statements of interest. That is important as people may be in a job for a number of years while issues change, which means the original declaration may not tell the full story as time goes on. A periodic declaration is important for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> When we come into the Dáil we have to produce a tax clearance certificate on entry and I have already applied for mine as part of the preparation for the election. I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will deal with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I will not go there as a particular Senator in my county would not like to hear anyone talking like that. I think we know what we are talking about. I prefer if Revenue gives it to me anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> As I mentioned previously, this proportionate and graduated approach is very important because there are different levels of different aspects of declarable interest that must be declared by different people and it is important to do that. This establishes a new statutory board to address potential conflicts of interest when public officials take up roles in the private sector when merging the Outside Appointments Board for the Civil Service and local authority system. That is an interesting one. We know people should not go to an organisation and use the knowledge they had in the previous organisation. However, my opinion on this topic is probably slightly different from the current fashion. I believe in movement between the public and private sectors. Some people think it is a case of "public sector, good; private sector, bad". We have had lots of cases where people who worked in Revenue are probably now good tax advisers. People might say this is good or bad. I do not know. I think it is an open debate. It is not the closed debate that some people think it is. I have cited one example here previously. I can think of people who probably work in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and when their time comes after a period in the job, they could go on to work for the betterment not just of themselves but that of the company and Irish exports in the food exporting area. The knowledge they have gained in the public service should not be lost to the State but it is a question of how one manages it, particularly during a period of transition. I know some people think people should be almost sterilised, hosed down and put in quarantine for two years after they leave the job. I do not think that is fair either but I accept there can be conflicts and we need a system to deal with conflicts of interest. Sometimes good can result from people moving from job to job.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> I will turn to a point that was not addressed in the Bill. The Minister might say it is not exactly the point. One of the briefing notes we received said this ensures that conflicts between the public interest and private interests of public officials in the performance of their duties are regulated. I often ask the question about the conflict of interest between the public interest of one organisation and another public organisation. I know it is not something that is intended here but I think most Government Departments and most people in Government jobs and probably in the private sector as well have a silo mentality. I am not talking about any financial benefit but there can be a conflict of interest between two public bodies because they have a different statutory basis and look at different things differently. There might not be any financial benefit but there could be a financial loss to the State. I raise the point that conflicts of interest can arise between public bodies. I do not think the taxpayer should have to troop off to the courts and fund both sides of a debate while neither side wants to concede. This is an issue that always crops up when we talk about conflicts of interest between public and private interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> It also talks about a linkage between the quality of public institutions and the long-term economic and social sustainability of the country. This is important. Surprisingly, one of the agencies that has failed in this department over the years is the Central Bank. Public confidence in the Central Bank is very low and rightly so. We all know the Central Bank did not do the job so we will not rehash that. What should be one of the pillar institutions in any country, namely, the Central Bank, suffered a severe loss and the quality of that public institution was severely damaged. This is generally damaging to the public service and everybody connected with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> In these proposals, we talk about how we manage conflicts and reinforce standards. I like the reference to reinforcing the standards that are already there because it implies that they are there as we stand and that they are not just new requirements. It is also important to have an institutional framework for oversight, investigation and enforcement that is robust and effective. Again, I go back to the Central Bank and other organisations that failed completely in that area in the past and that have a lot of catching up to do to restore public confidence in how they carry out their work. Some people have confidence in how local authorities manage issues. Lots of people have a lower level of confidence in how public authorities do their work. Some people have confidence in the EPA in respect of the quality of its inspection regime and protecting the environment while other people feel that it is a bit too light in how it regulates licences it has issued. This issue comes up periodically in different places. There need not be a conflict of interest for financial gain. It is important that these people are up to the mark in terms of doing their job.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> We then talk about how we are going to have a public sector standards commissioner who will have increased powers. The deputy commissioner will be independent of the commissioner in terms of their investigatory function so we will have a commissioner and a deputy commissioner who will be independent in their investigatory functions. I worry about what will happen when you set up one organisation and divide it before you even start and say "you're number two but actually you are independent of number one". We must tease that out because, again, that was one of the problems with the Central Bank. It had a regulatory function and a consumer affairs function. When you set up an organisation and start dividing it in two from day one, it does lead to one side not wanting to know what the other side is doing and we go back to the silo effect about which I spoke earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> It is good that public officials will have to disclose as a matter of routine any conflicts of interest they may have. I spoke about how essential it is that people do not use any insider information. Again, we would take that as standard procedure generally in the public area.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> I had a look through the explanatory memorandum and a few thoughts came to me about the tax compliance issue and the public sector standards commissioner. We are to have a deputy commissioner. When the deputy commissioner is on leave or sick, retires or leaves the post, is there provision in the legislation for somebody else to carry out the duties of the deputy commissioner if the designated deputy commissioner is not there? This is something to be clarified on Committee Stage. Will it take six to 12 months to fill a post and will the entire organisation be effectively stood down if they cannot work during that period? I do not have to look too far to see where there was a gap previously in respect of appointing somebody to do a particular job. Could the Minister pick up on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Section 30 provides for the commissioner to draw up and issue a model code of conduct to guide public officials. This code of conduct is a guide and there are guidelines. I know one cannot be over-prescriptive from day one but it is important that they be very consistent across the different public bodies. Different public bodies will probably be given a template and told to amend it. I hope the commissioner will review the implementation of these guidelines to make sure they are carried out in an objective and consistent manner. It is no good being told "this office only has a policy function". I get tired of hearing this. This means that we will dream up the idea and if it does not work, nobody implements it and everybody ignores it, it is not our fault. This is the Bart Simpson response that one often gets in the public and private sectors so it is important that somebody actually does monitor it, training and manuals are introduced, staff are brought in and shown how to work it and yearly meetings take place in respect of its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Interestingly, the commissioner will be able to make inquiries regardless of whether an objection has been received from a member of the public. There will be a procedure for an oral hearing, which is set out in section 40. This is important because sometimes an oral hearing can achieve far more than all the written submissions people care to deal with. As Deputies, we know that sometimes when there is a hearing involving an appeals officer from the Department of Social Protection and the person who may have been refused a payment, one can achieve more in that half hour and the person sees the people who are directly involved. It is a bit like being in front of a judge. They get a feel for the person with whom they are dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I will now turn to sections 42, 43 and 44. Section 44 talks about how the commissioner will have powers relating to discovery of documents. I want to ask a question that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The issue of confidentiality of documents arose in respect of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, inquiry where the receiver, paid for by the taxpayer, doing his job as he saw fit did not pass information to another taxpayer-funded organisation which ran the inquiry and the judge put his hands up and said he had a problem. He asked for somebody to act as referee and give him the powers to do what everyone knew he needed to do. That is an acid test if somebody cites confidentiality in respect of documents. Will the deputy commissioner have the power to go any further? Where will he or she go in that situation? Will he or she go to the High Court? That needs to be clarified at the beginning because there is no point having legislation if when some people have a problem with an investigation, they claim confidentiality and scupper the whole procedure. </p>
          <p eId="para_732"> There will be powers of suspension if a Member of the Oireachtas contravenes this legislation. This is a new area and will probably require constitutional clarification on Committee Stage to ensure it is safe. Notwithstanding that a report will have been done and laid before the Dáil, there would have to be a mechanism in the Dáil if a Member is to be suspended. It cannot be that the report is lodged in the Oireachtas Library and there is a vote to suspend the Member. The Member is entitled to state his or her case in front of his or her peers. The commissioner may not be right in every adjudication. Will there be a second, parallel inquiry in the House, as was talked about years ago in the Judge Curtin issue? I do not know if that was before my time here.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">It was sorted out at the last minute. Where stands this Bill in respect of people's right to elect a person of bad repute? They are entitled to elect such a person if they choose to. That is democracy. Some might say that thumbing a nose at the system is a good thing, others might say it is outrageous that somebody should have the cheek to do that and the person should not be here. That depends on one’s political perspective. I would not like to see a high-handed approach being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> I am impressed with section 6 and the definition of public bodies. I was scratching my head to know if anyone was left out. There may be some but we can clarify that on Committee Stage. Section 6(1)(j) refers to “a body that is wholly or partly funded, directly or indirectly, out of money provided by the Oireachtas or from the Central Fund or the growing produce of that Fund and in respect of which a public service pension scheme exists or applies or may be made;”. That should catch most organisations. Are there any in the grey area that are not fully caught by the public service pension scheme but that could be funded or partly funded by the Oireachtas or the Central Fund? Does “partly funded” refer to one year? Are annual activities partly funded or is it a once-off payment for an organisation? For example, will a private sector nursing home, 90% of whose clients are in the fair deal scheme, funded almost exclusively by the taxpayer, under contract with the Health Service Executive come under this definition? Another example is a company whose main business is to build schools which continue in good or bad times under the schools building programme. There are some companies substantially funded by the public purse on a permanent basis, notwithstanding that they are involved in capital projects. The annual operating revenue of some of these contractors is public money, notwithstanding that they are in the private sector. We will want that clarified as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Sections 16 to 19, inclusive, refer to tax clearance certificates. Under section 19(5)(b)(iii), “... the Collector-General shall notify the Commissioner in writing of the refusal and the Commissioner shall draw up and publish a report in writing in relation to the matter.” I had always understood that there was a degree of confidentiality about a person’s dealings with the Revenue Commissioners if a person did not get a tax clearance certificate but this legislation covers many people and requires that this should be published. Is it not enough to notify the particular appropriate person? What is the format of publication? Will there be an advertisement in the Sunday newspapers or will it be on the website of the commissioner’s office or who will publish it? Is it right that a person’s tax affairs or those of one connected to that person may be published?</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Under section 50(1), where there is a contravention of the Act, the commissioner may furnish the report “to such other persons as the Commissioner may consider appropriate”. How widely will that be circulated? Some commissioners might think it is in the public interest to issue a statement to the national media but, some might think that is certainly not what was intended. I do not know how broad that provision is and I would like it clarified. This will cover Members of the Oireachtas and Members of the European Parliament. Under section 50(4) a report “shall be furnished to the President of the European Parliament”. What jurisdiction does an Irish body have in respect of the President of the European Parliament? Maybe this is a standard procedure or maybe there is a reciprocal arrangement. What happens if an Irish MEP does something wrong outside the jurisdiction of the State? Is the President of the European Parliament obliged to inform the commissioner at home? I do not think MEPs should be exempt from this legislation but I want to understand the jurisdiction of the European Parliament in respect of Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_738"> We may want to tease out further the suspension of Members of the Oireachtas on receipt of the report to ensure it is appropriate. During that debate we should also debate the fact that a person who is declared bankrupt cannot be a Member of the Oireachtas. We inherited the system from England and the House of Lords which represented people of property. It was all about money. One can be a paedophile and be a Member of the Oireachtas. I have a problem with that. There was a time when being bankrupt was a mortal sin but many people, through no fault of their own, have had to go bankrupt. We have introduced legislation to make it easier for people to go bankrupt.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I would like to see a bit of consistency with the gravity of the situation because I agree with proportionality and the graduated approach in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> The Schedules to the Bill deal with categories. Category A refers to persons to whom people are to refer reports. It deals with Deputies, MEPs, the Attorneys General and special advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">According to the Schedule, the chief executive of a local authority, the person to whom the statement on an <i>ad hoc</i> disclosure is to be furnished, is the cathaoirleach. I wonder about this because, in the normal rankings, in some counties the cathaoirleach is only in office for one year. He or she is only getting into the swing of things when he or she has to move over to allow a party colleague or somebody else from another party to become cathaoirleach. It should be remembered, therefore, that an individual will not be in the position of cathaoirleach permanently. Technically they are in place as volunteers. They are elected representatives and their filling of the role of cathaoirleach could be coming close to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Could this provision place an excessively onerous responsibility on a cathaoirleach? I wonder if another body such as the Local Appointments Commission could be involved. It is a little too close to the bone for a cathaoirleach to be put in what could possibly be a difficult position. In fairness to them, if cathaoirligh required legal advice on what to do, they would have access to it. As the Minister knows, there is never a shortage of money in local authorities to be spent if management wants legal advice, but a member dare not seek it or expect to have it paid for. Actually, the same happens in the Oireachtas. The Executive can receive all the legal advice it wants from the Attorney General, but if we ever ask to see it to challenge, verify or check it-----</p>

          <p eId="para_749">There are legal services to protect the institution, not to help Members. We deal with them at the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees all the time and they will advise on legal procedure. However, they have never been available to me to advise on whether legislation is legal.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">Perhaps the legal service needs to be beefed up next time. I have heard the Minister make that reference recently also, but in my experience it has never been available to assist us. It tends to state what a committee can or cannot do, including in guiding the banking inquiry, inquiries by the Committee of Public Accounts, or where we receive something from a whistleblower. It seems to give advice on compliance with existing legislation and how to defend it if the Committee of Public Accounts is before the court in the case of some witnesses. It gives advice of that nature, but, to my knowledge, it never gives us advice on legislation, although I stand to be corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> Schedule A.12 states any other person holding an office or other position is to give their reports to the prescribed person, whoever that will be. That phrase is used in the last line of all of the Schedules.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> The section on public officials in category C may affect some Members of the House. A person who is a member of a committee, joint committee or a joint body of a local authority, other than a member of the local authority, should make <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures to the chief executive of the local authority. The Minister might advise Members on this provision, many of whom are members of joint policing committees in their local authority areas. I received the form from the council the other day, but I was told I did not need to fill it in because I was a member of a joint committee. I presume that is right, but somebody might clarify if that will continue to be the case. We want to prevent a situation where people in categories A, B and C for different aspects will receive a multiplicity of forms. We should check how many will end up receiving a multiplicity of forms in order to make the process simpler.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Everybody in the House will welcome the Bill. We will entrust whoever will be in the next Dáil with the responsibility of completing the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">The publication of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 is to be warmly welcomed. It is, however, unfortunate and a great pity that the Bill will not come into force before the dissolution of the Dáil. It represents a lost opportunity by the Government to bring together both local and national ethics requirements which give effect to the recommendations of the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals. A commitment to enact such legislation was given by the Government in the statement of Government priorities 2014 to 2016. If I am wrong and it is, in fact, the Minister's intention to bring the legislation through all Stages before the Dáil is dissolved, he might let us know of his plans. </p>
          <p eId="para_767"> This is incredibly important legislation. Political and public institutions in Ireland, as in many other countries, face great challenges in ensuring both transparency and accountability. The general public, public servants and politicians alike should be concerned about standards in public life. I believe they are concerned about them. Our behaviour as politicians and that of public officials should be thoroughly scrutinised. The putting in place of ethics legislation that can put us, as politicians, and all other public officials under scrutiny can only be welcomed. It is important that this be done efficiently and comprehensively. It is clear that the current piecemeal approach has not given rise to best practice. In addition, it has not prevented the abuses we have seen and which loomed large for many decades. Some of this corruption, in various guises, has received extensive coverage in the media, most recently in an RTE investigation into potentially corrupt practices by public officials. Such incidents that have been prominent in the media may, of course, be just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
          <p eId="para_768"> The question arises, therefore, as to whether there is still a hidden, underlying layer or culture of corruption in the State. Does it persist to this very day? It is hard to know for certain, but there is a public fear or suspicion that that is the case. We do know, unfortunately, as a country and body politic, that we are not immune to corruption. It has been suggested by Transparency International Ireland that Ireland is highly vulnerable to corruption. It pointed to its own independent data and analysis, as well as the findings of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, when it arrived at this conclusion. The mechanisms in place for detecting corruption are clearly inadequate. We are not good at exposing corruption. It often remains for others such as RTE to bridge that gap and investigate and expose corruption. It is a job that surely should be the function of the State. </p>
          <p eId="para_769"> We have a poor record in holding those responsible for corruption to account. That lack of enforcement has been at the root of the problem in tackling corruption in Ireland. That view was echoed by the experts from whom we heard at the committee when we considered the heads of the Bill. Therefore, we need to reflect carefully on this issue. When many might have thought the days of brown envelopes were over, the recent RTE investigation into corruption in county councils showed that it was alive and kicking in some quarters, at least. Why would it not be, given that the greatest weakness in ethics legislation up to now has been the lack of enforcement? "Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time" is the old maxim, but it is very unlikely that someone would ever do time if he or she was caught. Where is the deterrent for those who are so inclined to take a brown envelope or a backhander? What is to discourage those who are so tempted from taking a backhander when it is most unlikely to have adverse consequences for them? In fact, as we have seen in the past, it has not inhibited some political careers. If one was super-cynical, one might argue that it might have enhanced some careers, but why is that the case? Is it political apathy? Despite all the talk of a democratic revolution, the reality is that we are only now, at the end of this Dáil and the Government's term, getting to grips with proper legislation, that could go some way towards addressing the failings of the piecemeal approach which has been adopted up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Declarations of interest, tax clearance certificates and election spending returns are all filed with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. I join the Minister in acknowledging its work during the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">It is only proper to do so. The commission oversees the implementation of the ethics legislation as it now stands. The commission has recognised the need for a single comprehensive Act to deal with conflicts of interests and ethics in public office. The commission in the past has recommended that ethics legislation be consolidated, and a clear set of principles should be set out, which would apply to all in public life, thereby giving absolute clarity to all, leaving no margin for error or misunderstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> A real dilemma and weakness for SIPO, apart from being hampered implementing disjointed ethics legislation, was that it could not initiate investigations. After the recent scandal involving councillors highlighted in the most recent RTE investigation and taking into account previous instances when councillors, Deputies and even Ministers were apparently accepting cash for favours, it will come as a surprise to many that the commission, as the statutory body responsible for compliance with ethics legislation, does not or did not have the power to initiate investigations into these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Furthermore, as it now stands the investigative process is quite cumbersome. For example, if a member of the public wishes to make a complaint about a local authority member, he or she would have to make the complaint to the ethics registrar of each county council. The complaint can then be referred to the county manager and the cathaoirleach of the council. Only after all local procedures have been exhausted and if the county manager and the cathaoirleach deem it appropriate, can it then refer the individual's complaint to SIPO. It is a circuitous route.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Local authority members must also provide a declaration of interest to the registrar every year, much in the same way that Deputies make annual declarations to SIPO. If Deputies and Senators have left anything off their annual declarations of interest, they are able to make supplementary additions. Any complaints against Deputies or Senators are made to the respective Clerks of each House. These complaints can then be referred to the committee on Members' interests for the Dáil or the Seanad, respectively. They can then be referred back to SIPO, which can investigate the complaint and decide whether to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> One of the complaints of SIPO is that while it can initiate its own investigations into Deputies or even Ministers, it can only do so if it has received a complaint. If no complaint has been received, no investigation can be undertaken. SIPO has described its current role as being reactive rather than proactive. Those who are tasked with investigating matters of complaint are plagued with a lack of resources, as well as not having the independence and the statutory powers to investigate abuses in public office.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I hope that the Public Sector Standards Bill, if properly resourced and implemented, will provide for a more efficient, organised, streamlined and clearly laid out structure of ethical behaviour expected from all public officials. I hope that the legislation in practice will prove robust and effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> We have been told that the primary objective of the legislation will be to provide a consistent approach to ethics legislation across the public sector in line with international best practice. Some of the key elements of the legislation are, for example, that it will provide a set of integrity principles for all public officials. In terms of disclosure by public officials, the legislation strengthens the legal obligation for disclosure of actual and potential conflicts of interest, which I welcome. Contrary to Deputy Sean Fleming's concerns, this is not about trying to hold people captive within the public sector. It is certainly not intended to limit people's opportunities or ambition, but it is to ensure disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. Any ethical framework must have that absolutely at its core, so I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> In addition, the legislation extends the scope of personal and material disclosures to be made by public officials. We should look further into the proposed categories of public officials and revise the current proposal that only the most senior levels of public officials make the widest disclosures. We will return to that on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> The Bill interestingly also proposes a single public sector standards commissioner. Initially, I was in two minds as to whether I would be in favour of a panel or commission similar to SIPO rather than having a single commissioner and a deputy. The membership of the standards commission has brought to it a wide range of experience and knowledge but on reflection I see the merit of a single commissioner. As with an ombudsman, the commissioner will be the go-to person. The buck will stop with her or him and blame or otherwise will not be dissipated among a committee. However, there is also merit in finding a mechanism which could draw on the talents and experience acquired over years of the members of the standards commission. Why not utilise this accumulated wealth of knowledge and experience in some way?</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I particularly welcome that the commissioner will be able to initiate his or her own investigations even if a complaint has not been made. That is critical. The proposed legislation allows for any person to make a complaint in writing to the commissioner. This is an improvement on the current position, whereby only specific categories of person can make complaints or have complaints made against them. However, there is a problem with the proposed method as to how complaints are made to the commissioner and we will be proposing at a later Stage other options and ways for people to make a complaint to the commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I particularly welcome the proposed increased powers of sanction and enforcement on a range of contraventions. As I said earlier, enforcement is the crux of such legislation and it has been severely lacking up to now. The way the current ethics legislation is laid out and the lack of sanction have led greatly, one suspects, to the ongoing and historical scandals and controversies with which, sadly, we are too familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> I do not believe the legislation is yet complete and it will require some tweaking and consideration. We expect at a later stage in good faith to be submitting amendments to the Bill, as we see the proposed legislation as a work in progress. I welcome that the Minister has indicated openness to that discussion. It is important legislation and we need to get it right. Deputy Howlin may or may not be the Minister at that stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">I doubt that.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Comprehensive ethics legislation is central to addressing corruption risk. Such legislation minimises the risk of it occurring. Having such legislation in place is fundamental to the quality of governance that we enjoy. It reduces conflicts of interest between the public and private interests of public officials. Crucially, it gives the public officials guidance and security in the performance of their duties. It should not be regarded as onerous but rather as a safeguard mechanism for public officials. It gives the public comfort and reassurance that these public officials are performing their duties with the best interests of the public in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Our recent history with the banking crisis, the scandal of brown envelopes and so on, showed clearly that failures in governance resulted in substantial costs to the State and we have paid dearly. Generations to come will also pay dearly under the yoke of the economic and social costs that were the consequence of bad governance and corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> It is unfortunate that this legislation may now be left for the next Government to enact. It is a pity that this opportunity has been wasted. Nonetheless I acknowledge the publication of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">If returned, as I hope I will be, I look forward to participating in the debate in whatever capacity and seeing this legislation put on the Statute Book.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_792">I warmly welcome the introduction of the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 as we all need to be part of the reform agenda. We also need to root out corruption in public life and public office, following the economic crash, the banking crisis and other scandals in the past few years which have damaged public life. It is also important that we put forward our own new ideas to develop standards in legislation. The majority of Members, across all political parties and none, are interested in making the cleaning up of public life a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> It is important that we have standards in public office and the public sector. As I have said before, there is nothing wrong with having a good old-fashioned public service. The State was founded with this ethos at its heart. Many people were good old-fashioned public servants who served the public. Sadly, however, some of this has been damaged in the past few years. We must go back to that ethos and the principles of serving the public. Whether one is a teacher, a garda, a member of the staff in the Oireachtas, a nurse or anyone else who works in the public service, when one takes on the job, one should put the public and the public interest number one. If we learn that lesson, it will enhance society and the State. We have seen in recent days, however, how this has slipped. I was disappointed with the shenanigans in a recent appointment to a public board. It should have been thought about more clearly. Appointments to State boards should be made on merit through a proper process and assessment, with independent arbitration. The best person, man or woman, should be selected to be put on the board to serve the people. Sadly, however, that did not happen recently. Again, the Government has taken a hit because of it. It is important that there will be a vote in the House on this matter later tonight. It will be interesting to see if Deputy Pat Rabbitte will be in the Chamber for the vote at 9 p.m. I will be watching with great interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> As an Independent Member, I would not support any Government if it was shown to be corrupt or promoted illegal activity. For years, we have seen how insiders have contaminated politics, while politicians of all parties have abused their powers. We need to look at the issue of political appointments. It should include the ending of the practice of a party in government putting its favourites on the boards of State bodies, appointing them to the Judiciary, the top ranks of the Garda and the Central Bank Commission. An independent body must be set up to exclude politicians from making such choices. This goes back to the issue of standards against political patronage and cronyism. They need to be rooted out to ensure we get the best people possible for such appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 proposes to enhance the existing framework for identifying, disclosing and managing conflicts of interest and minimising corruption across the public sector. The Bill seeks to move towards a risk-based system of compliance and a more effective institutional framework for oversight and investigations. It proposes the introduction of a public sector standards commissioner to replace the Standards in Public Office Commission to oversee a reformed complaints and investigations process, a measure I support. I attended the Standards in Public Office Commission information session in the AV room earlier. I commend its staff for their professional and objective advice on the commission’s guidelines. I hope the buck will stop with the public sector standards commissioner. I also hope when the appointment is made, that it will be made transparently and properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The measures in the Bill include the introduction of a public sector standards commissioner, as well as the establishment in legislation of a set of integrity principles for all public officials. Last week we had many smart alecks around this House when the Independent group produced its charter which included many of these principles. Now the Government is including them in legislation. The Bill will also provide for the strengthening of the legal obligation on public officials to disclose as a matter of routine actual and potential conflicts of interest. We have seen significant criminal acts in this area in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The Bill provides for the establishment of a more effective process for the submission of periodic statements of interests; the imposition of statutory prohibitions on the use of insider information; and the establishment of a new statutory board to address potential conflicts of interest as public officials take up roles in the private sector. This is a good vision for the future and the direction in which politics must go. Surely, we should have learned from all of the tribunals of inquiry and scandals. Having watched them for several years, I am not a huge fan of long-winded tribunals. I have also lost confidence in the commission of investigation process because such commissions seem to run into problems regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Perhaps I am naïve, but the bottom line is that if something is wrong in the public service or political life, what is wrong with calling in the Garda fraud squad to deal with the issue? It would save much money, make a lot of sense and one would have an independent investigation away from all politicians. If someone is fiddling the books, scamming or involved in bribery and corruption, it is the Garda fraud squad which should deal with the allegations. If a person is innocent, good luck to him or her. If he or she is guilty, he or she should be rooted out of public office. Such behaviour has damaged politics in the past. There is no use saying only a small minority of politicians are involved because all politicians are tarnished as a result. In my constituency 35% of the people do not vote because in their minds all politicians are the same, essentially they are on the take. That is damaging and stopped people from voting. It is sad when one sees people who are hurting, but one knows deep down that they will not vote in the next election. The damage has been done by corrupt politicians in the past. They have damaged not only themselves, their supporters and families but also public life. I hope, with the new blend of Deputies and Senators after the general election, we will have a good old-fashioned public service and honest politics. There is nothing wrong with hard work and honest politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> In respect of regulation, the Mahon tribunal noted certain interests posed particular risks from an anti-corruption perspective, including, in particular, gifts and access to inside information, as well as ancillary and post-term employment. We are referring to major gifts, not somebody who is doing a favour and receiving a pack of smokes or a bottle of wine in return. However, I should not say this as one is not allowed to mention the word “cigarettes” in this Chamber any more.</p>

Let us not get carried away by the nanny state brigade around this House. I met a doctor last week who gave me plenty of advice on different medical issues. He said much of the information coming from the so-called medical profession was inaccurate. I will go down that road another day when we are dealing with a health issue.

          <p eId="para_810">To return to the Mahon tribunal and the issue of regulation which is important, the tribunal concluded that merely requiring the identification of conflicts of interest was not sufficient to control the risk of corruption which they presented. Consequently, several of its recommendations sought to further regulate such interests. In this respect, it recommended that public officials be prohibited from accepting any gift in excess of a stipulated amount where it could reasonably be considered to be connected with their public office. We need to examine the aspect of regulation closely and consider sensible, common-sense regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> The Mahon tribunal observed that successful enforcement of conflict of interest provisions was a key element in ensuring their effectiveness. I am referring to the effectiveness of enforcement. The tribunal found significant problems with the existing enforcement provisions which it suggested weakened the ability of conflict of interest measures to control corruption in politics and public services. The enforcement aspect is an important consideration. The tribunal noted that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, was largely responsible for enforcing these provisions in the case of public officials who were officeholders. The provisions covering Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are enforced through parliamentary procedures. Again, there are issues about enforcement and complications have arisen in that respect, about which we are all aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> With respect to corruption risks and conflicts of interest, the final report of the Mahon tribunal states: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_813">Conflicts of interest are a root cause of corruption. A conflict of interest arises where an elected or appointed public official has a private interest which is likely to be affected by the exercise of his or her public powers. Logically, a public official is less likely to exercise those powers in the public interest when he or she is in a position to use them for his or her own personal benefit. [That is an important point.] Some of the inquiries conducted by this Tribunal involved such ... conflicts of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Also, in the case of other European states, it is noted that conflicts of interest for public officials, elected members and holders of public office involve tension between public duty and private interests. This occurs typically where an elected member has a private interest which could influence the public interest. I am referring to serious conflicts of interest, but there can also be minor ones. A conflict of interest does not necessarily mean corruption or fraud. However, it constitutes an abuse of public office for private advantage. There are different levels of conflicts of interest. When it comes to such issues, I am a big supporter of having a top class Garda fraud squad to deal with them and thereby save us all a great deal of money in not having such tribunals and much hoo-ha about not getting the terms of reference right for a commission of inquiry which results in our having to introduce legislation to amend them. Members of the public have issues to deal with and they want us to focus on the important issues of job creation, health, education, the economy and public services and to get on with dealing with the real aspects of our day job.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> On periodic disclosures, one of the sections covers directorships. Members must register remunerated directorships in public and private companies. A Member must also register any unremunerated directorship where the company or companies in question is or are associated with, or subsidiaries of, a company in which he or she holds a remunerated directorship. I noted this when I spoke to representatives of SIPO in the audio visual room and I then returned to my office to start to fill in the form. I am a director of the Northside Centre for the Unemployed in Coolock, Dublin 17. It is a voluntary position, but I am still required to register it. I take the opportunity to praise and commend the Northside Centre for the Unemployed on Glin Road for its excellent work in providing services for the unemployed and education courses and in helping, in particular, people living in disadvantaged areas. I have been involved in the centre as a voluntary director for more than 20 years and the people there do excellent work. A number of my colleagues, as local representatives, serve on its board. It is important that they are acknowledged and commended for their magnificent work.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I have mentioned the tribunals of inquiry and raised the issue of public servants. I say to all public servants, be they Deputies, Senators, those working in the Oireachtas, gardaí or teachers, that they should do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. If one is a public servant, one serves the public. If people were to do this, we would have fewer problems. If one meets a good teacher, one will see productivity level increase in the classroom. The same goes for a good community garda. I met one in my constituency recently and they have done good work in building relations with the community and young people at risk. These public servants are worth a great deal to any community. The same applies to civil servants and other staff in the Oireachtas. We should recognise and commend those who do a good job and also reward them. That is also an important aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> A number of my colleagues referred to the local authorities. It is an important aspect, having regard to some of the scams highlighted in television programmes recently. There is also the relationship between some of those in senior management positions and some councillors. There were times when I thought there was a conflict of interest and management was not standing up for the real values of public office. Some county and senior managers have their pet councillors and I found that if any member asked awkward questions, on many occasions he or she was more or less blanked. These managers should read the legislation and listen to the debate on it. They work for a county or city council and should treat all elected members equally and with respect. There should be no such thing as having a pet councillor simply because he or she does not rock the boat and no question of there being bold councillors who ask all the awkward questions about the estimates or about what is happening in Dublin Bay. I will not name the people involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">I welcome the opportunity to speak about this Bill. I have enormous regard for the public sector and those who work in it, with whom I have had the privilege and honour of serving in my teaching days and while I have been a public representative. There is an extraordinary level of commitment across the public sector, ranging from An Garda Síochána to the health service, as well as many others. I have huge admiration for those who work in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I welcome the Bill which is timely. As a Parliament, a Government and elected Members, we should never ever cease in our efforts to strengthen further the public's trust in public administration. There is no doubt that its trust has taken a hammering during the decades on a number of levels. There has been a focus, particularly on the political side, on how politicians have been seen to be corrupt.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Everybody has been tarred with the same brush, which is most regrettable. We must do more and work harder to strengthen the public trust in public administration and to make it real and more tangible for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I welcome the focus the legislation provides to direct our attention on this matter but not just in terms of corruption which I wish to move away from. I also welcome the move to encourage self-declaration on a more regular basis for all public service officials, elected and otherwise. That will be done by means of enhanced IT systems. That is a most welcome, proactive and progressive step to try to get where we want and continually to reassure people that we are not all corrupt and that people are dedicated and genuinely working to give a real service to the public. It is an honour to serve the public in any role, elected or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I also welcome the more proactive role of the proposed public sector standards commissioner. I spoke in the House previously in the context of the recent television programme. At the time I said I did not want to see the establishment of another quango but I appreciate that it is a case of replacing one body with another one which is more proactive. The legislation does not allow the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, to be as proactive as it could be. It is more of a reactive organisation. That is not a criticism; it is fair comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Recently, there was severe flooding in west Cork and all over the country. That provided us with an example of excellent public service and the public sector at its very best. Local authority members in particular and so many others were superb and went way beyond the call of duty. They were out in atrocious conditions at all hours. That was real public service and it was appreciated by the public. We can be very proud of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> The aim of the Bill is to strengthen public trust in public administration. In trying to bring about more accountability and transparency we must look a bit further because when one teases out conflicts of interest there are many more conflicts of interest that erode people’s perception of the public sector. Not enough managers and people with responsibility in the public sector, who have accordingly large pay packets, speak out and are accountable. We, the political class, act as the buffer between the public sector and management. That is evident at local authority level with councillors. We rarely hear county managers answering tough questions on radio or television by the media. I accept they answer to the elected members in the local authority. Neither do we see those responsible for roads or the health service coming out often enough, for example, to respond to questions on the trolley crisis. It is always the Minister who is wheeled out before the camera to answer the questions. If we are to enjoy enhanced accountability and transparency within the public sector we must see more accountability from management. Managers should be more accountable and give more answers to the people. Media appearances are one of the best ways of doing that. I would welcome that as a step towards strengthening public trust in public administration and not just leaving it to the political class, local mayors and the Government of the day to answer questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> In the context of conflicts of interest and at a time when we seek increased accountability and transparency I am confused by the role of unions within the public sector. Managers say they cannot do certain things because of unions. In effect, unions are taking a role in management. That is an area that requires examination if we are to strengthen public trust in public administration and to provide enhanced accountability. The situation must be more transparent. In my time as a public representative I have come across many examples. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was a former trade union official. I accept that unions have a role.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">My apologies. The Minister's father was. I do not denigrate unions but I am concerned about their role when it comes to management and how far they go in that regard. I heard a story recently about a nursing home in which HIQA recommended that patients were fasting for too long and should be given tea and a biscuit at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. in the evening. HIQA said they should not be given their last tea break at 4.30 p.m. in the evening but the unions objected to the change. That should not be the case if we are in favour of public service. We are talking about conflicts of interest and people not using public office for private gain. I do not say there is corruption <i>per se</i> but a balance must be struck. Such issues must be examined in terms of a wider discussion on the role of the public sector and standards therein. It is timely that such issues are discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Roads are a significant bugbear of mine and of many public representatives. For years I have tried to get local authorities to employ private contractors on a temporary basis to relieve flooding on roads, such as we saw in recent weeks. Considerable damage results when such work is not carried out. The reason is that unions will not allow management to hire private contractors to relieve flooding on roads. Such matters erode trust in the public sector and public administration. They cause difficulty and we must have more openness and transparency in the debate. We need further accountability. The legislation is a welcome step towards enhancing the public sector and working towards accountability. I very much welcome the introduction of the Bill. I hope it will be the first step in a process that will go much further.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_839">I thank my colleague for enabling me to comment on this very important legislation. The Bill is important for a number of reasons. The purpose of the exercise is to protect the general public and to restore public confidence in the public service in general. That is not for one moment to suggest that everybody who works in the public sector is in some way corrupt or susceptible to corruption, but it is necessary that people are protected whether they are public representatives or public officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Like other speakers in the House, I am one of those people who have had the pleasure and privilege of working with various public officials through the years who were the essence of good conduct and who ensured that the right decisions were made in the public interest. They were scrupulous in the way they applied their decisions. As time went by perhaps one or two people failed to observe the rules. I refer to both public officials and public representatives. That does not mean, however, that everybody is corrupt. There is a grave danger that we would go down the road of presuming that is the situation. That does a great deal of damage to the morale of those involved in serving the public, which is a very honourable profession whether it be as a public representative or public official. In many cases the suggestion nowadays is that everybody is corrupt. It is true that every aspect of society has been challenged in one way or another in the past 20 years. Every sector has fallen by the wayside in some shape or form but there are still a number of people who get on the hobby-horse and point the finger of accusation at someone else. Perhaps they themselves are not in a position to do that all the time either, yet the position remains that in order to generate public confidence in public service in general it is essential that we have strict rules and guidelines and that we do our utmost to adhere to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> Conflicts of interest are important and we do not attach enough importance to the issue. How many times have we known people to speak in a particular fashion on a subject, knowing well that they might have a conflict of interest, but it is not of such a nature that it requires compliance with legislation? The Bill before the House will enable people to be reassured that they are doing the right thing, which is equally important. Down through the years I, and everyone else, have come across countless cases where people spoke as if they had no interest at all in a subject but on closer examination it was found that they did have an interest but that only came to light afterwards, which is the sad part. We must ensure that the standards are adequate to protect public representatives, public officials and the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">To move away from a natural presumption that they are all, in some way, incapable of doing their job, corrupt, about to become corrupt or have been corrupt in the past, it is essential that where there is a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of natural justice or the course of business or there is a serious conflict of interest, there is retribution and action taken in the courts to ensure it does not happen again. From time to time, I have seen individuals, who were subsequently accused and found to be guilty, accuse other individuals in public. It is a very demanding area and it is very difficult to be perfect but we can try to provide sufficient legislation and protection to ensure that society is the beneficiary in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I do not want to go on too long, because I do not have much time left, but I will say another thing. The Minister very correctly brought in legislation on lobbying which was badly needed and which I am sure will stand the test of time. One should remember that lobbying takes various forms. When I was a member of a different body and was sitting around a table and expected to make a decision, I always felt it would be awful if somebody sitting around the table had a vested interest. Some people might make a decision on the basis that it is the right thing to do whereas somebody else might make it on the basis that it is the thing to do because he or she has an interest, which is where the conflict arises. It is also worth remembering that to lobby people to the extent that an incentive is offered is a criminal offence and has been for a long time. There is a tendency to overlook that. If I go to a public official or representative and suggest that it would be beneficial to him or her to follow a particular route, I am guilty of a criminal offence. We cannot allow that as it undermines our entire society. It is up to us to ensure that is how we apply this in the business we are in. Comments have been made about a recent television programme which showed a certain level of "perceived corruption", and I use the phrase advisedly there. It should also be noted that some of the public representatives interviewed clearly indicated that what was being attempted was a criminal offence and in breach of the law. We did not see that because it was not shown. When the public comes to a conclusion on issues of this nature and does not see something like that, I can understand how it comes to the conclusion it comes to if it believes everybody is corrupt. Not everybody is corrupt. Sadly, those who follow the rules very often feel that their views are not heard at all, their efforts are not recognised or they are not doing the right thing. </p>
          <p eId="para_844"> The other matter is public appointments. Much heat has been generated on that subject. From listening to some members of the Opposition, I wonder has it now come to the stage at which future Governments will have to appoint somebody from the Opposition in order to comply with the regulations as some people see them. It is a serious issue because if that is the case, the presumption is that Government is always crooked and the Opposition is always pristine. </p>
          <p eId="para_845"> In a small country everybody knows everybody and, sadly, from time to time, we have situations in which the finger of accusation can be pointed at people who are eminently capable of doing a particular job. They are above reproach, can do the job and would be entitled to do it in the ordinary course of events but, if it comes to pass that they know somebody in government, they will not qualify. That is a rather peculiar way of going about things. It is not the application of equal treatment. In my time in public life, I have had dealings with many people who were appointed by Governments in various ways and I have always found them to be honourable, straightforward and, as far as I was concerned, honest. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> I will finish with a particular bugbear of mine. In a previous Dáil, I was encouraged to leave the House on a regular basis - more so than anybody else in the history of the House, unless we go back for a very long time.</p>

          <p eId="para_848">I know. I resented being told that the issues of public interest I raised by way of parliamentary questions were not the responsibility of individual Ministers, which left me with no option but to submit a freedom of information request. I have a strong view on this - I believe that any issue of public interest which is subject to a freedom of information request should be answered in the House, without exception, because no public authority has the right to supersede the House of Parliament. The rights of Members of the House must be observed in every instance and if an issue is going to be the subject of a freedom of information request, it is entitled to be observed in the House. That same information should, without reservation, be brought before the House. I was reprimanded on several occasions because of that. I believe I was right and I will never come to the conclusion, or be encouraged to come to the conclusion, that I was wrong. If the parliamentary system had worked more effectively in the years we are talking about and all those questions that could have been answered in the House were answered in it, there would be much less need for inquiries or tribunals and much less cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> To those who sneer at the system of parliamentary questions as an expensive way to get information, I say that the House of Parliament is still the supreme authority in terms of obtaining information. I do not believe the House of Parliament is the Executive - the Executive is drawn from the House of Parliament. Some people want to change the way our system works, to reverse it so that the Executive becomes the servant of the House of Parliament. The Executive's role is to produce and propose and the role of the House of Parliament is to debate. If the Executive does not do its job in the way it should, there is a price to be paid. We all know that. </p>
          <p eId="para_850"> I congratulate the Minister for bringing the legislation before the House. I hope it is effective and open, and is seen to be open. I hope that, as a result, our society will come to the conclusion that all is not lost and that we are quite capable of doing the job we were given in our role as public representatives.</p>

I am not certain if I will be present then but I will take careful note of all the points made.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Deputy Fleming made a general point which was echoed by every speaker. He said that ethics should happen without the compulsory nature of legislation - it should be the natural environment in which public officials operate. Unfortunately, human nature requires us to sometimes ensure there is a legal framework and sanction for the minority of people who break rules of normal ethical behaviour. He also made the point that our regulation should be proportionate and I strongly agree with that. It links into the other point he made about movement from the public sector to the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">There is a balance to be struck because all Members are agreed on the need for the availability of movement. However, it must be done on the basis that nobody is looking to the private sector when he or she is still in the public sector and bringing a capacity to overcome the will of the Oireachtas by knowing an insider track for somebody. While this balance must be struck, I acknowledge it is difficult to so do.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The silo mentality is an issue on which Deputy Sean Fleming touched and it is being addressed through the public sector reform agenda. I will be able to deal with that issue when Members debate public sector reform. I agree strongly with him with regard to training and I will deal with the issue of the confidential documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Deputy Fleming also mentioned the suspension of Members of the House. A process is set out in the Bill regarding that sanction should there be an investigation, should that investigation find serious fault against a Member of the Oireachtas and should it be validated by a court. It will then be up to the Committee on Members' Interests of the House to make a determination as to whether that Member should be suspended because this would be the prerogative of the relevant House itself, be it this House or the other House, depending on the House of which the individual concerned holds membership. Members can go through this process in some detail. I also wished to make sure this provision reached out to the European Parliament in respect of its membership, as its policies and laws have a direct impact on Irish citizens. Consequently, the same ethical code should apply there and that is why reports can be presented to the President of the European Parliament under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> Deputy Fleming mentioned one further point on where the A, B and C categories might overlap and whether there is a difficulty whereby people may be obliged to make multiple declarations. The Bill is clear and I will make it even more clear in setting it out post-enactment, that is, if one is captured by a number of categories, one simply makes a declaration under the highest category that applies to one. In other words, if categories A, B and C apply to one, one is a category A declarer under that regime. Deputy Fleming also mentioned the deputy commissioner and wondered what would happen were the deputy commissioner to be ill. Under the legislation, the deputy commissioner is appointed from among the staff of the commission. He or she is appointed by the Minister after consulting with the commissioner. It is possible for the deputy commissioner to assign his or her role in an investigation to another member of the investigation team should he or she become ill during an investigation or some such event. Members can work out the procedures in this regard. They are normal procedures that would apply to any analogous body of this sort but that is a level of detail into which Members can get on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> Deputy McDonald again generally welcomed the provisions of the Bill. Unfortunately, she then anchored it all in a lost opportunity, as though this was the only ethics legislation the Government had presented to this Oireachtas. This has been a reforming Oireachtas although Members were largely focused, as was the nation for the last five years, on Ireland's economic collapse and, as a Parliament, as a Government and as a people, on working towards recovery as the prime objective. The reform side of that mandate was a critical<i> raison d'être</i> for the establishment of my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In addition, bringing in reform of the country's ethics framework to restore public confidence was an important part of the work the Government has both undertaken and delivered over the past five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> It is unfortunate that Deputy McDonald would not acknowledge this because she then dismissed all the incredible amount of work done by both the Oireachtas itself in pre-legislative scrutiny and external analysis and the work of my officials over the past five years in bringing in legislation such as the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act. That legislation encompassed the biggest expansion of the powers of the Ombudsman since the Office of the Ombudsman was created in the first instance. Similarly, the whistleblowing legislation provided for the first ever overarching protection of whistleblowers in both the private and public spheres. I believe Deputy Durkan mentioned the first reporting under the Regulation of Lobbying Act will take place in the coming days. It is groundbreaking, difficult and complicated legislation. Moreover, a huge amount of time, effort and debate went into the restoration of the Freedom of Information Act and the Oireachtas inquiries legislation was the anchor that allowed the banking inquiry to be held after the people rejected giving additional powers to the Oireachtas by way of constitutional amendment. More reform has taken place in the lifetime of this Oireachtas than in a previous generation and this should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> In many ways, this legislation is the final piece of the jigsaw. As I stated in my opening comments, Members now have before them the overarching legislation that links together everything else because it takes account of the tribunals, many of which were still being finalised in respect of their reporting in the past couple of years. The Bill also takes account of the dialogue the Government has had with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, in its various reports, as well as the dialogue it has had with international bodies to ascertain what best practice entails. The joining of the Open Government Partnership, which is a world body set up to examine standards in governance to build public confidence therein, has been an important part of all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> I will turn to some of the comments of other Members. Deputy Finian McGrath also welcomed the Bill, for which I thank him. He referred to the public sector standards commissioner and asked how that official is to be appointed. Section 26 provides that the public sector standards commissioner will be appointed by the President following a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas. Consequently, it is an open and transparent system analogous to the manner in which the Ombudsman is appointed. I imagine the same open recruiting system used for the Ombudsman also will be used in an open trawl of anyone who wishes to apply for the job, followed by vetting and then a final determination by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> Deputy Daly referred to setting out a new standards regime and that is very important because the bringing about of a cultural change is sought. One can do so much by legislation but a cultural change must be brought about. The Deputy also made a valid point about identifying officials. I have always taken a jaundiced view about the thousands of letters that go out signed by officials stating they have been directed by the Minister, as though the latter had any notion of the thousands of letters going out nominally in his or her name, and, in this context, Ministers are corporations sole. Under the new transparency regime in the Civil Service, clear responsibility is being assigned. I invite Members of the House to look at a new website, <i>www.whodoeswhat.gov.ie</i>, which identifies officials and their functions and will bring in greater accountability. I disagree with the Deputy regarding his comment about the trade unions. The idea that a management system would allow trade unions to determine at what time tea is served is a management failure, not a trade union failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">It is a failure and an abandonment of management, not a responsibility of trade unions. The trade union movement of course is tightly regulated by law.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> The final speaker was Deputy Durkan. I agree with him and thank him for stating one cannot tar everybody with the same brush. The idea that somehow, because corruption is identified, everyone in public administration is corrupt must be addressed. There is an irony in that the more robust and vigorous are our investigation procedures and the more corruption that is uncovered, the greater the perception of corruption there is. However, this is something Members must do.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> The final point I will make pertains to a point on which I agree with the Deputy, that is, the peculiar view that appears to be abroad to the effect that no matter how distinguished or qualified one is, if one has a political association one is disqualified from holding an office. It is corrosive of politics and public affairs if people perceive that one should not be associated with the political system, which is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> I look forward to debating all these matters in great detail later on Committee Stage. I thank all Members for their contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_870">That, pursuant to Standing Order 177, Standing Order 131 is modified to permit an instruction to the Committee to which the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments for which it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to sections 43(9)(<i>b</i>) and 95A(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 with regard to the mutual recognition of veterinary qualifications and in particular declarations of language requirements and to change the title of the Bill to take account of these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I request colleagues to facilitate us when we move onto the amendments. The first two amendments to be discussed will be amendments Nos. 1 and 51. They are quite technical amendments but in order to pass them, the Dáil needs to reconvene temporarily as a committee. We will then go onto Report Stage. I ask colleagues to facilitate us in doing that as I am told this is the proper way to do it. </p>
          <p eId="para_872"> Perhaps I should explain what we are changing because, as it happens, it has nothing to do with horse racing. Amendments Nos. 1 and 51 are grouped together. I wish to amend the Long Title of the Bill. Following the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, we need to amend the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 in respect of the recognition of foreign vets and veterinary nurses for the purpose of transposing EU Directive 2013/55 on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. This directive had to be transposed by 19 January 2016, so it is pretty urgent that we enact it and use this Bill to do so. Essentially, what I am doing here is recognising the fact that if a veterinary nurse comes to Ireland, for example, he or she will have to have practised for at least one year and have basic English in order to be recognised under the appropriate regulations. Amendments Nos. 1 and 51 seek to provide for this and I ask colleagues for their co-operation and to facilitate us in using this legislation to get that work done. It is the only realistic way to do it in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">I wish to speak to amendment No. 31 as all of the others are linked to it. As I indicated on Committee Stage, I was not convinced that the wording of this provision reflected the new arrangements. The racing regulatory body in the form of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee will continue to provide the integrity services for point-to-point races and the hunt clubs will continue to organise and run meetings, while Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, will continue to support point-to-point racing financially. We had a long discussion on this and both Deputy Ferris and Deputy Penrose were very interested in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I wish to emphasise again on the floor of the House that we are not changing point-to-point racing in Ireland. The races are still being run by local hunt clubs. The role of local hunt clubs remains the same. The national steeplechase committee still provides the administration. The only thing that is changing is that we are following the advice we got from independent reports on streamlining services to provide better value for money. We are ensuring that when hunters are registered, the registration payment goes through a central office run by HRI and that money goes back into the Turf Club or steeplechase committee automatically. We have protections to make sure the money is paid without undue delay. Everything else in respect of point-to-point racing remains as it is today. It works very well. Point-to-point racing in Ireland is vibrant with many volunteers and we do not want to upset that or change the way it operates. We do want to respond to the recommendations on streamlining and are trying to ensure that we have one portal through which payments come in and go out. We can get efficiencies through that new process, which is one of the purposes of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> We had a long debate on this on Committee Stage and it was also discussed at a pre-legislative stage. I have also had discussions both on and off the record with a number of Deputies to try to reassure them on this. Following our conversation on Committee Stage, amendment No. 31 proposes to delete "to maintain the existing nature of point-to-point steeplechases" and to insert "to administer and control the integrity of point-to-point steeplechases". We are being more definitive in terms of the role of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee and the local turf clubs, for the avoidance of any concern or doubt.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">I fundamentally disagree with the Minister and believe he has reneged on a commitment he gave to me very clearly on Committee Stage. He said that the role of the local hunt club will remain the same and that the only change is to the office to which the cheques are sent, which will be a central administrative office. This is what he said on Committee Stage:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_902"> Rather than having two offices, one operated by the Turf Club and a second one operated by Horse Racing Ireland, which are located within a few hundred metres of each other, we are seeking to introduce one administrative function. That is the only change. Everything else remains the same ... We propose to change that to state: “to maintain the existing nature of point-to-point steeplechases including making and enforcing the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Regulations for point-to-point steeplechase as made by the Stewards of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.” We are trying to reinforce the point that this is the committee which sets the regulations and controls the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The amendments proposed by Deputy Ferris and I provide for administration and governance of point-to-point racing. However, point-to-point racing has never been included in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> I have a number of concerns about this Report Stage and I want to make it very clear early on that I am not going to be a Patsy. As far as I am concerned, the Minister gave a very strong commitment and it is not being honoured. Wherever this amendment came out of, it has jumped out of the ground and I am not accepting it. It is not consistent with what was said to me on Committee Stage. I accepted the Minister's bona fides then but the provision is now not there. This is where I caused a row on Second Stage. This is not unknown as anyone who has heard me will know my concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> This is an amateur sport. Similar to all other amateur sports across the country, it is run predominantly on a voluntary basis by local hunts. The hunts are supporting the role played by the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase, INHS, committees. I know this. I was even with them last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">The Minister is taking away from them. He is not changing anything. He is only taking away; that is all. The State has never had any involvement in point-to-point racing. It is not mentioned in any legislation. It was not included in Indecon's terms of reference or report. It made no recommendation on point-to-point racing. Let us be clear and not start fool-acting.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> The Minister said before that his rationale for including point-to-point racing in legislation was to get transparency in view of the fact that the sport is supported with a €1.5 million fund annually. Fair enough, we are fully with the Minister there. He is entitled to that. However, many other sports receive funding well in excess of €1.5 million - I can tell the Minister that - and there is no requirement for them to be included in legislation. They do not mandatorily have to register with a State body.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> On Committee Stage the Minister put forward an amendment to maintain the existing nature of point-to-point steeplechase and he explained that this was trying to reinforce the point that this is a committee which sets the regulations for the whole sector. That is a perfectly acceptable amendment. I was happy with that and indeed it was accepted by the INHS committee. Everybody was on board. However, the Bill before us today has further amended and delimited the INHS committee’s rights in this area, only allowing the committee to administer and control integrity. That is all they are getting.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> If I did not know the Minister I would say it was sleight of hand. In one fell swoop he is taking away the right that the INHS committees have had for well over 100 years to govern and administer the sport. There is a difference. I understand this.</p>

          <p eId="para_912">It is not. When one includes something specifically, that excludes everything else. That is the basic rule of legal interpretation. I understand that and I am well informed on this. This matter is going to end up in the courts. It is taking away rights and there is no need to take them away. If the Minister had stuck to what he said on Committee Stage, it would be game, set and match to him. He had taken the wind out of our sails and I am sure Deputy Ferris had to sit down and accept what he said. I accepted the bona fides here and was shocked when this amendment No. 31 was introduced. If we got this straightened out I think the rest of the evening could be easy, but this matter is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> I cannot understand where this is coming from. As far as I am concerned, the INHS has always done well and continues to do well for what is right in the sport. I do not believe this amendment serves the best interests of the sport and, constitutionally, what is being put forward in this section will be challenged if the wording remains unchanged. It is my job to scrutinise it here as best I can in the dying weeks of this Administration. No-one knows whether I will be back or not. So be it. If I am not back someone else will look at this and I may well be looking at it in another forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> If I was given a choice tomorrow on behalf of this group, I would strongly advise legal action. That is my strong legal opinion and it is shared by far more eminent people than I. Some of my colleagues know some of those who share this view. There is no need for this amendment. I urge the Minister to back down and to leave out the reference to integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Leave out the word "integrity" and we are in business. When the governance and administration is taken away, there is nothing. The clothes will be taken off the emperor; he will be naked.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I am deeply concerned about this and I ask the Minister to reflect carefully on how this will end up. Although I was ill for a few days and was not in the best of form, I believe the Minister has been fully put on notice about the importance of this section. Some of my colleagues may have more to say about it than me but I am certainly not happy about it. I urge the Minister to go back to the drawing board. He has a chance to sort this out in the Seanad, if all goes to all. I am not happy with it and want to reflect that very clearly and unambiguously.</p>

          <p eId="para_922">I understand the Deputies are attempting to deal with point-to-point racing and the role of the national steeplechase committee. This section is dealing with the functions of HRI, which is a State body. In my view, it is not appropriate to deal with the role of a private body within the functions of a State body, which is why we have dealt with the issue that is being raised here in the amendment I have proposed, which is amendment No. 31.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> Let us not forget there is nothing in the legislation at the moment in regard to point-to-point racing for the national steeplechase committee or the Turf Club. The Deputy himself said it is not in the legislation as it is an amateur sport. On the one hand, the Deputy said that by putting words in, we are excluding other roles. There are no exclusions here. All we are doing, for the purposes of being helpful, is clarifying that to administer and control the integrity of point-to-point steeplechases is the role of the regulatory body. It is self-evident that all of the other things that are currently there in terms of the management and running of those point-to-points remains as is. There is no hidden risk here, or anything like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The Deputy is making a big issue out of something. He asked that we hold on to the administration of the sport. That is exactly what we are doing - putting it in legislation that it would administer and control the integrity of point-to-point racing.</p>

Otherwise, we can put in what we regard as strengthening the position of the national steeplechase committee, following the conversation we had on Committee Stage, namely, “to administer and control the integrity of point-to-point steeplechases”.

          <p eId="para_943">There was no need. The option for us is simple, namely, to delete what the Minister had inserted and substitute “administration and governance (other than the administration and governance of point-to-point racing)". That is all we asked for. There is no big deal in that, from the Minister's perspective, but it is important for the point-to-points, the INHS and everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> There is an old dictum. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". There was never a problem with the point-to-points. Indecon did not even make one recommendation on point-to-points and, by God, it got plenty of money to make sure it looked at everything. As far as I am concerned, it is a big grab. Out of the 30-odd proposals from Indecon, one was that we have a value-for-money review of HRI but, three and a half years later, we have heard nothing about that. Maybe that is one of the recommendations the Minister should be looking at, rather than trying to pin point-to-points down to the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> I do not want to be argumentative but when I believe in something, I go the extra yard to see that right is right. I will give way to Deputy Ferris' amendment because I do not care whose name is on it if it is for the betterment of this. We should go back and look at this, even in the Seanad debate, to see whether we can rectify this. The Bill has to go to the Seanad and we would all be agreeable if we could sort it out there.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">We can go through the individual amendments. Let me be clear on this because I do not want a rewriting of the debate we have had. We had a pre-legislative stage where no big issue was raised in this regard and no recommendations to change this came from the committee, of which the Deputies are members. We had a very long discussion of this on Committee Stage. The Deputies know my position on it. We are not changing, interrupting or undermining point-to-point racing in Ireland and we are certainly not facilitating the kind of power grab Deputy Penrose seems to be advocating is happening. It is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> We are trying to do what is reasonable and accurate from a legal perspective. I am happy to go back to the wording we had on Committee Stage, which everybody felt was a reasonably balanced wording, from what I remember, if that is what Members prefer. However, we thought amendment No. 31 added to the clarity being provided for the national steeplechase committee in terms of its role in administration of point-to-points, along with local hunt clubs, and in terms of its responsibility for the integrity services. Now Deputy Penrose says he wants the word "governance" in there as well. I am sorry but this refers to administering in terms of running the point-to-points.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> How many belts and braces do we need to have? We have an accurate wording that is approved by the Parliamentary Counsel in terms of the legalities. That is consistent with the points I made on Committee Stage, which are consistent with the points Deputy Penrose made then. We could have left the existing wording, which everybody seemed to be reasonably happy with. However, I said I would see if we could strengthen it. We have come back with a proposal to strengthen it, in line with the views and concerns expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The Deputy is responding as if I am trying to change the goalposts, but I am not. There is no attempt being made to change the way in which point-to-point races are run in Ireland. This is consistent with the wording in the legislation, on which we asked the Parliamentary Counsel to provide clarity.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">If we are wrong, why are the people involved in the committees indicating this provision should be removed because it only allows the Minister to control the integrity of point-to-point race meetings? This is a serious issue for them. Why do they believe their right to govern and administer the sport which they have had for over 100 years is being affected? If we are wrong, why do they believe this is the case? There have been numerous communications between them and the Minister and, as far as they are concerned, the legislation delimits their rights in these areas and only allows the Minister to administer and control the integrity of point-to-point race meetings. It is for that reason our amendment seeks to delete the word "governance" and substitute "(other than the administration of point-to-point racing)". I know that the Minister is very quick, sharp and perceptive, but I cannot for the life of me understand why he is so doggedly opposed to accepting even one of our amendments. I would not care which one he accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_952">I have made a lot of compromises in response to concerns raised by various stakeholders in the horse racing industry, including the Turf Club. I will accept some of the amendments tabled, which I suspect will be strongly welcomed by that body. I am not going to be told how to write legislation by anybody. We have spent over one year in putting this legislation together and taken legal advice on the wording used and approach adopted. This section relates to the general functions of Horse Racing Ireland. It reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_953">(a) to provide for the overall administration, governance, development and promotion of the Irish horseracing industry, other than functions assigned to the Racing Regulatory Body under section 39(1), including promoting and increasing attendance at authorised racecourses.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">However, when it comes to point-to-point race meetings, the other functions assigned to the Racing Regulatory Body concern the administration and provision of integrity services. Therefore, it is clear we are not changing anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> I am happy to accept amendments and make changes when a valid case is made and we need to respond to it. However, we have already made changes in this area to reassure people, but I am not going to continue to make change after change when the advice is that the Bill reflects the position we want to reach in terms of legal accuracy. The legislation makes it clear that the position on point-to-point race meetings will not change. The only change is that when people register their hunters, they will send their cheque to a central administrative office run by HRI which will then channel the money to where it would have gone. That is all that is happening. I am not being defensive for the sake of it. We have changed the wording to try to add to what was already included. On Committee Stage it was felt it was not unreasonable to do this to try to strengthen the Bill further. I am happy to withdraw my amendment, amendment No. 31, if the Deputy would prefer to see what we brought forward on Committee Stage, but what we now propose will provide more certainty and protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_987">On amendment No. 21, the legislation ensures all interests of the horse racing industry will be represented on the board of HRI. As setting horse racing fixtures is one of the primary functions of HRI and final decisions in this regard need to be ratified by the board, I am seeking to ensure consensus. I cannot accept the amendment as it would undermine the inclusivity I seek to achieve for the sport of horse racing in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The structure proposes that there is a standard governance arrangement involving recommendations from a sub-board being made to the main board for final decision.

The sub-board is set up by the main board and this is a standard governance procedure. We had a good discussion on it and although the Deputy has tabled the amendment, my position is valid. We made that clear on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1004">This is simple enough. Subsection (2) proposes that "Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the media rights committee shall consist of not more than 5 members appointed by HRI and may include members who are not members of HRI.". Basically, Opposition Deputies are proposing that one of the people proposed shall be the HRI representative of the body known as the Irish Racehorse Owners Association. There seems to be some conflict about the official name as either Deputy Ferris or I have got it wrong. The idea is that as the owners are fundamental to the sport, they should be on the media rights committee. That is the basic proposal being made and it is valid. Whatever the proper name of the association, will the Minister accept the appropriate amendment so we can move on?</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">I support Deputy Ó Cuív's comments. The Minister is aware that the media rights money is paid to racecourses on the back of owners' data. That is the information relating to who owns the horse, the owner of the colours and the name of the horse. The owners' data are used to generate the media rights funding; it makes sense that without the owners' horse, name and colours, there would be no product to sell and yet there is no member from the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, which represents every member of the association, on the media rights committee established by the HRI. It is a missing piece in an otherwise clear jigsaw and it should be specifically inserted.</p>

I accept what people are saying and I have been around the horse racing industry long enough now to know the importance of owners, who pay for everything, basically. They train horses and make a major contribution to prize money; they have an extraordinary commitment to the sport. Racehorse owners are on the board and that board ratifies the deals and puts the media rights body together. In all likelihood, there will be an owner on the media rights negotiating committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1013">I am not in favour of giving any particular representative organisation rights where many other representative organisations claim an equal interest. There are already well-established arrangements that are working well. The current media rights negotiation process works reasonably well and most people are quite happy with it. We had a long debate on Committee Stage about trying to maintain the current arrangements in terms of getting the best deal possible for media rights. It is in the interests of racehorse owners and everybody else in racing that there is a team of people who know what they are doing, are experienced and understand the industry so that they can get the best deals possible around media rights. It is the broader board in HRI that ratifies the deal. It must consult with racecourses and finalise the deal. The main board makes the final decisions. The sub-board for media rights negotiates in order to get the best possible deal. The body that finalises the ratifying of media rights is HRI. There is a guaranteed place for horse owners on HRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> The Deputy makes valid points on the ratifying and finalising of deals in the best interests of the sport. Owners are fundamentally important in this. If we start prescribing the bodies that must contribute to a five person committee which brings back proposals to be ratified by HRI, we would limit the options in putting a balanced skill set in place. HRI must make decisions arising from that work. I understand the points being made and, more than most, I know the importance of owners. Without owners, there is nothing but owners would want to ensure that the media rights committee is made up of five of the most able people possible so as to get the best deals for media rights. That sub-board comes back to the HRI board for ratification and the owners are represented there. That structure makes sense and we are providing for it. It is the current structure and everybody seems to be reasonably happy with the current media rights deals.</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">The racehorse owners are absolutely integral to the industry. I hope the racehorse owner would never put somebody on the board of HRI who would be less than capable. If we made it a provision that racehorse owners would automatically have somebody on the media rights board, it would be guaranteed that an absolutely excellent person would be on the media rights committee. The Minister's argument falls in that respect. He stated that he must pick the best people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">Yes. I hope that racehorse owners, who have such an amount to lose by not putting absolutely excellent people on the HRI board, would never allow a situation where somebody who was on the board of HRI was not excellent in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Therefore, I do not see that one is imposing less than excellence by saying that there must a representative of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners on the media rights committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> The Minister probably knows by this stage because he is five years in the job that we are all going for a cold shower in the next few weeks. When I was a Minister, I often used to say that the executive officer who gets the file has a great deal of power because I often noticed that files that started at the bottom tend to get passed to the top. For that reason, to say that HRI can overturn the decisions of the media rights committee is technically true. To say that this would probably be the exception rather than the rule would also be technically true. About 90% of the time, most committees would find themselves nodded through at the more senior board unless something very bad was done. Therefore, the real powerhouse in the negotiations here is not HRI but the media rights committee. Anybody who was ever on committees with sub-committees would know this is the way the world really works on a day-to-day basis. As I have often said, the person who starts the file and proposal and agrees at the lowest level has a huge amount of power. Regardless of the shape they put it in, it has a big effect on what happens down the line. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister accepts the amendment. I do not think it is a lot to ask for. </p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> The Minister has been very good. I want to recognise that before I came in here, he came up with a similar amendment to the one I put down and I welcome that. I noticed that another one is coming up. I might have had arguments with him on many points but one thing I would say about him as a Minister is that he has been excellent in fully engaging in the legislative process with the Opposition. He has been more than willing to accept amendments and has gone through the process in a very iterative fashion. I will always grant that he makes the Oireachtas function properly from a legislative point of view. We have this week and next week left so perhaps he will accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1021">I wish to take up the baton Deputy Ó Cuív has extended to me and also compliment the Minister on the professionalism he has applied to the legislative process and to explaining and presenting his legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> The point that was made was that the media rights committee with its five members would be a lesser body without a member from the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners. As Deputy Ó Cuív noted, these people will ensure that they have the best listening ear, the best contacts and the best touch in respect of media rights and the interests of all. Even if the sub-committee was to be overseen or appraised by HRI, it is not the same thing. One needs close quarter to get the best. One will also see the operation of the other four members and whether they are up to scratch. There is a mutual auditing function in having a member of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners. We would fall short of the excellence that would be achieved if we did not include a member from the association. The Minister said he understood the reasons that were put forward. If he understands them, he should not hesitate to carry the baton and put it into the legislation. There is nothing to be afraid of.</p>

          <p eId="para_1026">The core of the question we must answer here is whether we or the board of HRI are better placed to determine who are the people on the five-person committee to negotiate media rights on behalf of HRI. We spent a long time looking and taking recommendations on this issue. The board of HRI is very balanced and all of the stakeholders in the racing industry, including racehorse owners, are effectively represented on it. As a result, there is a balanced representation of the industry and the State on HRI. It decides who are the best five people to negotiate media rights. They can be members of the board or not in terms of whoever it chooses as the best team. They then come back to report to HRI. Section 6(3)(b) states that "a contract or arrangement referred to in subsection (1) shall not be made by the media rights committee without the agreement of the board of HRI and representatives of executives of authorised racecourses." There is a process here that is working and with which people are reasonably happy. Racehorse owners are not asking me to make this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1028">I have not been asked by racehorse owners. There was no strong call in that regard. My only objective here, which we are following through, is to make sure that HRI, on behalf of the State because this is its legal function, actually puts together the best team possible to get the best financial return from the media rights deals that are available. It then has obligations in terms of how it spends that money. I want to trust the board, some members of which I or a future Minister will appoint, to use its judgment to put together a team of five people who can then bring contracts and proposals back for approval to the overall board, which will have racehorse owners represented on it. We will proceed on that basis. The current structure and system between the media rights group and the board of HRI is a reasonably good one and we are looking at continuing that and protecting it in legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">I will not cross swords with the Minister for the sake of it. As most people say, the Minister listens and gives us a fair hearing, whether we disagree or not. There will be reasonable requirements for the Racing Regulatory Body to effect various deductions and it is important that is not taken into account in allocating its budget. It could be denuded or weakened. The body has served us very well over many years. It is independent in its functions and infrastructure and jealously guards that independence. One can understand that. It works well with HRI. The Racing Regulatory Body is the Turf Club and has been independent of the horse racing industry for more than 200 years. HRI is the body charged with promotion of horse racing in Ireland. It is important that any reasonable deductions that are vouched and verified as requirements of the Racing Regulatory Body would be allowed for to ensure that it remains independent in its function and infrastructure. It is not going to break the bank but this is to ensure that it continues its role and gets the reasonable moneys required. It has never been extravagant in dispensing its functions. I would like the Minister to accept the amendment if at all possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">I had a conversation with the Racing Regulatory Body on this issue and I want to try to accommodate a subtle flexibility in the legislation. It is to enshrine and protect the role of the Racing Regulatory Body in providing integrity functions and racing but it does more than that. Anybody who understands the Turf Club knows that it does a lot more for racing. It holds receptions, it promotes, markets and enhances the reputation of racing and is extremely committed to that. Most of its members are volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> This section states that HRI shall account for and pay without undue delay or any set off a counter claim or deduction to the Racing Regulatory Body any funds received by it under section 39(1)(d) as a result of its registration. We are talking about what HRI takes account of when it is signing off on a budget for the Racing Regulatory Body in respect of providing integrity services. The wording is not unreasonable. It is not my wording. There are some risks because it has not been approved by Parliamentary Counsel. Some of my advisers are a little uncomfortable with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> From my perspective this adds to the fact that such amounts shall be taken into consideration when determining a budget for integrity services under subsection (1). We will add to that "after appropriate deductions for the reasonable requirements of the Racing Regulatory Body to ensure it maintains appropriate independent functions and infrastructure". In other words the cost of maintaining its independence and infrastructure for delivering the services that it has needs to be taken into account when those decisions are being made by HRI. That is not unreasonable so I will accept it.</p>

Otherwise, let us be honest, the HRI would have an excessive level of control over the independent regulator, which simply means that the racing regulatory body could no longer operate as an independent entity. This guarantees that it will be well set in stone. The amendment is important from that perspective.

I assume the Minister is still of that view and that he will not concede. I have therefore moved the amendment to see if he has changed his mind, although I do not anticipate that he has.

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1079">I move amendment No. 40:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1080">In page 17, to delete lines 37 to 42, to delete page 18, and in page 19, to delete lines 1 to 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">This amendment is about the sanctions and appeals concerning the rules of racing in section 13. I understand that the Minister has received much representation on this matter from the racing regulatory body which is very exercised over this and I understand HRI may also be exercised over it. I hope therefore that the Minister will look positively at this amendment. This is all about the rules of racing and the investigation process. The racing regulatory body is obliged to operate fair procedures and to adhere to natural justice both as a matter of public law, which as we know can be subject to judicial review, and private law. </p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> In the Supreme Court case that the racing regulatory body won last year, Mr. Justice O'Donnell concluded that the decision of the Turf Club, as the racing regulatory body after 1994, was amenable to judicial review. That decision may have little practical consequence for the Turf Club since it is already obliged to operate fair procedures - it does so as a matter of private law - and to give reasons for its decisions. No other sport, apart from greyhound racing, has its disciplinary process legislated for. However, as a matter of private law, each is required to have fair procedures and to comply with natural justice. </p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> The amendments to section 45 are, therefore, not necessary to ensure or increase fairness. The explanatory memorandum states that section 45 places a statutory obligation for transparency in regard to sanctions imposed by the racing regulatory body. However, the Minister must realise that under proposals in section 13, if the racing regulatory body needs to impose a mandatory fine of €100 on a participant in the sport, it will have to go through a number of steps, as well as having an investigation and an inquiry. It will then have to reach a view that the person has breached the rules of racing. That person will then have to be afforded an opportunity to make representation, and the person will then have to be informed of the procedures to be taken, although this may have happened earlier. They will also have to be informed of the place and time of any proposed hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> This means, if I might say so, that it is a lawyers' paradise. It is great news, but the only people who will have to pick up the tab at the end of the day are the taxpayers. I am being honest about that. This will be a huge procedure, given the way it is outlined here. I spoke to the racing regulatory body last week and it has legal advice which is probably far more eminent that I will ever be. It was of the view that under this section and given the way it is laid out, the racing regulatory body will be unable to suspend any horses. </p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> We should be careful in this regard. Could we imagine that the independent regulator for the multi-million horse racing industry was not able to ban a horse that had been administered an anabolic steroid, for example? That would surely make us a laughing stock and would not be good for us, if that were the position. Having looked though this section, I am concerned about it. The last thing the Minister wants is for the body to be unable to apply sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> There is no need for this section and it should be removed. It could damage us both at home and internationally. The Minister referred earlier to the heads of the Bill, under which affected persons were allowed to appeal to the District Court. We are now arriving at a stage where they could not sanction a horse. The last thing we want is to introduce legislation that leaves loopholes or deficits in procedure on impartiality and fairness. Poorly drafted legislation can leave lots of lacunae, so the Minister should take on board these clearly expressed and legitimate concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> People at the coalface daily are more <i>au fait </i>with the minutiae of this matter than we are. I would be surprised if HRI was not of the same view. The current system of sanctions works well because it is fair and impartial. The important thing is that less legal involvement is better, although that is perhaps a bit rich coming from me.</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">It is a bit rich. I had better declare that I am a barrister by profession. The racing regulatory body and others have been in contact with us about this. We have an opportunity to do the right thing, even at this stage. The Minister said it is easy to delete sections but difficult to introduce new ones. Some of the amendments propose doing that. Let us be practical, however, and do the right thing in this section. I would be surprised if the Minister's officials are not taking cognisance of some of the points that are being made in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">That was a long argument but this is a very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The arguments here are whether we should put the rules of horseracing in legislation or whether we leave them out and let the regulatory body apply the rules as it sees fit, applying natural justice and so on. There are real dangers with defining rules of racing in law because it then becomes an interpretation of the Bill as opposed to allowing a regulatory body to design and defend the rules of horseracing, as they are determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> Having listened to the arguments and having spoken to various people and got advice on it, my inclination is to accept amendment No. 40 to avoid the uncertainty and the potential difficulties that may arise by trying to define in full sanctions and appeals around the rules of horseracing in the legislation and simply to remove section 13 from the Bill. On balance, that is the reasonable and probably the safer thing to do at this stage. The people who have been making the arguments for that will welcome this. I propose to accept Deputy Penrose's amendment No. 40 and on that basis, I will not move my amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">As some said earlier on - I had my battle at the very beginning - the Minister is certainly somebody who is willing to listen. I accept that he too has explored it with other parties. This is a very important step by the Minister and he will not live to regret it. I hope the bodies involved will introduce the rules and act in accordance with them. They should keep everything out of court as much as possible. This is a way forward because it could have been a lawyer's paradise. If I lost my seat, I might have been able to look forward to a rich few days arguing many points had section 13 remained. The Minister might have removed a foot from under me in another form. I thank him for the constructive way he looked at this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1134">This is the very cronyism of which the Labour Party and the Minister opposite has accused others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> Hopefully, David Begg, a good man by all accounts, is not tainted by the hypocrisy of the party opposite. He may have the required experience for the job in question; I do not know him that well. If he had so much experience, why did the Tánaiste not encourage him to put his name forward, like the other mere mortals, into the hat of the State appointments procedure? Instead, a slíbhín method was used to appoint him, thus dragging him into the quagmire and controversy of the Tánaiste's making.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> That same mechanism was also used to bypass the system when appointing Ita Mangan last June to the Citizens Information Board, another well-respected and well-capable woman. I believe she will be a good woman in that position. The problem, however, is that once again a process set up and lauded by everyone as a major step forward was bypassed. Again, she would have more than likely come out on top if she had gone through the process but she was not encouraged or required to. This is not the first time the Tánaiste ignored her own promises. In her arrogance, she is willing to bend the rules when it suits her. One only has to look at the 25% hike above the salary cap set for special advisers to Ministers. The pay packet of her special adviser, Edward Brophy, was set at €120,000, 25% above the cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> Last night in her speech, the Tánaiste continued with the fairy tale to perpetuate the lie that she and this Government protected the core social welfare rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">The Minister and her party cut child benefit, jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, pensions, the household benefits package, maternity benefit and the respite care grant. Also, whatever lone parents had and whatever the Tánaiste had against them, she has stripped them bare. She cut the fuel allowance, the back to school allowance, the footwear grant and the bereavement grant. How can she stand over a statement that she protected core rates of pay? It is time for her to go and this is why I am supporting this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1139">Under the Tánaiste's watch, women, children, the poor, the vulnerable and low-paid workers have taken cut after cut and suffered blow after blow as she has implemented time after time, measure after measure, cuts that can only be considered as being anti-woman, anti-child and poverty creating. This Government in its time in office made eight separate cuts in payments to lone parent families. More than 10,000 of them had their weekly payments cut by as much as €87 per week. In addition, thousands of struggling parents saw their incomes fall as inadequate child care provision caused further hardship and additional expense. Add to that a homeless crisis and the emigration of our young and talented citizens, but the Tánaiste looked after those who really mattered to her, the elite, the high income earners, those who were well cushioned against her austerity policies - recovery, in other words, for those who least needed it. Now in the last dying days of this failed Government she engages in the same old tired parish pump style politics worthy of Tammany Hall, spreading the largesse among her pals, her last hurrah, looking after the Labour Party's own golden circle while looking over her shoulder at an election coming at her like an out of control steam train.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1141">Now like a deer caught in the headlights she attempts to pull out of the Labour Party hat political gimmicks and ludicrous and uncosted populist promises, as she tries so hard to curry favour in the hope that people will forget the injury she and her Government has caused them by an endless litany of austerity policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> It is insulting to suggest, as the Tánaiste claims, that she and she alone should be the arbiter of who is qualified or not for a public position. If David Begg is so eminently qualified, and I have no reason to believe otherwise, he is a very experienced man, why did he not go through the standard, transparent appointment process? Why did the Tánaiste feel in this case that it was necessary to circumvent it? The inference suggests that David Begg is not qualified for the position that he has been granted. The clear inference is also that this is merely a grubby display of cronyism, unworthy of any Tánaiste and unfair to David Begg. Of course, this is not a one off because the Labour Party has form in this regard. The Labour Party will clearly breach its own rules when it suits it. It really is a case of "do as I say, not as I do". The Labour Party, in particular, is clearly saying one thing and doing another. The Tánaiste pays her head of staff an annual salary of €144,424; that is almost €52,000 above the pay cap for special advisers. That is the pay cap set by the Tánaiste and the Government but it did not prevent her from breaching it because that is what she and the Labour Party do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> The Tánaiste's response to this latest outrageous display of abject cronyism is pretty much her usual response, one of breathtaking arrogance and dismissal of her critics in an almost dilettante fashion. Is the Tánaiste really so out of touch with reality that she thinks this latest episode was an acceptable way of doing business? Were there other candidates for this position with the Pensions Authority? What do they feel about it? Were they any less qualified? Perhaps they would have been more humble and less out of touch and would have considered €20,000 a sizable sum of money. It is not only about the income involved. Whatever is said does not mitigate against the simple fact that what the Tánaiste did was just plain wrong. It sends out every wrong signal about politicians and public life and it goes against every sentiment expressed today during the debate on the Public Sector Standards Bill, but what does the Tánaiste care so long as she cares for her circle and her cronies? There is an election coming up and she hopes against hope that the people will have short memories.</p>

          <p eId="para_1145">First, I would like to say I am glad about the appointment of David Begg to the position on the Pensions Authority for he is a man of great stature, he has done great service for the country, and he is a man to whom the Labour Party would adhere, as would any decent person who would seek to see trade unions represented and any person who would seek to see people's pensions protected. He has never done anything wrong by the State or by the people and he is a man around whom we would all put credit. Unlike some others who have destroyed pensions in this county, he is a man of integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> It would be incredible if we were to say that a member of the Independent Alliance had sought the nomination of one their cronies to a State board. It would be even more incredible should Deputy Ross have sought the promotion of one of his cronies to a State board, and it is truly remarkable that I can stand before the House tonight and say Deputy Ross sought the appointment of one of his cronies to a State board during his tenure in this House. I put it to the Deputy that he has to name that person to the House tonight and report it and if he does not, by tomorrow morning, I will put it on the record of the House. I put it to him, in his parlance, that he has just been hoisted by his own petard or, to put it in pain language, which is what we like to speak in Kerry, he has just seen his own bomb blow up in his own face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> Many things have been said about Members of this House and many good people have been appointed to positions who have done good things by this State. As parliamentarians, it is incumbent upon us to do the best thing by the people. A procedure has been put in place, which I welcome, and there is a clause in it which allows the appointment of David Begg, which I also welcome. One of the key points in that respect is the fact that women will be more represented on State boards than ever before. It is incredible that the two leading parliamentary Opposition parties, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, have only one female parliamentarian seeking re-election. We have always done the right thing by the female population, by 52% of the people of the country, and our leader will do something to make it equitable. In speaking about things being equitable and about equities, some people's character could be described as rakish in terms of what they have done in the past. They have marched people to the top of the hill and have asked people to pay into public meetings in order for them to talk about how great their objection is to the state the country. This is all factual information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> I put it to the House that in the event that the Independent Alliance did not know about this before tonight, an explanation should be given or they should seek to have a policy document, if they ever had one, around such matters as political reform. I find it comical at times when I hear stuntmen that one would find in Fossett's Circus taking about health and education, yet there is no document to back any of it up. We have done, and will continue to do, the right thing by the people. I do not believe any member of the public service would think there is something wrong with David Begg being appointed and nor would any member of the objective press media who give an equal amount of coverage to all Members of the House, and not to some Members who get an extraordinary amount of coverage in RTE and in the Sunday newspapers and do not pay for it; as a matter of fact, <i>au contraire</i>, they get paid for it. There is an awful lot wrong with tonight's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> We did some pre-legislative scrutiny in the past few months and there are measures I would like to see implemented in this House in the dying last days of this Government, which I would like to see re-elected. According to the polls, the people want to see this Government re-elected as well; they have not exactly gone in behind us just yet, but 30% of the population has yet to make up its mind. No damage will be done to the Labour Party tonight. I think the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and any member of the public service who is following these proceedings will say that the right man has been appointed for the job for the right reasons. It is not for price nor patronage that anybody has made this appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">I would like Deputy Ross to provide clarification on what I have told him before the end of the night. I have verifiable evidence on the matter. The Deputy must clear up the issue for the sake of his good name.</p>

          <p eId="para_1151">One of the things I am proudest of in this term of office is that we put in place an appointment system for State boards. Those reforms previously received very little media coverage despite the transformation of a system that has been the subject of political controversy since I first entered politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> There are now more than 4,600 people registered on a dedicated website, <i>stateboards.ie</i>, to receive notifications about vacancies on State boards. More than 300 appointments have been made using the process for the past 12 months. The system is administered by the Public Appointments Service, a body with an impeccable track record.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> I am particularly pleased about one achievement. As far back as 1993 the then Government set a gender target of 40% in regard to State board appointments but that target has never been met. Under the new process, approximately 45% of appointments are now women and it is only a matter of a short time before the 45% target is actually met.</p>

          <p eId="para_1166">When we designed this new system we knew that there would have to be exceptions. We set them out clearly for those who are worker directors and those in NewERA companies, among others. Following the publication of the guidelines not a single Member of this House, nor the commentariat, raised any concern about the clause.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167"> Mr. Begg's skill-set is well known. He is respected by all sides of this House. He has served Governments of all hues and he has served them well. He was leader of a movement that has served this country well, particularly in recent years. He has been dealing with pensions all his life, from the perspective of individual pension holders, not from the perspective of the industry. He is an experienced board member in both the private and public sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> That would appear to be the kind of skill-set and experience decried by Deputy Ross.

          <p eId="para_1171">It is a generous thing for IBEC to have done, as it too has been subject to abuse from the quarter responsible for this pantomime tonight, but I suspect those involved in IBEC know the importance of making progress on the crucial issue of pensions is more important than petty political point scoring. Yet that is precisely the calling card of the main mover of this motion tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> Deputy Ross is the archetypal hurler on the ditch. He is quintessentially a man of the system who pretends to rail against it. He is the original advocate of reckless capitalism. He is the bankers' friend who is now masquerading as the people's champion. He is a man whose membership of the media community is essential to his chameleon persona. That Deputy Ross has chosen to table this motion is not surprising. However, I confess I am a little surprised that he is joined by Deputies Halligan and Finian McGrath, whom I did not think shared Deputy Ross's hostility to organised labour. There are men who like to posture on the left but whose new political allies call them out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> There are many things that could be debated in this slot tonight - important issues - but this is not one of them. The Tánaiste is part of a Government that has put in place a transparent appointments system for this State that will last for generations. It was a brave and wise decision that will change that system for ever. The charge of cronyism would appear to hang on a phrase used by the Tánaiste that Mr. Begg assisted our party in the process of another breakthrough decision by this Government to legislate for collective bargaining rights. That is what trade unionists do. Or one could ask whether it is more basic that the appointment of a trade union figure is to be portrayed as a Labour appointment <i>per se</i> although Congress, the body of which Mr. Begg served as general secretary, is in no way affiliated to the Labour Party and contains both affiliated and unaffiliated unions. There are trade unionists who vote for all parties in this House and none. When others were appointed to positions in the past this charge was never made against them. Had any of my Fine Gael counterparts made this appointment, or a Minister of any other party, we would not be having this debate. That is the plain truth of the matter.</p>

He set out the situation lucidly and I do not propose to repeat those points.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175"> In his remarks to Deputy Ross, Deputy Spring reminded me of the great biblical exhortation to let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Those two speeches have fulfilled their purpose.

          <p eId="para_1180">Some points merit repetition. The core social welfare rates were maintained right through the recession. That is an achievement of the Tánaiste and the Government. Free travel was protected. The respite care grant has been fully restored to €1,700 and it was never less than approximately €1,400. Two weeks of paternity leave have been introduced. A modest but incremental increase has begun for the old age pension. Up to 75% of the Christmas bonus has been restored. Family income supplement has increased by €5 per week. The list goes on. The living alone allowance has been increased by €9 a week. School meals are of the utmost importance and an extra €3 million has been allocated for their provision. A second year of preschool care has been provided. One can see a complete package of welfare achievements by the Government in the midst of the deepest recession. That is the ultimate yardstick by which people with proper critical faculties will assess the performance of the Government and the role of the Tánaiste when they will look at the confidence motion tonight. There is no escaping those realities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181"> One of the great achievements of the Tánaiste in office and of the Government is that we have moved from a system whereby the traditional, paternalistic payment to jobseekers sentenced people to indefinite dependency to one where a support payment and a support system are provided through Intreo to support people to get from unemployment to work. Not only do we have the enormous record of creating in excess of 125,000 new jobs during our period in government and are currently creating approximately 1,000 a week, but we have the equally important achievement that those people who are now on jobseeker's benefit get a holistic approach and they are met by all the relevant agencies and given training, support and encouragement to get on programmes that lead to employment. All that is at a time when the minimum wage has been increased by the Government and the universal social charge has been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">There has been a set of strategies to fix the public finances and change the situation when we came into office where we were spending approximately €50 billion to €51 billion a year and only bringing in €31 billion a year in income. We transformed the situation radically, corrected the public finances and put people in good employment, while at the same time maintaining the core social welfare system, core payments and supports. </p>
          <p eId="para_1183"> There was nothing as radical, transformative or effective in bringing about social fairness and equality in our society as the introduction of the free second year of early childhood education. I live next door to a wonderful Montessori school and crèche and see cars pulling up and people walking in with their buggies in the morning. The parents who come and drop their young children are from all social classes, income groups and parts of the village. They come to that centre and drop off their children who attend free for a very important part of the day. The period under the scheme will be increased to two years. That is the record of the Tánaiste. That is what is relevant and what will be assessed by people outside the House rather than cynical posturing inside it.</p>

I was named yesterday by Deputy Finian McGrath as someone who had used a "get-out clause to make appointments". I want to make some points in reply to that charge. </p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> They do not have a party Whip in Deputy Finian McGrath's new group, but the Independent Alliance should make some effort to agree to have a line. I am generally loath to betray the confidence of a conversation with a fellow Member of the Oireachtas, but I will make an exception in this case. Yesterday, around the time Deputy Finian McGrath was sharpening his crayon to frame a limp attack on me and the Tánaiste, his colleague in the Seanad, Senator Feargal Quinn, who has the misfortune of being chairman of the Independent Alliance, personally congratulated me on choosing Dr. Nael Bunni as the first chairman of the construction contracts adjudication panel. As the author of the original Construction Contracts Bill, the Senator naturally had a very keen interest in seeing his measure passed and implemented. I recall that he told me that he knew Dr. Bunni and that I could not have made a better choice to serve as chairman. The Senator has an advantage over me because prior to appointing him, I did not know Dr. Bunni at all. I make no apology for not waiting for a possible application and instead proactively head-hunting and approaching the individual whose CV and track record made him best suited to chair this new body. I prefer the Senator's sound judgment on the merits of my appointment to Deputy Finian McGrath's ignorant and churlish comments. He and his colleagues in the so-called Independent Alliance - the party that is not a party - really are the rebels without a clue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> I am happy to confirm that I adopted exactly the same approach when it came to seeking another chairman for another new body I established - the Low Pay Commission. A politician or political commentator would have to be woefully or perhaps wilfully misinformed to think Dr. Donal de Buitléir, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, is a crony of mine or of my party. That is just mischievous nonsense aimed at the gullible and the uninformed. What is important to know about Dr. de Buitléir is that he is a former senior civil servant, a former president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, a former chairman of the Foundation for Fiscal Studies, the former secretary to the Commission on Taxation and that he has served with distinction as a member of a number of review groups for successive Governments in the areas of local government reform, the integration of the tax and welfare systems, business regulation, health funding and higher education. I can think of no individual better qualified to take on the task of serving as midwife to this new body which has performed its tasks extremely well. It is composed of representatives from both sides of industry and independent experts in labour market economics and statistical analysis. Furthermore, I can confirm that the members of these bodies all came through the Public Appointments Service process. I strongly believe I was both entitled and obliged, as Minister of State, to make sure the best candidate would be available to serve as chairman. I approached Dr. de Buitléir directly and asked him to serve. In the language of the guidelines governing this process which the Deputies opposite seem reluctant to use I "independently identified a person who is evidently and objectively highly-qualified and capable of effectively discharging the role of chair". </p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> The Independent Alliance's choice of subject matter for this Dáil debate does nothing more than highlight how little it has to state that is worth hearing. One can give Deputy Shane Ross great credit for a lot of things, but he has never let consistency stand in the way of his instinct for noisy populist guff. Consistency in his thinking is not an attribute we are entitled to expect from the man who constantly criticised the Bank of Ireland as a conservative establishment and asked why it could not be more like the get-up-and-go Irish Nationwide Building Society and the anti-establishment Anglo Irish Bank. He was the cheerleader for these banks and their chief executives, week after week in his Sunday column, as he breathlessly celebrated their enormous profits, at our expense as it turned out. This same man is also on record as calling Sean Quinn a genius, the champion of the customer, describing Quinn Direct as the most successful insurance business in Ireland and positively welcoming the massive Quinn share purchases in Anglo Irish Bank. The House does not need to be reminded that that particular farrago did not end well. It is just a pity that the national parliament has to devote time to dealing with such a false and trumped up charge from these publicity seeking, self-preening opinionisers whose only common platform is the need to have one.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">I have listened with interest to the debate and the characterisation of the appointment process of Mr. David Begg as a secret clause when it was anything but. It was highly publicised how a chairman could be appointed. One might not necessarily agree with it, but it was highly publicised. There was nothing secret or untoward about it. By and large, the way people are appointed to State boards has been reformed by the Government, although perhaps not as much as I would like. Like most of the reforms carried out by the Government, they may seem huge to people who have been in the system for ten, 15 or 20 years but to others newer to the system, they seem less revolutionary, to put it mildly. It is interesting that nobody on any side of the House has suggested Mr. Begg is not qualified.</p>

          <p eId="para_1190">The Deputy will be saying he is not qualified; I look forward to hearing it. Whether one agrees with the trade union movement, most people acknowledge that Mr. Begg has played a very substantial role in it. I think some of the Deputy's colleagues in the Technical Group would acknowledge that the trade union movement has been hugely beneficial to workers and the protection of their interests, including their pensions. With others, the Deputy has rightly criticised what happened to the Aer Lingus workers. That came about as a result of the actions of their own trustees and, I argue, inadequate oversight by the Pensions Authority. The approach was one of self-regulation, in other words, asking pension funds if they had enough. Everyone thinks that is fine. Have we not learned any lesson? The pension sector is in radical need of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191"> Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh suggested that if Mr. Begg was so qualified, it would have been better to ring him to ask him to apply. That sounds good and I initially thought it was not a bad idea. Is it sufficient to have the charade of reform without actually changing how the system works? Often in this country it is decided in advance who will get a position, yet it is advertised and people apply for it. Those advertising the position know who they want and why they want him or her. This is called head-hunting and it is done in the private sector. We think the processes in the public sector should mirror more closely the appointment processes in the private sector, yet when it happens, we take huge issue with it. If one is to head-hunt a person, one should telephone him or her to ask him or her to apply. If one does not want to go through the Public Appointments Service process and let it decide, one should at least be open and honest about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1193">That is what happened in this instance. We talk a lot about political gimmicks, but the political gimmick is this motion of no confidence. Perhaps the Tánaiste might have done it another way, but that is not what we are debating. We are debating a motion of no confidence in her because of how she has run her Department. I will be quite happy to go through the voting lobbies and I am sure a walk-through vote will be called.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">If Members are going to have the theatre of politics, then let them have it. There will be a walk-through vote. I am happy to walk through the lobbies on the Tánaiste's record of reform. If one goes back to the Beveridge report that came out immediately after the Second World War, its objective was to do away with the five great evils, namely, squalor, ignorance, want, disease and idleness. For a long time, the social welfare system in this country - the Twenty-six Counties, as Sinn Féin would refer to it - has been about buying off a group of people. It has not been about vindicating the right to work or about getting such people back to work, making them functioning members of society and protecting them when they do not have a job. It has been about buying them off and if Sinn Féin has learned one lesson from its so-called republican brothers who have governed in the South-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">I will conclude. The Tánaiste has introduced a number of schemes that are about getting people back to work, including the Pathways to Work scheme and the back to work family dividend, to ensure there are no longer poverty traps that keep people dependent on social protection. In addition, she has introduced a JobsPlus employer initiative and a start-your-own-business scheme, both of which specifically target the long-term unemployed, a first steps programme, the new Gateway county and city council work placement scheme, as well as changes to the community employment scheme. It might be astounding to Sinn Féin but many people from my constituency have approached me to say although they are 62, they do not wish to fall into a welfare trap but rather they would like to continue to work and contribute.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, has been the Minister for Social Protection for the past five years. In the early days of the Government, hers was an almost impossible task because the country was broke and unemployment was out of control. As a nation, we were unable to borrow the money necessary to safeguard the most vulnerable. Nevertheless, despite all these difficulties, the Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, managed to protect the basic social welfare payments and has now begun to improve them. There have been increases in the old age pension and child benefit, as well as the return of the Christmas bonus. One of the first things done was to increase the minimum wage. The Tánaiste has always stated that Labour is a party for the working class. Creating jobs and protecting rights in employment are priorities. The priority of creating jobs fits well with Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The best way out of poverty is to create a job for the person affected and his or her family. As Members have seen, this policy has been extremely successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> Those in the media have become obsessed with board appointments. Such appointments are important and should go to those who are qualified to do the job in question. However, they also should go to those who are committed to the Government policy of the day. Appointing people to various positions to help promote the policy of the Minister of the day is essential and necessary if there is to be real reform. It could be argued in the past that even when in opposition, Fianna Fáil was never out of power as its influence, through its appointees, continued even when it was out of office. It is argued in some democracies that for a change in government to be effective, many senior officials and boards also should resign. Instead of being criticised, the Tánaiste should be commended on appointing a person of the calibre and experience of David Begg to the Pensions Authority. All Members are aware that the country faces a pensions crisis and it is completely appropriate to appoint somebody with Mr. Begg's track record and experience in the trade union movement. As workers and their rights will be affected by the decisions made by that authority, it is entirely appropriate from a democratic point of view that the Tánaiste would appoint a suitable candidate who shares the same values and policies on which her party was elected. I commend my fellow woman on a job well done for the past five years and I totally reject this motion.</p>

I find the amendment tabled by the Government somewhat odd. All Members are aware that this debate is about the appointment of David Begg, former general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of the Communications Workers Union, CWU, to the position of chair of the Pensions Authority. This appointment was made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Burton, who used a loophole that was deliberately included in legislation to supposedly stop political appointments and cronyism. What I find odd is there is no mention in the Government motion of the appointment or any attempt to justify or defend it. Is this because it simply is an indefensible piece of stroke politics?</p>

          <p eId="para_1213">No. The Government often defends the indefensible but perhaps this time, even for those who are not easily embarrassed, it may be a step too far. Surely, this was an opportunity to defend the Government's record on political reform in general. Was this not an opportunity for the Government to show how it has progressed the democratic revolution proclaimed by the new Taoiseach in 2011, together with a commitment to radically overhaul the way in which Irish politics and Government works, by which I mean everyone can do with a good laugh now and then? Every single so-called reform introduced by the Government has been exposed as nothing more than spin. In reality, absolutely nothing has changed. I have no doubt but that it will be business as usual in the next few weeks, with a raft of political appointments to State boards, quangos and whatever else by a Government on the verge of leaving office. There is nothing new here, certainly not for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or the now misnamed Labour Party. Together with such cronyism, auction politics is now in full swing in the run-up to the general election, which the people were promised would never happen again after the 2008 crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214"> I will conclude by making a number of points. First, I wish to appeal to people in general not to allow their vote to be bought by those chancers on the other side of this Dáil Chamber. They should not allow themselves to be bribed with their own money because that is what is happening here. People should make no mistake about it: we live in a capitalist society, there will be more crashes and the Government certainly will not be capable of defending people who will be made to pay the price again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215"> I wish to make a point about the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, of which David Begg has been a director. I am sure Proinsias De Rossa, who is the chair of TASC, endorsed the press statement that was issued on 6 February 2015 stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1216">As part of its work on democratic accountability, TASC has long advocated for a more independent process to replace the ad hoc and politicised appointment of people to serve on the boards of public bodies or state initiatives. TASC has published a number of reports highlighting best practice in corporate governance.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1217">Reacting to the announcement of the reforms formally launched yesterday by Minister Howlin, TASC Director Paula Clancy said “The Government’s reforms are a long awaited and welcome move to a system of public appointments based on merit, diversity and transparency.”</p>

          <p eId="para_1229">I will make two appeals, one of which is to David Begg. There has been much discussion and praise of David Begg's integrity and of how good a man he has been over the past number of years. I was a young trade union activist in the CWU in the 1980s when David Begg became general secretary of that union. I remember being at the conference at which his taking of the job or otherwise was being debated. David Begg made two very good points. He said that if one pays peanuts, one gets monkeys and, as a result, he sought a good wage, which was fair enough. He also stated he would not accept a job in which he did not have a lifelong expectancy to have that job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">The rules were, therefore, changed at our conference to allow that to happen. I did not agree with it at the time. People should have to put themselves forward before the membership or before the people, as we do, to get re-elected. David Begg secured that change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> We were in a job where every job was secure and every job was pensionable. Within approximately six years of David Begg's appointment, we have come to a point where men and women are waiting on a telephone call at 6 a.m. to find out if they will be called into work that day. This was started by the general secretary of the Communications Workers' Union at the time. We had a situation where there was equal pay for work of equal value. We now have a situation where people in my grade - the post office clerk's grade - have two different wages. There is one wage for younger people who came into the job in the past ten years and there is a different wage, that is, the one I was on as a public sector worker, for others. This cuts across the whole idea of equal pay for work of equal value. We were brought into social partnership but social partnership has brought us to where we are today. I appeal to David Begg to stand down and to do what people expect of him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232"> David Begg said he was not in it for the money and that it was only a paltry €20,000. A living wage of €11.50 per hour would bring in €24,000 a year. David Begg calls the money people must live on paltry. It is pocket money for him. He should step down. He should say he will not accept this job. Any Member in this House on the Government's side that votes as having confidence in the Tánaiste is buying into the maintenance and continuance of cronyism in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1241">In that sense, I would not normally have contributed to this debate but I felt I had no choice but to do so on behalf of the 15,000 members of the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme, IASS. Half of them probably do not know that the Tánaiste was involved in the appointment of David Begg or that there was any question mark over the process. However, prior to that getting into the media, people, when they heard that David Begg had got this position, were gobsmacked given the role he has played in terms of pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> Yesterday morning in my car coming in to work, I could not believe it when I heard the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, on "Morning Ireland". He tried repeatedly to tell the nation that the appointment was by the book. We all know it was not really by the book. In fact, it was against the whole spirit of the book but relied on one line buried in the middle of it. The Minister then went on to tell us repeatedly that no one had a problem with David Begg and that he was the best thing since sliced bread as far as pensions were concerned. That is not true; it is manifestly false. The Minister continued to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> that he was manifestly and exceptionally qualified. That is not true and I will make some points in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_1243"> David Begg was on the board of Aer Lingus and head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. He played a role in the IASS which saw the living standards of deferred pensioners and existing retired members of the scheme decimated. People will be appalled listening to what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, said. They will be struck dumb at the description of David Begg as fighting for ordinary pension members, because it is not true. The Labour Relations Commission pleaded with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority to assist and to step up to their responsibilities in respect of the IASS. I have a copy of a letter from the Labour Relations Commission to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It dates from 2011, when David Begg was at the helm, and asks the organisation to deal with the future pension scheme and for its view on how the process should be resolved. What was the answer? Absolutely nothing. I have a letter from 2012 to the same Irish Congress of Trade Unions, headed by David Begg, from the Retired Aviation Staff Association. Against the backdrop of Aer Lingus going into the commercial courts to try to reduce its capital, thereby jeopardising the accrued benefits of Aer Lingus pensioners who had paid for a reasonable expectation in their retirement, the association appealed to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to stand with it. What did the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and David Begg do? Absolutely nothing. That is David Begg's record in terms of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244"> What happened to those people? What process did David Begg stand over for those pensioners? They were excluded from any negotiations about their livelihoods. Some €6.5 million has been taken out of their pockets since last year. Coincidentally, in the same period, the Aer Lingus company, which is one of the companies involved, allowed one person, namely, the last chief executive, walk away with €6 million. That is the equivalent of what was robbed in one year from existing pensioners, and David Begg was a board member and party to that injustice. It was ensured that no mitigation moneys were put in to defray the cuts to existing pensioners. Pensioners were not allowed sit at the table and be involved in the negotiations. The Retired Aviation Staff Association wrote on numerous occasions to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions begging for its assistance but the door was kept firmly shut. Those are the people who built the companies, having worked there all their lives, and all of them were trade union members who had paid their subscriptions throughout their entire time there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245"> When the Workplace Relations Bill was introduced, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions did nothing to advance the position of pensioners or give them a voice in the talks. In fact, the congress argued against it. If this is the expertise on which we are relying, people should be very afraid. Not only did David Begg do absolutely nothing for those pensioners who now have had their livelihoods diminished but these people have had millions of euro taken from their pockets. A unilaterally imposed section 50 debt repayment has been put on their monthly income. One of them made the point to me today that, in 2008, VHI contributions were 11% of State pensions but now they are 28%. They have had cuts to their private scheme on top of the 2.5% pension levy, yet they did not even get a voice in the process. </p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> Do the Ministers know, when David Begg was head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, how many pension initiatives were put forward by the congress under his watch? None. Not only that, he was the head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when its own pension fund floundered. It was underfunded, benefits were cut and entry was closed to new members. One of the trustees of that scheme was Brian Duncan. He was also involved in the troubled pension scheme in SIPTU and was the chair of the trustees of the IASS when David Begg was on the board of that company. Pensioners were robbed of a legitimate expectation to a decent income on their retirement, which they had paid for. This was stood over by this man, as a member of the board of Aer Lingus and as the head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. With expertise like that, we are very much in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> The one thing on which I agree with Deputy Spring is that the pensions industry needs to be challenged. There is no question about that. The Pensions Authority also needs to be challenged. I have no hesitation in saying it is rotten to the core. Adding David Begg into the mix is not going to help. I would nearly say it would increase the rottenness. This organisation needs to be taken on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248"> The appointment of David Begg is severely disappointing and is indefensible. The Government can dress it up all it likes but there are people tonight who are poorer in their retirement because of David Begg and they are not one bit happy with the Government.</p>

        <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_666">
          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2016-01-20T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1249">As my colleague Deputy Paul Murphy said last night, the Labour Party manifesto, on reforming politics, referred to it being a time for change. The manifesto made it clear that Ireland would never again suffer from abuses such as those seen in the past and that all positions were to be opened up to qualified candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> After the McNulty candidacy, the Tánaiste spoke about new procedures which would be much clearer. Now, this week, those have been bypassed. The Tánaiste is condemned by her own words.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251"> The Labour Party leadership came in tonight in the form of Deputy Brendan Howlin and tried to throw smoke and mirrors around the whole issue. It was laughable hearing Deputies opposite talking about gender quotas to try to distract us in some way. Then they came along with the charge that anybody supporting this motion is attacking the labour movement because Mr. Begg comes from that movement. What part of the labour movement does Mr. Begg come from? He comes from the part of that movement that earns €137,400 a year - his salary as the general secretary of ICTU - and has a company car. I assume the Tánaiste agrees with that. In other words, he does not represent the many people in the labour movement who do not earn €137,400. He represents the side of the labour movement that consciously worked to ensure no protests took place when the working class people of this country were sacrificed to pay the gambling debts of developers, bondholders and the wealthy elite.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252"> Since the Labour Party has come in tonight trying to defend the appointment of Mr. Begg, it has put his position up for debate. In 2010, he was the head of the trade union movement in Ireland, when the beginnings of €16,000 was taken out of the pockets of every man, woman and child to pay the debts of the bondholders. Mr. Begg retired in March and who gave the eulogy at his retirement do only the Tánaiste. She thanked him for his role in supporting the work of the Labour Party. What part of cronyism is that? The Tánaiste appoints one of her own, who supported her in her work. I know the position only pays €20,000, which is chicken feed in the pockets of David Begg but to other people, it is a serious amount of money. Mr. Begg was involved in Eircom and Aer Lingus when both companies were privatised, about which he did nothing. Recently, he testified to the banking inquiry as to why he did nothing as a non-executive director of the Central Bank. He admitted that supervision was neither effective nor appropriate in that context. This is the David Begg for whom the Tánaiste has rushed to bypass the selection procedure. </p>
          <p eId="para_1253"> Tonight we are debating a motion of no confidence. The Government has put up many reasons that we should have confidence in the Tánaiste. As Shakespeare said, "let me count the ways" that I do not have confidence in her. Since coming to high office, the Tánaiste has rendered useless through over-use so many adjectives used in the past, such as treacherous, disgraceful and incredible. Even by the standards of right wing Labour, which has gone into coalitions for the past generation, in her role as Minister for Social Protection, a portfolio so integral to so many vulnerable, working and unemployed people, women and children, she has shown no mercy when asked to swing her axe by Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254"> She began with a propaganda campaign about welfare abuse when she took office in that Department, paving the way for an attack on all of the safety nets that people need in society. Most startling is her attack on women, mainly working class women. Funnily, she got elected on the back of Mary Robinson's election in the Mulhuddart ward. Since coming into this office, she has proceeded to cut child benefit, which attacks every woman in this country - a broken promise by the Labour Party-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1256">-----and eight separate cuts to lone parents, 90% of whom are women and who constitute the biggest group in poverty in society already. Along the way, the Tánaiste has used the most Tory style language of welfare dependency, which was absolutely despicable and callous beyond belief. Despite letters and protestations from many women, she had no compassion. She cut the back to school allowance, clothing and footwear allowance, fuel allowance, maternity pay and, of course, rent allowance - a key facet of the Tánaiste's Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257"> The manner in which she has presided over a housing and rents emergency really puts her position up for a vote of no confidence. Cutting rent supplement was bad enough as it meant she was putting the most vulnerable in the position of becoming homeless. More than that, how does a Labour Party leader stand over 28 council houses getting built in the first three quarters of 2015? How does the Tánaiste justify that? Surely the Labour Party is at least meant to stand for something like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> One of the Tánaiste's most despicable acts in her role as leader of the Labour Party and Tánaiste was the event in Jobstown, where she has criminalised a whole working class community. This Friday, men and women will go to court because of the Tánaiste bringing into play gardaí, who have had nothing else to do for the past year. Those men and women will face the court for daring to protest against her austerity measures. I have often heard the Tánaiste say she has no role in the police prosecuting this. I have never once heard her ask for the charges to be called off. She has that chance tonight as she has had for the past year or so.</p>

          <p eId="para_1324">Two appointments have been made outside the public service appointments process by the Labour leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection. It reminds us of the position not long ago when the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, appointed the chairman of the Workplace Relations Commission outside of the normally recommended procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> It is a timely revelation because, this week, the long-awaited Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 is going through Second Stage in the Dáil. We will be hearing Ministers on the Government benches touting more false declarations of just how much they pushed for political reform. It is no wonder David Begg was appointed earlier this week and not after the Bill was passed by the Dáil. Why not wait until the Bill was passed and use the outside appointments board that would have been established by it? Why was the Tánaiste so quick to appoint the ex-ICTU chief David Begg as chairman of the Pensions Authority? What expertise does he have on the issue of pensions anyway? Indeed, I heard him interviewed on radio when he said he did not even know this job was available and that it is not a job he would have chosen, so where is his expertise and his qualification for the job? How are our citizens and members of the public, whose money is paying for his €20,000 annual fee, supposed to know about his qualifications-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">The debate is about the use of the public appointments process. I would like to also remind the Labour Party that, on page 42 of its 2011 manifesto, it stated its first step would be to: "End political cronyism by opening up positions on state boards to all qualified candidates, and require appointments to be scrutinised by the Dáil." Under the manifesto heading, "Ending Political Cronyism", it stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1328">Labour will end the system whereby appointments to state boards are used as a form of political patronage and for rewarding insiders. In future, appointment to boards must be based on a demonstrable capacity to do the job. Labour intends to start this process immediately... Labour will publicly advertise all vacancies, and invite applications from the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Here we are, five years down the road, and it is only now bringing in legislation to establish the outside appointments commission, and it actually makes appointments before that legislation comes through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> In paragraph 9.1.4 of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's published guidelines on appointing people to State boards, there is a sneaky clause hidden in the middle of the nine-page document allowing exemptions to any of these rules if the Minister can identify a person who was evidently and objectively highly qualified and capable of effectively discharging the role of chair of the State board, and who has not otherwise applied through the <i>www.stateboards.ie </i>process. I and the public would like to know how a Minister, the Tánaiste in this case, or even a party leader, identifies or demonstrates that an individual is evidently and objectively highly qualified. I do not remember the Tánaiste handing out CVs to people, asking them whether they can verify the qualifications for the job, so how has it been identified that David Begg, or indeed Ita Mangan, who was also appointed by the Tánaiste to the Citizens Information Board outside normal procedures-----</p>

These people's highly public profiles do not exactly identify or demonstrate their high skills. It is sickening to think that certain cherry-picked individuals are awarded privileged positions in society and, in this instance, allowed to bypass the interview process which ordinary applicants have to overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333"> I remind the Government we have a jobs crisis in this country, whatever about the figures or repetitive talk of an economic upturn. In my county of Donegal, jobseekers looking for work in the local economy have seen little job creation overall since the crash and a lack of rural broadband or infrastructure upgrades to the road and transport network, while other anti-rural policies pushed by the Government have stifled job creation. The quality of the majority of these new jobs is questionable and many people, including seasonal workers, find themselves in "if and when" and zero-hour contract jobs. As a result, they are relying on the social welfare income supports which the Tánaiste has persistently cut since coming into government. Furthermore, she has ruled out any commitment to restore jobseeker payments for those aged under 26 and has failed on the promise of a youth guarantee, leaving over 2,000 young people still unemployed in County Donegal, an unacceptably high number after five years in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334"> I recently received parliamentary question replies in regard to JobPath, a programme which is furthering the privatisation of social protection and off-loading the long-term unemployed to private sector companies. Some 3,000 people are currently under their watch and very little is known as to the mechanics of this outsourcing. The "pay by results" contracts at the centre of the private companies' pact with the Department of Social Protection is a model known to push claimants into low pay, low quality and temporary employment. This cycle is already happening to people on part-time, low hours or seasonal work, but many more people who are long-term unemployed could end up moving between poor quality employment and social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> The inclusion of private sector companies to carry out State services is a reflection of the incompetence of the Department and its Minister in dealing with the long-term unemployed. There are not even sufficient monitoring regimes in place, which I know because the Tánaiste could not even answer a question as to the costs awarded to private companies which are coming from the State's pockets because she deemed them commercially sensitive - "commercially sensitive" appears to mean the use of public money. This new strand of privatisation of public services scarily reflects what has been happening in the UK with the Conservative government. I fear that the most vulnerable once again will be pushed aside and that the issue of access to child care has been disregarded, affecting many lone parents already hit hard by the Tánaiste's cruel cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> How many others of those who have been or are currently on State boards are to blame for much of the incompetence that has played out in the provision of Government services and the management of our economy? We will never know because we cannot hold these people to account as we never knew if they were objectively or evidently highly qualified.</p>

          <p eId="para_1338"> There is nothing particularly wrong about that, and it is hardly the first time it has happened.

Let us cut to the bottom line. The chair of the Pensions Authority is an important job. David Begg is the best man for the job and the Tánaiste was well within her rights to exercise her initiative and ask him to do that job.

          <p eId="para_1341"> As the House knows well, the Government has established new rules for appointments to State boards. We changed the rules to make the system more open and to broaden the range of people on State boards. A report produced by the Institute of Directors before Christmas makes it clear the new regulations are working. We have a wider range of people, better qualified people and a system people really trust. The new system is the most radical reform of our system of governance in the State sector and it will serve us well into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> When we changed the system, we deliberately ensured that Ministers would be able to use their initiative to appoint people of high quality who are well qualified for the job. That is precisely what the Tánaiste did in this case. She appointed a man whose qualifications for the job are impeccable and who also has the know-how to drive the implementation of policy for the next few years. He is well qualified on that. David Begg has the experience, the expert knowledge and the personal qualities needed to do the job, and I know he will do it well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> Much of this debate has been dominated by talk about the past, which is fair enough. As we come to the end of this Dáil, it is only right we should reflect on the record of this Government. It is only right we should talk about how we came back from bankruptcy to be the fastest-growing economy in Europe. It is only right we should talk about how we are putting the country back to work, with nearly 1,000 new jobs announced just today. It is only right we should talk about the progress we have made in public services, despite the fact Fianna Fáil left us without a red cent to spend in the first three years of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> In my own area, I am particularly proud of the progress we have made in modernising our mental health services. I am proud of the fact parents no longer have to worry about the cost of bringing their children to see a doctor. I am proud we are able to put money into the fair deal scheme and make sure it is on a sound footing for the future. I am proud of what we have achieved. However, I am also frustrated that the Government has had to spend much of the last five years cleaning up the mess left by Fianna Fáil and the Greens. Thankfully, that part of the job is nearly done. The recovery is not yet a done deal but we are well on the way. Just as the Opposition will complain and protest about the past, it is our job on this side of the House to talk about the future, to talk about what we have to do with public services, to talk about what we will secure and how we will ensure the recovery remains solid and on a firm footing, and to use the fruits of that recovery to improve the lot of all our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">We have done the job the Irish people asked us to do five years ago. Our job now is to paint a picture of a better, fairer future and to persuade the people to give us the chance to make it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> I find the fact that someone who has spent life inside and outside of this House talking about how bad it is that people should have pensions at all and the scathing attacks made by Deputy Ross on Aer Lingus pensioners looking for their rights to be reinstated particularly annoying. It is sad that we now see others on the other side of the House taking the same position. It is ridiculous. This motion should never have come before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1348">Yesterday evening I came in to listen to the debate, but all I heard from the across the floor was what Fianna Fáil did in its last five years. The following contributor then spoke about people who had connections with bankers and what they did and said during those years. I am not long here, but I have seen all of that on television and it is all history now. A government is like a football team. It should take up the mantle and go forward and should not keep blaming the Opposition for losing the match.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> The reason this motion has been put forward is simple. It is because of cronyism. It is not because of what Fianna Fáil did in its last five years in government. It is not because of what Deputy Shane Ross did or did not say in those years. It is not a blame game, but simply because of cronyism, an issue we heard about on radio in 2011. We were told then there would be no more cronyism, no more nods and winks, and that politics would be done in a new way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350"> Anybody in business who wants to take on a new employee goes through a system. They advertise the position, people apply for it and submit CVs. The employer examines the CVs and whittles the numbers down to the eight or ten most suitable people for the job and interviews them. Employers do not just take people in on a nod and a wink. Nobody suggests that the person in question in this case is not suitable. What they are saying is that due process should take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1354"> Let us not hide behind a line in legislation. We can have all the legislation in the world, all the dos and don'ts and can hide behind the provisions, but we must still be able to look ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves whether we did it right, whether it was fair, whether we did it for the people of Ireland, whether we did it for the future of pensions and whether we did it for our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1383">Before I forget, I would like to deal with the statement made by the Minister of State. I do not know what she is referring to in regard to pensioners. I was one of the people in this House who represented the deferred pensioners of Aer Lingus and the DAA in this House in regard to the conditions the Minister and the Government so ruthlessly imposed on them. I do not know what she was referring to, but I think she got it wrong. That is all right. I am used to her getting it wrong. I do not ask her to apologise, but would like the record to be corrected. She is wrong. I never did what she said. I represented the people to whom she referred - quite the opposite of what she said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384"> Deputy Spring made a statement suggesting I made representations for people to be put on a semi-State body. Since I have been a Member of the Dáil or the Seanad, I have frequently made suggestions about who should or should not be on semi-State bodies. Since I have been such a critic of the cronyism that has gone on, I have been asked frequently for new names and new suggestions for members and I have done that and am not ashamed of doing so. However, I am not going to name all of them tonight at the whim of Deputy Spring. Their names are on the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_1387">The reason I have done that is because of the cronyism of the Government and the criticism of other governments. I have done so because I do not believe the way these jobs are being filled currently is right. I do not ever wish the appointments boards to bypass proper process. What I have done is suggest names as alternatives to the cronyism and I will continue to do that, because that is my job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388"> Let me get back now to this important motion. David Begg is not the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">The Government, today and yesterday, has tried to make the virtues, talents and merits of Mr. David Begg the issue. That is not the issue. The issue is that a process was constructed simply to give the impression that there were some new guidelines for the appointments to semi-State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390"> The Tánaiste is aware of the nine-page document introduced after much palaver as some sort of fresh approach to the cronyism that existed under this and previous Governments. The process was first introduced in what was called a model by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in September last year when he stated, although not in this House, that "today's decision complements the current system with a more structured approach requiring that all appointments to vacancies on State boards must: be advertised openly on the State boards portal, <i>www.stateboards.ie</i>, operated by the Public Appointments Service." That did not happen in this case but the Minister announced that it would be happening now. Why did it not happen in this case?</p>

All we are asking on this side of the House is that Mr. Begg, for all his talents - and he has them - should simply be treated like a normal mortal.

          <p eId="para_1415">She cannot get away with that. It is important as this particular model, which camouflaged everything so well, was constructed deliberately with a great gaping hole in the middle. It negates all the other clauses that were put into the document, as a Minister, despite all the jargon, can still pick and choose whomever he or she wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416"> These guidelines have become a vehicle for cronyism. Unfortunately, there have been six examples outlined in the <i>The Irish Daily Mail</i> and other examples appeared today. They are the preface to what Deputy Daly referred to as a further example of the cronyism that we will continue to see in the farewell honours bestowed by the Government. This is only the beginning of a tradition honoured by all Governments since the foundation of the State. Only two weeks ago, we saw the process relating to the police authority, with an in-built bypass meaning the Minister can make direct appointments instead of the Public Appointments Service. She also has the same right to renew appointments. A week ago we saw an advertisement for judges placed in newspapers and they will, I presume, be appointed before the Government leaves office. The problem is this practice has not been tackled either. Why has the Government not decided that the way it appoints the Judiciary should change in the way it aspired to? Instead, we have seen a running mate of the Taoiseach appointed to the Judiciary. I am sure he is very able but he never had to do an interview for the post.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417"> There are other examples that are completely unacceptable and we have seen cronyism rife in the country. This is only another symptom of what is going on which the Government is refusing to end.</p>
