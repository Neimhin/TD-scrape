As Deputy Lynch is not in the Chamber, I call on Deputy Connolly.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Having considered the matter raised, I rule that it is not in order in accordance with Standing Order 31.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 11c, motion re membership of committee; No. 22, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002 – Report Stage, resumed, and Final Stage; No. 6a Taxi Regulation Bill 2003 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 7 p.m.; No. 11c shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Report Stage and Final Stage of No. 22 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m. There shall be no Order of Business within the meaning of Standing Order 26(2) and (3). Any divisions demanded shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 24 June 2003 and, accordingly, the following business shall be transacted in the following order: No. 6a Taxi Regulation Bill 2003 – Second Stage, resumed, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m.; No. 6 Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 – Second Stage, resumed.

Is the proposals for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11c agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22 agreed?

We are at an early stage in terms of the deliberation on amendments presented on this important Bill. The discussion cannot be properly addressed in the period up to 2 o'clock. The guillotining of this Bill is unnecessary and unacceptable.I have just received a telephone call to advise that amendments I tabled that would allow for worker representation, for the many people working in the Houses of the Oireachtas who are not elected Members of either House, will not now be taken by the Minister for Finance. They have been ruled out of order—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Thank you. The Deputy will resume his seat.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Deputy will have an opportunity to contribute. The Deputy will resume his seat when the Chair is on his feet.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Chair is correct, the Deputy will have an opportunity to raise the matter on Fifth Stage.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Of all of the issues on which a guillotine motion may be desirable, this is certainly not one. It is desirable that there will be as much consensus and agreement on all aspects of this legislation. For the Bill to go to a decision when there are many Opposition amendments that will not be debated is undesirable. I suggest to the Minister and the Chief Whip that in the event that the Bill is not concluded by 2 o'clock today, they should adjourn the debate. I know they want to get legislation through before the end of term but this is one Bill where there should be as much agreement as possible.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	18	We would like to make sure that there is sufficient time to debate key amendments, including the one on staff representation. Our own amendment in respect of staff representation is in order and can be taken, but we would like to be sure that sufficient time will be made available for an adequate debate. Perhaps there could be some flexibility on the other side of the House if sufficient time is not available.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	We too agree that the necessary time should be made available for this Bill. On a personal note, I have a vested interest in ensuring that amendments Nos. 55 and 59 in my name are heard before the Bill is eventually agreed by the House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Deputy is not the only Green Party Member with a vested interest.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Very good.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Allow Deputy Boyle to proceed without interruption.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am glad that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is finally using his own words.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We would love to know who wrote that speech last night.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	25	On those terms, we support the views of the other Opposition Parties in asking the Government to allow full and proper consideration of this Bill.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	26	This is an important piece of legislation but perhaps not the most important that has ever come before the House. We appreciate the need for as much consensus as possible. Having said that, we have already had one hour's debate and are proposing to have three hours today on Report Stage, which would appear to be fairly generous. Notwithstanding that, we will agree to adjourn at 2 o'clock.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Is the proposal on the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow agreed to?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	28	There is increasing disquiet about the level of accountability in this House. Yesterday, I participated in what was a sham debate on the 2003 Estimates with the year already half over. Tomorrow we will have a sitting in the absence of the Taoiseach, with no Order of Business, no Question Time and no divisions.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	29	No quorum.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	And no Opposition.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I imagine that this week there will be 20 Government Deputies around the House, close to their monitors.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Allow Deputy Richard Bruton to proceed without interruption, please.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Will there be 20 Opposition Deputies?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Taoiseach has come to the House time and again and said how burdened he feels because he has to work for four hours here in the Dáil, accounting for the way he is managing the country. I say to the Taoiseach and his Ministers, however, that that is their job. They are publicly accountable to the House and trying to constrain the ability of the Houses of the Oireachtas to hold the Government to account is not the way to proceed. Having these sittings with no proper accountability devalues the role of Parliament. If we are going to end the dual mandate and have extra sittings, let us have proper accountability in this House – not these sham Friday sittings that merely absorb time and give the Government the sense that it is getting legislation through. We want a balanced parliamentary system whereby the Opposition can hold the Government to account for its actions. That is what the country needs and that is why we are not happy with the continued introduction of these Friday sittings without a proper Order of Business or other systems of accountability.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Ceann Comhairle will recall that I raised all these arguments last Thursday and pointed out that there would be no Order of Business, Adjournment, Question Time or divisions. The only thing I forgot to say was that there would be no Government Deputies either, as turned out to be the case the following day.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Opposition was not around.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Nothing highlights the farcical nature and fraudulent purpose of Friday sittings better than what happened last Friday. They are designed to clock up the number of days to make the increasingly short sittings look good, as well as giving certain backbenchers who do turn up the chance to chalk up more lines for Vincent Browne's tally at the end of the year. They serve no purpose in terms of parliamentary accountability or scrutiny. There has been a gradual erosion of the number of sitting days as well as a diminution of any standards of accountability in terms of how the Government orders its business. Some 19 Bills have been committed for publication this session, yet as of today only four have been published. I have a copy of the Order Paper for Friday, 5 July 1991, when the Taoiseach of the day had to attend the House to present the Order of Business. This side of the House is in favour of Friday sittings but we want the right to question the Taoiseach and have divisions. In other words, we want to ensure that the Government does its business and has its Deputies present here.It is quite clear that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, and the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, have no intention of mending their ways this side of the summer recess. However, we cannot continue to do our business in this fashion where the Executive is arrogating all powers to itself and has no regard for the standing or role of Parliament. We do not wish to head into a new parliamentary term in the same fashion where the Government clocks up Fridays merely to take the bare look off the paucity of sitting days.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Tomorrow we will have no Order of Business, no questions, no votes, no accountability and probably no quorum if the Chief Whip is on form.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We will have an important piece of legislation the Deputy has been seeking.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Friday sittings are now becoming a tidying up exercise – a way of disposing of troublesome leftovers.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Will the Deputy be around? He was not here last week.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Deputy Gormley without interruption.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Next week, we will devote a total of three and a half hours to the new health strategy – the Prospectus and Brennan reports.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	47	Three.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	49	We are speaking about tomorrow, Deputy.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	50	It is not a laughing matter to anyone on a hospital trolley, yet we will have three hours to devote to that debate. The Government is an absolute disgrace.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I will allow the Deputy a brief comment on the proposal for tomorrow's sitting.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	52	We will have two and a half hours to debate the World Trade Organisation negotiations, so the Government is packing it all together.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That has no relevance to tomorrow's sitting, which we are discussing.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am talking about Friday sittings.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I understand the Deputy is talking about Friday week.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I want more accountability. I want the Government to stop treating this House and the electorate with contempt. We have had enough of its arrogance.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	57	That is sweet coming from the Deputy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	One of the first things that must be addressed is to have the Taoiseach back here on Thursdays in order that he will be accountable to the House and to the Opposition, in particular. That matter still has to be revisited. On Friday sittings, this debate can continue indefinitely but the Ceann Comhairle recognises, as well as we do, the unsatisfactory nature of the conduct of business on Fridays over these weeks. There is a proven case that the matter needs to be revisited, although it is clear that Friday sittings will proceed tomorrow and the week after. We do not oppose Friday sittings but the key question is how we conduct our business on Fridays. We can harangue each other across the Chamber forever and a day, but the case is so self-sustaining and has been so well put that the Government must revisit it. I urge the Government to do so as quickly as possible.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	59	A tradition has grown up in the House, particularly as we come towards the end of a session, to have Friday sittings. Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Rabbitte were both Ministers in the rainbow Administration which sat on Fridays when there was no Order of Business or Question Time, yet there was not a squeak from either of them.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	60	He is making that up.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Ending the dual mandate has changed all that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	62	If the Minister were to address his remarks through the Chair, he might not invite interruptions. Please allow the Minister to continue without interruption.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	63	You can call it what you like, a Cheann Comhairle, but it is playing to the gallery. A few minutes ago, I was asked to provide more time for the passage of legislation. One of the reasons we are sitting on Fridays is perhaps the length of time it takes us to deal with the simple Order of Business every day.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	64	We were promised that 19 Bills would be published in this session, yet we are getting very close to the end of the session and only five have emerged. Against that background, we now have a health strategy which will involve a lot of new legislation coming before the House. Will the Minister for Defence tell us what system will be put in place for fast-tracking health legislation so we will not be waiting interminably for such important legislation, as we have had to wait, for example, for the Residential Tenancies Bill?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Deputy has made his point and he should allow the Minister to answer. We cannot have a debate on legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I am just making the point.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Deputy can ask a question about promised legislation or a promised debate.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Yes, but there has to be a context, a Cheann Comhairle.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	69	We cannot go into debates on these issues or we will be here all day.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18358	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The context is that a lot of promises regarding legislation get long-fingered. The House is eager to have a proper debate on health strategy, which will not be fulfilled by a sham three-hour debate on two major consultants' reports, with another one waiting in the wings.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children said he expected that the major legislation arising from these new health proposals will be passed within 18 months. We are talking about a revision of the Health Act, so what preparations are the Government making to ensure that deadline is met? When can we expect to see the legislation in order that it might meet the Minister's expectation of being passed within 18 months? Given the Government's record, that is not a very long time to ensure the legislation is passed.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Obviously, we will need to have a fairly distinct strategy in order to ensure the enactment of the health strategy legislation, which will be necessary on foot of those reports. One way of fast-tracking it would be to continue to have sittings on Fridays to deal with legislation.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I wish to raise the question of the Immigration Bill with the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith. Last week, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was obliged to withdraw provisions in respect of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill where he effectively incorporated a new Bill at the last minute as it entered Committee Stage. The Immigration Bill was published in February 2002 and wound its way leisurely through the Seanad, taking about 15 months, before completing Second Stage here in May this year.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Yes I do, Sir. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has now published 32 pages of heads of amendments. He proposes to move these on Committee Stage without any Second Stage debate. The amendments may have great merit, for all I know, but it is a completely transformed Bill. When the Minister, Deputy McDowell, was in Opposition he was the most vigilant watchdog of proper parliamentary procedure.

There has been no Second Stage debate on it and that is not an acceptable way to do business in the House.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Bill is currently in committee. We are anxious to see it passed before the recess, if possible. I can understand the Deputy's point of view but, in all fairness, when legislation is going through the House, a big effort is made in all Departments to try to make sure it is as effective and comprehensive as possible. Sometimes it is necessary to have a significant number of amendments.

They are: the veterinary medicines Bill; the Abbotstown sports centre authority Bill; the oil pollution of the sea (civil liability and compensation) (amendment) Bill; the sea pollution (miscellaneous provisions) Bill; the islands Bill; the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (amendment) Bill; the education for persons with disabilities Bill; the water services Bill; the public service management (recruitment and appointments) Bill; the health and social care professionals (regulatory) Bill; the commission of investigations Bill; the European Union (European arrest warrant) Bill; the civil registration Bill; and the Aer Lingus Bill. That list comprises 14 of the 19 Bills the Government promised to publish and have debated in the House, yet we as members of the Opposition have not seen them.

The reason I will not let him answer is that if I allow any Deputy to raise a question about a debate on any particular matter – Deputy Timmins's, for example – I could not then stop you, if you wanted to raise a question about a parish pump in north Kildare, and sought a debate on it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"(a) to produce handbooks and information relevant to the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas for members of the Houses of the Oireachtas,”.This amendment is similar to amendment No. 12 in that it seeks to give the commission a mandate to produce handbooks with information relevant to the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas for Members. The Minister of State will reply that this will be automatically done by the commission but the purpose of this amendment and others is to make sure the commission, when established, is given a direct mandate reflecting the discussions that took place over a long period in the House and in various committees of the House and establishes self-governance and self-management of the Houses in an appropriate way that is user-friendly for Members and staff and, in particular, enables Members to carry out their responsibilities to their electorate.If the commission is driven largely by internal Civil Service management structures, it may have competence but it will fail in its essential mission, which is to communicate what goes on in the Dáil and Seanad. Understandably, in recent years the House has lost much of its public esteem and the development of the commission will provide the Houses with an opportunity to restore self-governance and to enhance the understanding of its operations, reputation and appreciation of what they do among the public.The Minister of State should not be overwhelmed by civil servants laying down what is to happen. This legislation relates to the governance of the Houses of the Oireachtas by its Members. We are elected by the public, unlike civil servants, and it is up to us to lay down the terms of self-governance.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I support the amendment and I am delighted the future Secretary General of the commission is present. Even if the amendments are not acceptable to the Government, he will realise that many of them have merit and reflect the wishes of many Members. It might be appropriate, given that it will be a mistake not to make these amendments, that the concept behind them will be carried forward.Deputy Burton's amendment is worthwhile and reasonable. Recently, a media unit was set up in the Houses, which does an excellent job. We have our own public relations officer. The material produced by the unit is worthwhile, particularly the leaflets explaining the various functions of the House. A video outlining the work of the House has been produced. However, I viewed it recently and I was surprised at how outdated it is. Many of the people featured in the video not only have ceased to be Members of the House, they have passed away to their eternal reward.The commission should be mandated to produce up-to-date material relevant to what is happening in the Houses and a good public relations unit should be established. The Government has 75 spin doctors working away spinning the yarn, trying to put a good slant on the news, which they do successfully on many occasions. It helps when that many people are spinning the same yarn. Unfortunately, the staff in the Houses who try to portray the reality of the Houses of the Oireachtas are part of a small team which faces a difficult task. The Houses are slated by the public on most radio talk programmes every day beginning with "Morning Ireland". They face a difficult job redressing that imbalance. It is extremely important that the commission should be mandated to portray the Houses in the manner they should be portrayed. We live in a democracy and we, as Members, represent the public and have the support of thousands of people. We must be listened to and I regret the Minister of State will respond negatively to the amendment.

It is not unreasonable to ask for clarification of the wording of the amendment. I presume "for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas" means for further dissemination by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.Producing handbooks and information relevant to the business does not have to be an additionality. The quarterly bulletin which is already provided and was received in the past week is a highly glossy document but because it confines itself to statistical information in relation to the number of Bills, sittings and so on, it is very cursory. It does not give the real picture of the workings of these Houses or of the amount of work in which the Members are engaged in their various capacities as spokespersons in the Chamber or in committees. There is a need to revisit the format of that bulletin and to enhance its potential as an information carrier. I support the amendment and commend it to the Minister of State.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I agree with my three colleagues. The Minister of State should accept this amendment. Deputy McGrath is right in that every morning on local and national radio we hear spin and misinformation with regard to this House and no one responds on behalf of the Members. How many times in the past did we hear that TDs were looking for a salary rise again? When Deputies' salaries are under review newspaper headlines show that TDs are to get a rise and when the rise is given large headlines declare that we got the rise. Everyone in the country received the benchmarking pay increase but last week the media were only interested in the politicians' pay rise. We are no different from anyone else. Teachers and everyone else received a rise, and rightly so because the increase was agreed by Government and trade unions, but the public and the media were interested only in politicians. The public does not expect us to do our job for nothing but we hear constant misinformation, and the House should respond to that misinformation. The PR staff in Leinster House do a good job but they could sometimes do a better one. Some misinformation which goes into the public arena is not contradicted and it should be.This House has a small team of PR people and it should be added to. A former Member of the Oireachtas should be appointed on a three or five yearly basis, with the existing team, to represent Oireachtas Members. Such a person would have an understanding of Oireachtas Members' problems. He or she would be able to give the politicians' slant on matters. The PR people who represent the Government are very good.

There is no one to spin on behalf of other Deputies. One hears people on radio programmes presented by Joe Duffy, Marian Finucane or Pat Kenny complaining about TDs. One never hears them complaining about Ministers. The complaints always refer to the poor TDs, who have no back-up except for one secretary.The PR people in the House are excellent and I compliment them on the excellent brochure they have produced. They are very obliging when a TD invites a school to visit the House. They provide brochures very promptly and help in every possible way. I compliment the staff of the House but Oireachtas Members should have more back-up.

The power of argument and good sense might indicate otherwise. It must be very upsetting for Deputy McGrath to watch that video and see so many of his party colleagues who are no longer Members of the House. It is important to update such material. The last election brought in the biggest number of first-timers ever. I am a newcomer to the House and the information the House circulated was very important to us.I agree with Deputy Burton that this aspect of the House's activity is useful and may need to be developed. The task is appropriate to the commission and, therefore, I am accepting the amendment.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I move amendment No. 15:
In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"(a) to develop and publish following wide consultation with members of the  Houses of the Oireachtas a mission statement setting forth its values and aims,”.The purpose of this amendment is to ask that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission be required to develop and publish, after wide consultation with the Members, a mission statement setting forth its values and aims.In the Minister's long amendment the Civil Service head of the commission is asked to produce a strategic three year plan. There is a difference between a mission statement and a management plan for a three year period. A mission sets out what stakeholders wish to do. The stakeholders are all the Members of this House, collectively, leaving party and Government hats off. Governments change from time to time. Our mission statement would set out what we wish to do in terms of doing our job well and communicating to the public whom we serve. We need to get that sorted and to say it for ourselves rather than the Civil Service, however good, saying it for us.In the strategic management initiative, which has filtered down to many public institutions, including schools, a mission statement is now requested to ask people to stand back and think what they are doing and what they want to do.Deputy Ring made an important and significant point in his contribution the other day when he said the additional resources allocated under this Bill, which are relatively generous, should go to the Members of the House. That is a critical question. Those resources could be spent on pomp and circumstance, for example. This House does not have pomp and circumstance, and that is correct. We are a modern republican democracy. We do not go in for the tights and breeches of the House of Commons. We do not wear the signs and signals of office, other than the Ceann Comhairle's simple cloak and collar, and that is correct. However, unless the Members indicate what they want done we may be dictated to.I am glad the Clerk is here. Time and again Members have said in the course of the many debates—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	164	While I am aware of the nature of this debate I must make two important points. Reference should not be made to the present incumbents of the offices of Clerk, Ceann Comhairle or Cathaoirleach. The point can be made in general without referring to present incumbents.The other point, on a comment made earlier in the House, is that the substance of this debate will be recorded and the relevant points will be brought to the attention of the commission. It does not depend on the Ceann Comhairle or the Clerk being here, or, when the Bill goes to the Seanad, on the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad being there. It is just for the sake of debate. It is a difficult debate in that the commission does name the officers, but the present incumbents should not be referred to.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	165	We like to mention you, a Cheann Comhairle.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	166	That is fair enough, a Cheann Comhairle. I was using the title of the office because, as we have said previously, Governments and office holders change – however slowly, as far as some of us are concerned – and we acknowledge that. I want to say at all times how much respect and esteem I have for the civil servants, but this is a question which relates to the Members of both Houses and therefore the Labour Party amendment suggests that the commission develop and publish a mission statement.May I make one further remark? The Members have made an important point very clear, and Deputy Ring made it clear, that the resourcing should be to assist the Members of both Houses and not simply be allocated, without much discussion, to political parties.The Members have made it clear that there are two areas in which they have a specific interest. First, the conditions of employment, and salaries and status, of the secretarial assistants who are the lifeline of every Member of the Opposition, and, second, the question of providing additional research resources to Members of the Opposition and to all backbenchers of whatever party. Those two priorities have been stressed time and again by Members of the House.While the presentation of the strategic three-year plan will presumably identify some of those issues, the Minister of State said yesterday that if the commission so wished it can use the bulk of the money to employ 200 or so extra people. If something like that was to be done, there must be a mechanism where there is consultation and consideration given to that and to the fairness in sharing. I know that will be done by the members of the commission, who, I expect, will be eminent and senior Members of the House, but the legislation should provide for the development and publishing by the commission of a mission statement, as is now done by almost every institution.In the health services there are two reports being published this week and another is in the pipeline. One of the reasons there is this plethora of reports in the case of so many institutions, is that we add on bits continuously to the institutions concerned, and then a year or two later we look back and say, "My God, this thing has grown so much."In the Bill's case, we have a once-off chance to do the consultation at the beginning and set out a clear mission statement so that Members of the House will then know, and hopefully that will allow us to use those extra resources as effectively as possible for the House and for the people we serve. In the context of the current economic climate, the allocation of additional resources by the Minister for Finance is, quite honestly, generous enough.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I support the amendment. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will be magnanimous in accepting this one. We hope he might be because the legislation is deficient. It is important that a commission, which will oversee the running of this House with quite a substantial budget and which will have an important function to fulfil in the sense of upholding democracy and seeing that democracy operates efficiently and effectively within this House on behalf of the people of Ireland, should be asked to produce a mission statement. It is a simple task but it should be incorporated in the legislation. Otherwise it may not happen. Perhaps it will, but it would be incumbent on us to include it in the legislation to ensure that this happens.For instance, following recent education legislation which has been passed in this House, to which Deputy Burton made reference, schools now must produce a mission statement in their report stating what they are about and what are their aims. Is it not only right that the commission, which will oversee the running, efficiency and workings of this House, should be obliged to develop and publish a mission statement concisely stating what it is about?Another important part of this amendment is that it should be developed and published following wide consultation with Members of the House. There are a number of later amendments dealing with this wider consultation with Members of the House by the commission. We cannot over-emphasise the need for consultation with the Members. We must bring all Members with us. We are a wide and diverse House, when one looks at the 166 Members representing parties and non-parties. We have 14 Independents. We have a number of small parties and the long-standing existing parties.It is a broad House with various backgrounds, various principles and various aspirations. If we are to move forward and give the right impression to a public cynical about what happens in here, we must set out clearly what we are about and where we are going. I hope the Minister of State might accept this amendment. If he cannot accept the amendment or the need for a mission statement included in the legislation, perhaps when the Bill goes to the Seanad he might come forward with a better form of words which might cover the same matter. I am not doubting Deputy Burton's prowess as a parliamentary draftsperson—

It does not contain a mission statement which the Deputy wants imposed on the text of the Bill as it proceeds. It is something that will take time, adequate consultation and the involvement of all elected opinion in both Houses. Therefore, it is something one will develop and even when one has, it might not be set in stone and could be revisited.Nevertheless it is important as a guide to the members of the commission, and as a statement to the elected Members of both House and, furthermore, to all who serve on this campus incorporating the non-elected members of staff throughout the Houses of the Oireachtas at all levels. It is important that the mission statement reflects the reality of the working of this institution.I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, of the contribution of his colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe on Committee Stage. I remind him that we would not want the Taoiseach writing the mission statement. If the Deputies remember, this was one of the urgings of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. That is not what is intended.The mission statement must not only have the input but have the ownership of all elected voices in these Houses and indeed an input, quite rightly, on the part of the representatives of those who are not elected voices in these Chambers. I commend the amendment to the Minister of State and I look forward to him responding positively.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I too hope that the Minister of State will accept this amendment. It is important that the commission would have a mission statement. The mission statement quite clearly defines the work of the commission. In the work of the commission, as I pointed out last night, I hope that all elected representatives in this House will be looked after and that they will have the same resources and the same backup.At present the office holders are the ones who have the resources. They have the management and the back-up. I am speaking for all backbenchers. If there is one thing the commission will do, it will bring equality to this House. I do not want to see whatever resources are put in place being given to the political parties. If that is done, backbenchers will not be given the same resources as the officeholders. The parties will gobble up the money and the backbenchers will be no better off. We need equality for every elected Member in order that everyone will have the same resources and back-up and will receive the same support from the Civil Service. I am sometimes critical of civil servants. I would like to see a shared arrangement in regard to civil servants in order that we could have the benefit of their support on this side of the House, particularly when legislation is being discussed. They could advise us as they advise the Ministers. They do an excellent job for the State and the country. In my experience with civil servants, they give one the advice one seeks but no more than that. They assist people on legislation. I hope this amendment will be accepted on the basis that the mission statement will outline the need for equality for all Members.

It is now quite common for Departments to have a mission statement. The Office of Public Works, for which I have responsibility, put a lot of thought and effort into its mission statement. It is not feasible to include sweeping policy statements in the Bill. I can see the merits of the Deputy's proposal but it is something for the commission to consider when it is established. I do not wish to pre-empt what the commission might do because it will be a very esteemed group appointed by both Houses and we know the identity of some of the members already. I am sure the commission will follow existing norms on matters such as mission statements. I am inclined to leave it to the commission and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I thank the Minister of State for being co-operative in tone if not in terms of accepting the amendment. The mission statement is a statement of values and many other parliaments have such a statement. Section 16(4)(a) states: “As soon as practicable after the establishment day . . .  the Secretary General shall prepare and submit to the Commission, for approval with or without amendment by the Commission, a strategic plan for the following 3 year period.”. Subsection (4)(b) states: “the key objectives, outputs and related strategies, including the use of the resources of the Commission taking due account of relevant directions issued by the Government to Government Departments and Offices.”.That three-year plan is perfectly acceptable as an instruction to the Secretary General of the commission. It accords absolutely with Civil Service practice and I accept that it is a good amendment. Can the Minister of State envisage a day when he or the Minister for Finance or any of us would arrive in office with a mission statement which would be the manifesto put to the electorate? Can he imagine the Secretary General saying "Hold on"– which is what Secretaries General say in one way or another –"You will have to have regard for this or that"? Nonetheless, we have a mandate from the electorate and if, as a Minister, one wants to implement change, one would say to the Secretary General: "I will listen to your advice and experience but this is what my Government and I have decided to do and we have a mandate from the people to do it."  That is the missing link. I have no problem with the strategic plan set out on page 17 of the Bill. It is a standard instruction and a good instruction to give to an incoming head of a Civil Service Department, but it is not the same as the statement of values which this Parliament and its Members should produce under the guidance of the members of the commission who will, with one exception, be Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.The production of the strategic plan does not cut across the mission statement in any way. I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this amendment.

Broad policy issues for Government are clearly one matter but the role of the commission will be the management of this House and the facilities it provides for Members. I do not envisage any area in which it would be compromised by overall Government policy.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"(a) to develop a modern and effective parliamentary system which aspires to best practice in the major parliamentary roles of, amongst others–(i) passing timely and appropriate legislation,(ii) scrutinising the expenditure of public money,(iii) assessing the conduct of public policy,(iv) developing an understanding of emerging economic and social issues and making recommendations for change,(v) holding office holders accountable for their decisions,".We are asking that a statement be included in the legislation which will say to the commission that it must look towards modernising, improving and making the House more efficient. Obviously, those issues will be a matter for Members themselves eventually to decide. The commission cannot impose changes in the running of the House without the agreement of the Members. The commission must be a place of research and development; it should examine other parliamentary systems and how they do business. It should introduce ideas and proposals that will modernise this House and make it more efficient.Passing timely and appropriate legislation is a matter on which the commission should introduce proposals. The Minister of State heard the debate during the Order of Business this morning. The Government promised that it would introduce 19 pieces of legislation this term but there have been only five. If one got five out of 19 votes, it would be touch and go whether one would be elected. If Johnny arrived home with his school report showing five out of 19, he would be grounded and would have to improve a fair bit.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I have managed to win a few votes here and there down through the years and maybe that is why I have been a Member of the House for 14 years. It has not been too bad and, hopefully, the light will not go out for another while yet. We will try to keep it burning effectively for another while.Like the mission statement, aspirations should be included in the legislation to set the standard or the trend for this commission. It should not just be bogged down in the mundane matters described in the Bill. These include the commission having a function to oversee ongoing expenditure and to pay salaries and expenses. It is very important that secretarial services and legal advice are provided in addition to back-up facilities. We must be more adventurous than that. We must aspire to streamlining the system and bringing forward ideas that will make the House much more efficient and effective. The Bill should be reflective of the aspirations of the public, which wants us to do our business effectively and efficiently.The amendment calls on the commission to develop a system which aspires to best practice in "scrutinising the expenditure of public money". It could be argued that this provision would infringe on the particular role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is outlined in legislation and in the Constitution. Although this might be so, I feel that the commission should examine how similar bodies in other countries conduct their affairs. Is there a better or more efficient way of operating? If the commission is to be pioneering and to look forward, it should look at other ideas. We do not have all the answers and we do not know how all these things should be done. We should examine other ways of doing business.The amendment calls on the commission to develop a system which aspires to best practice in, "assessing the conduct of public policy", and, "developing an understanding of emerging economic and social issues and making recommendations for change". Perhaps one might claim that the commission will usurp the functions of Members in relation to such matters if this amendment is accepted, but I do not feel that is the case. The amendment suggests that the commission should examine these matters and bring forward ideas and suggestions. It is fine if the House wants to adopt these ideas, or if it does not. The commission's role is to be pioneering and forward-looking.Finally, the amendment calls on the commission to develop a system which aspires to best practice in "holding office holders accountable for their decisions". This provision is probably the one that will lead to the Minister of State saying that he will not accept the amendment, as he will argue that the commission will not be holding office holders to account. Should the commission not be able to bring forward proposals in relation to accountability? Should it not be allowed to improve the mechanism by which office holders become accountable? How often do Members receive letters from the Ceann Comhairle informing them that their questions have been rejected because the Minister has no responsibility in the area? Is it not the duty of the commission to examine this matter and to bring forward proposals on how Ministers should be accountable? Ministers expend taxpayers' money and should be accountable to the House in that regard, regardless of whether the funds are distributed through the NRA or a similar body. Ministers should not be able to avoid answering such questions.I have proposed this amendment as a possible addition to the Bill. I hope the Minister of State understands the context in which I am bringing it forward. I am trying to ensure that the commission will not just be a functional body looking after a few pounds and the secretaries, but that it will also be a developmental body. It should develop the Parliament and the concept of democracy and bring forward ideas and suggestions as to how we can do our business better. Members, who should be engaged in this process, do not have the time to do so, but the commission will have the resources to bring in outside expertise to assist it in bringing forward ideas. The House will then be charged with accepting or rejecting the ideas.

It is in tune with my amendment No. 15 as it seeks to get the best possible outcome from the development of the commission in terms of Members governing the House. Amendment No. 16 makes a number of sensible points and clarifies the areas of parliamentary activity with which the commission should be involved. The issues mentioned in the amendment are perennial aspects of parliamentary business, regardless of the Government that happens to be in power. The question of how best these roles can be performed should be considered. This will be an important area for the commission to consider.

I was a little concerned by the somewhat prescriptive nature of the amendment, which lists five areas which are not under the direct aegis of the commission but which relate to the work of this House. I acknowledge that the wording of the amendment provides for an understanding that the issues are related to the work of the House. I was interested to hear Deputy Burton's comments on this amendment, as I was not sure if she would consider it to be in line with the spirit of amendment No. 15, which she proposed earlier. Her amendment spoke of developing a mission statement setting forth the values and aims of the commission, following wide consultation. Deputy McGrath's amendment, however, seems to address the values and aims of this House.I have no wish to negate the arguments that have been made, nor do I believe I could do so, but I want to point out the small contradiction that has struck me. The basis of amendment No. 16 is its setting out of, "major parliamentary roles, amongst others", and there are others. Perhaps this area needs to be examined over a period of time, but initially it will be the concentration of the commission in full consultation with the Members of both Houses.I do not object to Deputy Paul McGrath's amendment and I wish to record my support for his arguments, which I fully endorse. I appreciate the points he has made. I have made my brief observation because it is important that we concentrate on the actual role of the commission. We should recognise that some of the matters mentioned in this amendment are properly included in the role of the Houses per se. My understanding of the commission's remit is that it will involve an overseeing and overarching position in relation to both Chambers, the associated committees and the wider workings of the House. It will include matters relating to the unelected people who work on this campus. Perhaps Deputy Paul McGrath will respond to my remarks. I am comfortable with the spirit of his proposal and, accordingly, I record my support.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I share the views which seem to underlie the remarks of Deputies Paul McGrath and Burton. I broadly accept that the topics mentioned in amendment No. 16 comprise a proper set of aspirations for the Houses and their Members. Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct to say, however, that they are matters for the Dáil and the Seanad. The Dáil's scrutiny of expenditure, in the widest sense, is at the heart of our parliamentary responsibilities. The matters listed Deputy Paul McGrath's amendment are not automatically proper to the commission, which will be charged with controlling what might be called the administrative tail of the Houses. It will be possible for the Dáil or the Seanad to draw on the commission for studies or proposals. I am sure it will not be beyond the imagination of the Houses to ensure, through their representatives on the commission, that their wishes can be fulfilled. Deputy Paul McGrath mentioned the phrase "make the House", but it is not the role of the commission to "make the House" do anything. The House can do what it wishes.The inclusion of the topics mentioned in this amendment in the functions of the commission as a matter of course would bring us perilously close to crossing the forbidden line in Article 15 of the Constitution. We have to be very conscious of that. It is worthwhile that we should be reminded of our actual business from time to time and Deputies Paul McGrath and Burton have certainly done so in their amendments. The amendments do not represent the proper means of mentioning these matters in legislation, however, and there is certainly no case for including them in this Bill. I am rejecting amendment No. 16 for that reason.

I am glad that he has put on the record that the concept is worthwhile. He also said that they would be able to commission studies in regard to efficiency and the working of the House in general. This could include comparisons with what happens in other parliaments. I withdraw the amendment on the basis of the points made by the Minister of State and in view of the fact that the commission will, we hope, have representatives from all sides of the House in order that they may be able to pursue those matters.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"(a) to appoint the Secretary General,”.This is a straightforward amendment which states that the commission should appoint the Secretary General. When one sets up a particular body it should be in a position to appoint its chief executive. In effect, the Secretary General will be the chief executive of the commission and the board should be able to appoint that person. I am aware that the Secretary General is ex officio a member of the Commission but, nonetheless, the board should have to sanction the appointment of the Secretary General, and this should be stated in the legislation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The Labour Party has tabled a number of amendments dealing with the role of the Clerk and the Secretary General to the commission. I accept the spirit of the amendment. While I do not want to use the word "control", it is the commission, on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which gives the Secretary General his mandate. In spite of this, the entire thrust of the legislation is that the Government is appointing the Secretary General to be the chief executive. While the Ceann Comhairle will be the chairman of the commission, it is the Secretary General who, as accounting officer, effectively calls the shots and commands the budget. The commission acts more in an advisory capacity.While there may be technical problems with Deputy McGrath's amendment, I accept its spirit, which seeks – as we have all done on this side of the House – to keep to the original idea behind the development of the commission, which is that the Houses of the Oireachtas should be in command of their own governance via the commission.This is akin to the position to which I referred earlier in regard to a Minister. Who is the boss in the Department – the Minister or the Secretary General? The Minister is the political boss and the Secretary General is the chief civil servant, which is similar to this situation. The Members of the Houses, however, do not elect the Secretary General, as the people, through the election of the Government, elect the Minister.We have a problem with this matter and have tabled a number of amendments which reflect our approach to it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Amendment No. 17 is not grouped with any other amendments. Section 15, as amended on Committee Stage, deals directly with the position of the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The legislation prescribes that the Clerk of the Dáil will, in fact, also be the Secretary General.As Deputy Burton said, the outworking of this amendment – if it were accepted – would have a consequential effect on a number of other elements within the Bill. As I am not aware of the grouping, I am not conscious of later amendments. That observation is quite valid.This amendment will not, in itself, secure the necessary changes to accommodate the spirit of Deputy McGrath's argument. As with the last amendment, while I appreciate the spirit of what is being argued, I am not sure the methodology is the correct one at this juncture.The commission should have more than a rubber-stamping role in the appointment of the Secretary General. The Minister's intent is clear and determined in the presentation of the legislation. On that basis, while I support Deputy McGrath, I must qualify my support, as I did in respect of the earlier amendment. I hope its spirit will, nevertheless, be understood and accepted. The methodology, however, may have to be revisited.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The Clerk of the Dáil is currently appointed by the Taoiseach once the Minister for Finance and the Ceann Comhairle agree on a nominee. Where they fail to agree, the Taoiseach makes the appointment with the concurrence of the Dáil. Currently the Clerk is ex officio the chief executive of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand it was Fine Gael's position some years ago that the Clerk of the Dáil would be automatically appointed as the chief operating officer.The only modification made in this legislation is that the Minister for Finance is being ousted from the procedure. The chairman makes the recommendation, following consultation with the commission. As the legislation operates on the basis that the Secretary General of the Commission will also be the Clerk of the Dáil, a system where both are involved in the nomination seems ideal to me. I reject the amendment.

Deputy Burton's amendment suggested that the insertion would be made between lines 18 and 19. Perhaps, the Minister would consider whether that is the appropriate place.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 5, line 28, after "facilities" to insert "to members of and political parties represented in each House of the Oireachtas".This is a technical amendment. Its intention is to reflect the actual status of secretarial assistants, which has changed in recent years. The relevant section states "in respect of the provision of secretarial facilities as provided for in the following enactments". My amendment would modify that to read, "in respect of the provision of secretarial facilities to Members of and political parties represented in each House of the Oireachtas."  The secretarial assistants work to the Members of the Houses and to the political parties in the Houses. That has long been the established system. This would simply reflect the current position.The Minister of State may have had to seek legal advice on the status of some secretarial assistants who may be of long standing, but their appointments at the moment are to Members and to political parties, if Members are members of political parties. This may create a problem for the Minister of State from a technical point of view, but, as with the amendment which follows, they are designed to be helpful and to reflect the current position of secretarial assistants. I also have a concern, which I believe has been expressed by Members on all sides of the House, that the role of secretarial assistants should be recognised, acknowledged and, if possible, ultimately enhanced.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	192	This is a technical amendment on which I support Deputy Burton's comments. I agree with her that we must not lose sight, and control, of developments affecting secretaries and the related issue of the facilities and back-up available to Members. Deputy Burton is seeking to have that aspect prescribed in the Bill and I believe that is very worthwhile. In the same section of the Bill, the Minister for Finance is to prescribe rates of pay for secretarial assistants. I ask the Minister of State to look at that also. As he may be aware, the rate of pay for secretarial assistants in provincial locations is reasonable and acceptable. One can find quality people in provincial areas who will work for the level of salary available to secretarial assistants. However, my colleagues in Dublin find it almost impossible to employ staff at the rates of pay on offer. People will obtain better paid and more worthwhile employment elsewhere.We need quality people who are capable of doing the job we want them to do. Some of us are blessed in terms of the quality people we have – they are excellent. However, being located in a provincial area can be a considerable advantage. I ask the Minister of State to consider what it may be possible to do in that regard. Perhaps, before he brings the Bill to the Seanad, he may be in a position to review the overall umbrella which the Minister for Finance has put in place, whereby one cannot pay secretaries at a higher rate without his approval. That element of the Bill needs to be reviewed with a view to giving the commission the jurisdiction to handle the matter in its way.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I support Deputy Burton's amendment which seeks to reflect the de facto position and to put it on a de jure basis in terms of the wording of the Bill. I also fully support Deputy Paul McGrath's comments. Yesterday, on Committee Stage, this issue was raised directly with the Minister for Finance who gave an explanation of the difficulties associated with visiting what I regard as the derisory rates of pay for secretarial assistants within the Houses of the Oireachtas. He made a case and, no doubt, we could engage in the cut and thrust of that on another occasion.I believe part of the difficulty relates to the designation of the positions. Most of those concerned are not properly described within the term "secretarial assistant"– they are much more than that. That needs to be recognised, both in terms of the job description and the level of remuneration those people receive, which I have already described as derisory. It is a great tribute to those in these positions, in all parties, who clearly share the same sense of public service as do their Deputies and Senators. Their role and input is not sufficiently acknowledged or reflected upon in the wider focus on the work of these Houses. I fully concur with Deputy McGrath's observation in that regard – it is a matter which I addressed yesterday to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. In his position as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I hope Deputy Parlon will raise this matter with his senior ministerial colleague with a view to having it addressed and redressed, both in terms of the inadequacies of the terminology used and the level of payment offered. Again, I record my support for the amendment.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment. It needs to be emphasised that the commission is for the benefit of Members. In relation to secretarial services, it is undoubtedly very difficult, as I found two years ago when my secretary took maternity leave, to find people of the required quality. In terms of salary, there are better opportunities available and one can only get people if one is prepared to pay them. I hope the commission will be allowed the authority and power to determine that issue. I understand from my colleagues that there is a particular problem in Dublin in that regard, in terms of alternative opportunities and better pay for secretarial personnel.We also need to bear in mind that secretarial assistants are not appointed to the staff of the Oireachtas but, rather, to the offices of the individual Members who, in turn, are subject to a particular interview board. Unlike the Civil Service, where, once appointed, one remains there, Deputies have to go before the interview board of the electorate after a period of two, three or four years, as the case may be. On the last occasion, the interview board was certainly unimpressed by this side of the House and many people were rejected. That resulted in a situation where the finest of secretaries lost their positions and I saw some of them in tears because there were no jobs for them. They do an excellent job.With regard to my staff arrangements as a Deputy, my wife runs my office at home, without pay, providing an excellent service, free of charge, to the State. I also compliment my secretarial assistant who does an excellent job. In my case, I do not need a second secretary – the State is getting excellent value.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Two for the price of one.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The commission should have the authority to decide on salary levels for secretarial assistants, having regard to urban-rural comparisons. It is not a matter which can be specified in legislation. The insecurity of employment of those concerned, to which I have referred, should be taken into account. If the Oireachtas Member goes out of office, the secretarial assistant loses her job.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I empathise and sympathise with some of the views expressed by Deputies with regard to the position of secretarial assistants, in terms of their employment being linked to the position of Deputies. All of us are conscious of the fact that the interview board to which Deputy Ring referred will sit in judgment on us at some future stage. The pay of secretarial assistants is linked to that of clerical officers in the Civil Service. The recent 8% benchmarking award will go some way to help and there will be no threat in that regard as to how the commission will review matters in future.Two relevant Acts are specifically cited in the Bill. One provides for secretarial assistants to individual Members and the other provides similar facilities to registered parliamentary parties. Quite frankly, I fail to see what further benefit would accrue in either case from the proposed amendment. Indeed, there may also be problems in relation to the phrase "political parties represented in each House". That probably contradicts the provisions of one of the Acts cited in the section, which confines the provisions to parliamentary parties, that is, parties which are registered in the register of political parties and contested the previous election as such parties. Arguably, it might be used in relation to a Member who claims to represent a political party outside these Houses which has been refused recognition by the registrar of political parties, or a party which has never contested an election. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.

In page 5, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:"or in any enactment amending or extending those enactments,".These amendments are purely technical.

It seeks basically to change the relationship with the Minister in this context to one involving consultation as opposed to consent. This Bill is about the self-governance of the Houses.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The amendment has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer. It seeks to remove the requirement for the commission to get the consent of the Minister for Finance when determining, in respect of persons engaged in the provision of secretarial facilities for each House of the Oireachtas, rates of pay, working conditions and pension rights. The removal of this constraint has the potential to increase expenditure and, consequently, it is deemed to be out of order.

We had a discussion with the Minister during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad about the use of appropriate titles in relation to the Houses. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response, given that he has largely taken on board the spirit of the comments we made in relation to descriptions in the Bill such as "in relation to", "appointed by", "a Committee of Seanad Éireann", and so on, and provided for the insertion of more appropriate parliamentary language. The Minister of State has sought to meet the tenor of the Labour Party amendments. I would like him to comment on these amendments and then we can sort out where we are in relation to them.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I move amendment No. 44:
In page 8, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:5.–(1) The Commission shall publish a three year strategic plan as soon as is practicable after its appointment which shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in draft form for consultation, before being finally adopted by the Commission.(2) The strategic plan shall be reviewed annually and a report of progress towards the objectives of the plan will be presented in the Commission's Annual Report.".I propose that the commission should be responsible for publishing a three year strategic plan so that we will not just have the commission rolling along from one day to another and one year to another. It should look forward and create its goals, ambitions and prospects on a three year basis and there should be a roll-over on a regular basis. The strategic plan should be prepared following consultations with the Members and so on. It imposes an obligation on the commission to be forward looking. It should look at how the body operates and what it would hope to do over a period of time rather than being merely functional, paying wages and so on.The proposal is aspirational. It is important that the commission should take on work like this. Unlike the previous amendments the Minister of State rejected on the basis that they would put an obligation on and dictate to the Houses what might happen, it is saying to the commission that it should bring forward the strategic plan and work towards such a plan which will help to streamline what is happening in the House. Therefore, I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment.

This is the natural outworking of an earlier amendment in relation to a statement of intent or a mission statement, which we have already discussed. A strategic plan that would have a three year life currency, with annual reporting and review, will be essential in focusing on the work of the commission and informing all of us, on whose behalf the commission will be engaged, of the progress or otherwise of its efforts. It is a sensible amendment which offers guidance and direction at a crucial time in terms of the Bill's passage. It should be included from the beginning and I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I support the amendment. I referred on Committee Stage to the Minister's amendment, which is now reflected in section 16 of the Bill. It deals with the strategic plan which the Minister is now asking the Secretary General to prepare. If one looks at the amendment tabled by Deputies McGrath and Bruton, one will see that what they are advocating would greatly enhance the strategic plan. The Minister of State may have been given the amendment and not thought about it in much detail because he included a Civil Service amendment. Deputy McGrath's amendment proposes that the strategic plan, as soon as is practicable after the appointment, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in draft form for consultation. The Civil Service alternative states that a copy will be laid before the House. We will get a copy, just as we get dozens and dozens of other reports. At that stage it will be done and dusted and the entire responsibility for the strategic plan will rest with the commission.I have very high hopes for the membership of the commission. They will be senior and respected members of the Dáil and Seanad, including the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. However, it must be said that both of these esteemed people are officeholders. We want the needs of the Members of both Houses to be addressed, whether Government or Opposition Members. Deputies McGrath and Bruton's amendment is a significant improvement and adornment to the much more limited proposal put forward by the Civil Service.I asked earlier on behalf of the Labour Party about a mission statement but for various reasons the Minister of State turned it down. He now has a second opportunity to at least provide for an essential consultation process with the Members of this House via the mechanism Deputies Bruton and McGrath have offered. I urge him to take it. The second paragraph is equally good because it says that the strategic plan shall be reviewed each year and a report of progress would be presented in the commission's annual report.The whole country is in a state of crisis this week, and has been for a number of years, in relation to the debacle that now represents the health service. I am sure the Minister of State would admit that billions have been spent and not much to show for it. Professor Brennan's report refers to the lack of accountability and consultants' contracts. We are saying on this side of the House – one day we may well be on the other side of the House – that some thought should be given to this aspect and consultation with the Members should be allowed. Many problems in the health service were caused by adding bit by bit to this vast service, including community care and so on, which very few people understand. If we were to stand back and take a look at the issue from the beginning and review the plan on an annual basis, we could make a much better job of managing limited resources. The Minister of State was unable earlier to accept the Labour Party's amendment No. 15 on the mission statement. I strongly urge him to accept this amendment.

Accordingly, this section requires the commission to cause an annual report on its activities to be prepared, published and presented to both Houses. It further requires the Secretary General, if requested by either of the Houses of the Oireachtas or a committee of either House of the Oireachtas authorised to make such a request, to furnish on behalf of the commission the requesting body with information on the policies, activities, accounts and any other matter relating to the commission. The essential point is that the strategic plan is not finalised until the commission agrees to it. It gives the full say to the commission.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Thank you, Acting Chairman. You are a very generous man.The Minister of State is missing the crucial elements contained here. The strategic plan should be forward looking over a three-year period and should be prepared and reviewed annually. There should also be consultation with the House before the plan is finally adopted. It is very well for the Minister of State to say that the members of the commission can debate and discuss this report. However, coming back to a point discussed many times today and also on Committee Stage, this House is made up of very diverse groups representing the people of Ireland. We have 166 Members, a number of parties and a number of Independents.There is no mechanism for two Members of this House, probably from the Opposition, to discuss and debate what will be in that report with other Members of this House. If one Member from Fine Gael and one Member from the Labour Party were the two commission representatives from this House on the Opposition side, there is no mechanism for them to discuss a draft report with everybody else in this House. The only mechanism that exists is for the draft report to be laid before the House and we have a debate over a period of hours. Arising from that debate the report can be amended accordingly. The Minister of State is missing the point of how consultation should take place, perhaps because he is in Government and has good access to what is happening there.The same issue will arise in the Seanad. Of the three representatives in the Seanad, probably only one of them will be from the Opposition, which is made up of the Fine Gael group, the Labour Party group and the five Independents. What mechanism will exist for the one Member who will be representing the Seanad Opposition on the commission to discuss a report and get views and ideas from other Members?I ask the Minister of State to reconsider what he has said to us. There is a deficiency and it is not good enough for this report just to be laid before the House by the commission; there must be consultation. Unless we put a mechanism in the legislation to enable the commission to lay the report before the House and have discussion prior to adopting a final draft, it will not happen any other way. I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment. Even if it may not be worded perfectly the Minister should give us a commitment that he will review it and come forward at a later date with a suitable amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	276	This amendment is rightly grouped with the Labour Party's amendment No. 15, which calls for a mission statement and consultation with Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. As I said earlier, many other houses of parliament have this.I cite an example that I raised on Committee Stage. Many Members of this House, including me, are fed up with the disgraceful arrangements concerning the plinth. As finance spokesperson, from September until December, in the worst of the weather of the year, I will be out on the plinth looking like something blown in from the Aran Islands in gale force winds or hovering under umbrellas to protect myself from the rain beside Buswells Hotel. Is that an appropriate way for a modern parliament to present its message to the electorate? The journalists who work in this House do not work for this House, but for the media. Nonetheless they are important stakeholders in this House because presenting our message to the public is done to a significant extent through the media.The Secretary General of this commission may have a different view of the relationship with the journalists who work in this House to that of the Members of this House, who have to have a guarded relationship with the media, but still have to work with them. Why can we not have appropriate arrangements whereby Members are treated with dignity and the members of the press are treated with dignity? In every other parliament in the world there is a place where members of the press can interview members indoors. In the American Senate it is a roped off area on the way into the hall.On entering Leinster House 2000 there is a lovely portico well out of the wind and the rain. The Minister of State suggested putting up some kind of glass case or portacabin. It is absurd when trying to enforce the dignity of the House. This is a requirement on the part of all Members and parties in this House and if we do not have consultation about the strategic plan, we will not address simple issues like this, which do not cost money, but which relate to behaviour and how we treat the Members of the House and the people who work in the House, be they the civil servants or in this case the media.The Secretary General to the commission may not consider this a priority and may take the traditional view that journalists are to be kept in a box and politicians who wish to speak to them had better pray for a fine day. If we cannot address issues like this and effectively as the Members call the shots for reasonable arrangements for our working and for the journalists working in this House, we might as well go home. These three amendments are about consultation so that we will be listened to and I recommend the amendment.

I described the strategic plan as the natural outworking of the earlier proposal on a mission statement, which unfortunately has not yet been accepted by the Minister of State. However, I hope the commission will recognise the importance of it and will set upon that course. The critical importance of the wording of the amendment tabled by Deputies Paul McGrath and Bruton needs to be re-emphasised. That is the consultation process.The makeup of the commission will very likely mean that my colleagues and I will not be represented, which is sad and tragic and I am sure the Minister of State is upset for me. There are many other Deputies who will not have a direct line in terms of the makeup of the commission, and who have every right to secure the opportunity to peruse, to offer opinion and to make an input. That full consultative process is the only means by which that can be achieved. It is very important for members of smaller parties, such as that of the Minister for State, and my own. Both parties are small, but we all have ambition. The Minister of State will realise how very important it is that his position either in Government or in Opposition is protected by virtue of a commitment to consult. It is important, and I lay particular emphasis on it.The points made by Deputy Burton were in relation to what might be addressed in terms of an initial strategic plan, dealing with deficiencies. We spent some time earlier addressing the deficiencies relating to backup and the resourcing of members. Deputy Burton has quite rightly reflected an area which we spent some time talking about on Committee Stage, namely the unacceptable arrangements in relation to Members offering interviews to members of the press. The plinth arrangements are inadequate, particularly given Irish weather conditions.I reassert the points already made. It is imperative that that particular objective is provided for in the very first commitment of the commission in terms of address and redress of the current inadequacies of these Houses.I thank the Minister of State and his officials present for the provision of information in relation to the upcoming arrangements for the provision of creche facilities in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I commend the initiative. It was already in train, and those facilities will be here on the resumption of the new term when we return after the summer recess. It is something to be welcomed. Good ideas are being worked on in the Minister of State's Department and elsewhere. This is an opportunity to bring together the collective weight of all of the good ideas that are shared within these Houses. I urge the Minister of State to support and accept the amendment as presented. Consultation is the key.

The Deputies make a very strong case. It will certainly be a matter for the commission, which will have very substantial resources over the course of its three years.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Not quite. The Deputies will be able to press their case in those areas. Regarding the strategy statement, it will be – as in a Government Department – the responsibility of the Secretary General to put the statement to the commission and achieve consensus at that stage. The amendment if passed would mean that there would then be a requirement for the commission to lay that draft before each House before finalisation, before each House. Perhaps that would work, but the commission will have to give its approval when the statement is put before it by the Secretary General. One cannot have even a small committee of ten people drafting. One person drafts and somebody agrees. If one were trying to draft a statement within this House, and 166 people insisted on having an input, that could take a very long time, and might not make a lot of sense.Both approaches have a lot in common. The general thrust of this Bill is to put the commission in the same relationship with its Secretary General as that between Ministers and their Secretaries General. The interactive process is more likely to be productive where it involves a small group, such as the ten members of the commission, who have formal responsibility, rather than with a big committee of 166, for example. I take it as read that the annual report would cover progress with regard to objectives. That is normal with any report. Accordingly, I cannot take the amendment on board.

In page 8, line 20, after "publish" to insert ", not later than the 30th day of June in each year,".This is a continuation of our earlier discussion. Our objective in relation to the commission is to get accountability and consultation with the members of all parties and no parties within this House. As the Minister of State is no doubt fully aware as a business person and a farmers' representative, unless one gets a report on a timely basis, reading it is political archaeology, rather than reading something current and up-to-date.The purpose of the amendment is to insist that the report should be published at the latest date, not later than 30 June of each year. The Minister of State no doubt knows that most commercial organisations publish reports about four months after the year ends. It would be reasonable in the context of public service requirements being more onerous, to allow for a six-month period. It would mean that the reports would be timely and informative, and therefore much more meaningful to the Members of the House.The accountability function is critical. It is like the debacle in the health services. If we could only have had regular reporting of what was going on, we might not be in the situation we are now in. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, might not be in the quagmire he has been in, spending more money to produce nothing. The purpose of our amendment is to assist the commission in providing up to date reports for the purposes of accountability and consultation. I commend the amendment to the House.

I would like Deputy Burton to address the issue of the date. Why is it 30 June? While I appreciate the principle of the arguments she has put forward, I am concerned about the date as the Dáil usually goes into recess for the summer the following week and it is a time of great panic and pandemonium on the Government benches in terms of rushing legislation through and harassing the Opposition in every way possible. I would like to hear the arguments for setting that date. The other matter is a technical point. It will create a problem if we do not drop the words " in each year" because they are already included in the text and it is not necessary to include them twice. The more critical point, before I finally support the actuality of the amendment, is why the date is 30 June. I support the argument in principle.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I support this amendment. It is necessary to put the onus on the commission to produce this report within a certain timeframe. Deputy Ó Caoláin raised a couple of queries. He asked what is the position on paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 will be deleted by way of a later amendment, thereby eliminating the difficulty to which he drew attention.In regard to why 30 June is set as the deadline, it is half way through the year. It is six months after the end of the year and it is appropriate that a body be required to produce its report within six months of the year end. Given that many financial reports, particularly those of State companies, drift on for quite a long time, it is important to set some limit.The point about the Dáil going into recess soon after that is well made. However, it is important to set some date. If we were to bring it forward to 30 May, there would be some other objection. It is reasonable to give the commission six months to produce and publish the report and have it laid before the House. If the commission is to take on board some of the sentiments expressed earlier in the debate on consultation, that six-month period would be necessary to enable consultation to take place and matters arising from that consultation to be written into the report. Therefore, I see 30 June as being particularly appropriate. The matter would come up for discussion later on in the House or before a committee of the House at an earlier date if desired. I support the amendment.

It further requires the Secretary General, if requested by either of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or a committee of either House of the Oireachtas authorised to make such a request, to furnish, on behalf of the commission, the requesting body with information on the policies, activities, accounts and other matters relating to the submission. As the commission is being set up on 1 January, the annual report will have to be published before 1 July of that year. It is standard procedure for bodies to publish an annual report and to publish it within six months. This practice is operated by the Courts Service, Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the family support agencies. I cannot accept this amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that publication of the annual report within six months is a specific requirement. The wording in the Act is rather loose. If the Minister reads it, he will see what I mean. In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin's comment, 31 December is suggested because that is now the financial year end for all State bodies. For some purposes it used to be 5 April or 31 March, but there is now a uniform accounting year in all State and public bodies.In the commercial sector, particularly for public companies, annual reports are normally published between two and four months after the year end. As Civil Service auditing and accounting requirements are in some instances more detailed and onerous, it is reasonable to allow Civil Service institutions a leeway of a couple of extra months. I suspect that Deputy Ó Caoláin believes that the time period is too long. I would hope that as Civil Service accounting improves, the period could be reduced but I believe a period of four months would be highly reasonable and I would imagine the internal accounts for the commission would probably be ready two and a half months after the year end with a further month allowed for auditing. That would make it possible for the report to be published within four months of the end of the year. To require that in the legislation right now might be excessively onerous, given the current state of Civil Service structures and reform of the Civil Service. I therefore agree with setting a timescale of six months after the year end. The purpose of the Labour Party amendment is to tie that down to 30 June in section 6(1) of the Bill.

An earlier date would be more appropriate and would allow for a more focused debate on the report.The Minister has not addressed the question of phraseology raised by Deputy McGrath. It is a small point but I would have thought the words "not later than 30 June" might be better inserted after the word "report" rather than after the word "publish". The words "in each year" would then be superfluous. However, the key focus of what I sought to raise has been addressed and it is acknowledged that an earlier date would be preferable. However, I support the amendment in principle, as I have others that challenged me somewhat.

That is within the six months. I understand that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is prepared by the end of March under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act. There is nothing to prevent the strategy statement by the commission having an earlier date.

The section he read out refers to the first annual report. Our amendment would make that apply to every year. That is why I believe our amendment is a better form of wording. One of the things that may be said to the commission, and I take Deputy Ó Caoláin's point, is that the reporting date and publication date could be brought forward. I appreciate there may still be difficulties in terms of the secretaries Act and so on, but the date could be brought forward in the interests of accountability and the usefulness of such reports. If, when this commission has been in existence for a year and a half, we are still standing out in the rain on the plinth, we will want to know why, and we will want to know whether we will be waiting for another year. At the end of a year and a half of discussion on the commission, we are still standing out in the rain on the plinth. We want to know why and we do not know whether we will have to wait for another year.

In page 8, line 42, to delete "an acting" and substitute "a deputy".We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. The Bill uses the term "acting chairperson" whereas the title "deputy chairperson" would be better, as that title is normally used.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We discussed this extensively on Committee Stage and I thought we had put it to bed. My only objection was the Deputy gave a misleading impression of the job. "Acting chairperson" is a more honest term in regard to overcoming the notion that the role only involves presiding over or calling the odd meeting. At the end of the day, we are referring to a small group who will work and interact with each other on a regular basis. A chairperson of an active body knows full well that it is required to keep it running smoothly and the body is highly unlikely to choose an acting chairperson that is not acceptable. However, I would like to circumscribe the chairperson's choice statutorily or replace him for this purpose by a group. There is no prohibition under this section on the chairperson consulting the commission members in advance of choosing and writing to the selected member. I do not support the amendment.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	298	We can all learn from each other and, for example, the separation of powers adopted in Ireland has been applied in the British jurisdiction in recent days. The Lord Chancellor will no longer be a legislator, the head of the judiciary and a member of the executive at the same time. We could also learn from this. Yesterday the British Prime Minister appeared in the House of Commons at the request of the Speaker to address issues that were of concern to the members. It is not often that the Speaker calls the Prime Minister to the House of Commons but he had to appear when he was summoned. It is all very well to debate the title of the chairperson of the commission and his or her deputy, but the powers they are given is a much more important issue. I would like the Ceann Comhairle to be given power to ensure the independence of the House. Money can be found for the many expensive tribunals and inquiries but they would not be necessary if the Houses were resourced properly and the Ceann Comhairle was given the power to ensure whatever Government is in office is accountable to the Members. The setting up of the commission is a good step but I would like the Ceann Comhairle to have a new role in that regard.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Section 7 states there should be an acting chairperson of the commission who will be appointed by the chair of the commission in writing and he or she will take on various functions and so on. The title is inelegant in terms of the everyday usage. "Acting chairperson" is not a term used by public bodies in Ireland. "Deputy" is the word that is used. We have deputy leaders of political parties, deputy chairs of commissions and so on. "Acting" implies a chairperson is temporarily absent whereas the appointment will be made in writing by the Ceann Comhairle. Why not call a spade a spade? It is not as if the Ceann Comhairle will slip out for two minutes while chairing the commission and someone else will act in his place. The reason for the appointment is if the Ceann Comhairle is away or busy with other business, he or she will have a deputy. Ordinary people and many Members would understand the term "deputy chairperson" more easily. Why not accept the amendment? It provides a much better use of language and it accords with everyday use of language in Ireland.

In page 9, lines 1 and 2, to delete "chairperson" and substitute "Commission".The Government wants to nominate both the deputy chairperson and the chairperson. This is not acceptable because the commission, together with the chairperson, should appoint the deputy chairperson. If the commission is doing its job and working for the Members of the House, by and large, there will not be votes. The Secretary General will bring forward proposals, following which there will be discussion and consultation with Members back at the ranch and, hopefully, there will be agreement on most issues. Why not apply the same procedure to the appointment of the deputy chairperson rather than have the Government, through the chairperson, make the appointment? The commission comprises esteemed members, including the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Secretary General of the commission and senior Members of both the Dáil and the Seanad. They are big enough to be trusted to elect a deputy chairperson.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Following acceptance of Deputy Burton's previous amendment, the Minister of State needs to introduce amendments to the wording in page 9, line 3 and page 9, line 10. He will have to change the word "acting" later in the Bill to "deputy" consequential on the previous amendment being made. I do not know what mechanism we have for doing that at this stage. Will the word "acting chairperson" automatically change to "deputy chairperson" or must an amendment be moved in each case? Perhaps the Acting Chairman could clarify the matter.The amendments proposed by Deputy Burton and me amount to the same thing. The Bill, as initiated states: "As soon as may be after the establishment day, the chairperson shall appoint in writing a member of the Commission, other than the Secretary General, to be the acting chairperson."Deputy Burton is saying that the commission, rather than the chairperson, shall appoint the deputy chairperson. My amendment proposes that the chairperson shall appoint a deputy chairperson following consultation with the commission. This amounts to the same thing. I believe my wording is slightly better because while it would be difficult for the commission to make an appointment in writing, it would be possible for the chairperson to do so.The commission must consult within its membership and with Members of the House. In this case, the commission should consult within itself. We do not want a chain of command whereby the Minister appoints the chairperson of the commission and the chairperson appoints the deputy chairperson. We do not want a line of command starting in the Taoiseach's office and coming down the line. There must be consultation with the commission. These are reasonable amendments. We are asking for a small bit of consultation, not for the sun, moon and stars.When we see what is happening in Northern Ireland and hear talk about devolved government and shared powers, it is ironic to read in this Bill that the Government of the day will dominate what will happen within this commission. These amendments will ensure, in a small way, that there will be consultation. They will not guarantee a sharing of power but there will, at least, be consultation.I hope the Minister of State will continue to be magnanimous and recognise that the Bill contains a small element of dictatorship, with the chairperson appointing in writing a deputy. The section should say that the chairperson shall, after consultation, appoint in writing a deputy. That provision must be built into the Bill.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I wish to support Deputy Burton's amendment. I respect Deputy McGrath but I do not accept his point that the amendments are one and the same. The critical difference is members of the commission having a say, not just the opportunity to offer an opinion. There is a substantial difference.The practice Deputies Burton and McGrath are seeking to address – I acknowledge they are both trying to address it although I prefer Deputy Burton's amendment – is already happening in this Chamber. The Ceann Comhairle has the opportunity to appoint those, other than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who will occupy the Chair in the absence of both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I understand that the practice heretofore has been that the respective parties are asked to nominate. The power to appoint is in the hands of the Ceann Comhairle. I have no doubt that the current occupant of the Chair, Deputy McGinley, has the imprimatur of his party and I presume Deputy Sherlock, who occupied the Chair earlier, has the imprimatur of his. However, with the development of new political representation in this House following last year's general election, the same opportunity was not granted to the Technical Group. A member of the technical group, Deputy Cowley, for whom I have the highest regard and respect, sometimes chairs proceedings in the Chamber. He was appointed by the Ceann Comhairle without any consultation with the members of the Technical Group. The Ceann Comhairle did not consult the Independent Deputies or the Green Party Deputies and he certainly did not consult the Sinn Féin Members. This is the very thing that Deputies Burton and McGrath seek to address and they are absolutely right to do so.It is important that the constituent elements in the House recognised to be in Opposition, that is Fine Gael, Labour and the Technical Group, should have their respective positions respected and that the commission itself retain the power and authority to appoint a deputy chairperson. It is unfortunate that the two-tier approach has been adopted regarding the occupants of the Chair in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I respect everyone who takes up that position and I would not covet it for a moment, nor perhaps would any of my colleagues. However, there is a principle involved. No consultation took place and a selection was made by the Ceann Comhairle alone. I do not want to see that practice, with which I disagree, replicated in the commission, whereby the chairperson or cathaoirleach of the commission would appoint someone of his or her choice to be the new deputy chairperson. The decision should rest with the commission and with all its members. They, collectively and democratically, should select the deputy chair.There is an important principle here and I have given an example of how it can happen and is already the case in this Dáil. Members do not have the consultation Deputy McGrath argues for and they certainly do not have the right to be part of the decision making process, as Deputy Burton's amendment proposes.I fully support amendment No. 51. I respect and accept the spirit of amendment No. 52 but the former amendment firms up matters more strongly for the reasons I have outlined. Many Members, probably all of the Members now present, are unaware of the power of appointment to occupy the position where Deputy McGinley currently sits. If Fine Gael and the Labour Party have engaged in consultation and had the power of collective appointment by their respective leaders and parliamentary groupings, the same facilitation should have been offered to the Technical Group, which is no less a recognised entity in this Chamber.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I hope there is not a split in the Technical Group. We are used to that in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour over the years. I listened with interest regarding the appointment and I will make no further comment. It could be a question of the old boys' or old girls' club.On the chairmanship, my personal view is that the Ceann Comhairle should not be chairman of this commission on the basis that he or she is too busy in this House. This will be a very serious appointment. The chairperson of the commission will have to give it nearly full-time attention, considering he or she will be dealing with pressures on a day-to-day basis. Issues will be raised every day. The commission may need to meet on many occasions, perhaps two or three times a week or even six of seven times a week because there may be many problems to be dealt with. The chairmanship should be a full-time job and it should be the only job that he or she has. If we are serious about this commission and its workings, we should appoint a chairperson for the three years but, with no disrespect to the Ceann Comhairle, whoever he or she may be, it should not be the Ceann Comhairle because he or she is too busy.On the appointment of the chairperson, we do not want this to be another job for the boys or girls, another chairmanship for the Government party of the day. We do not want that to happen. I want this commission to work. This is an opportunity for the House and for the Members to make sure that once and for all we have representation on this commission, that there is fairness on the commission and that this will not fall down on political grounds or on any decision taken on party political lines. We want this commission to be fair to every Oireachtas Member and to make sure that there is equality. I hope we do not go down that road of political appointments because it is not the way to go.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	306	On any suggestion that the Ceann Comhairle is a member of the Government, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison, was strong yesterday evening in pointing out, to both Deputy Burton and Deputy McGrath, the total independence of the Ceann Comhairle's position. We are talking here about a small group which would be working and interacting with each other on a regular basis. The deputy chairperson will be appointed in advance, but it is wrong that Deputy McGrath mentioned dictating etc. It is wrong that we, in the House, or that the Bill would dictate to the chairperson as to who he should consult. As with any chairperson I have ever known, whether of a big or small group, being chairperson is about consulting and getting consensus.In terms of appointing the chairperson, it is not up to the Bill to insist or dictate with whom the chairperson consults. I assume that in appointing an acting chairperson who will carry on the business in the absence of the chairperson and keep the business flowing freely, it is sufficient that the chairperson and the commission should have discretion. The amendment will not help the situation.On the suggestion that it will be a political appointment or that the chairperson, who will be the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, will be biased in terms of who he consults with or who he appoints, I do not see the benefit of dictating that he should consult. It would be normal practice that he would consult on whatever appointment would be made because clearly there is no point in appointing somebody who is not interested in, or does not want to take up, the job. For that reason I would assume that those consultations would take place as part of a sensible decision.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The Minister of State stated that we should not dictate to the chairman how he or she does business. This Bill is about dictating. We are laying down the criteria by which this commission will work and telling the Secretary General, the chairman and everybody how they should do their business. We want to ensure that, in appointing an acting chairperson, there is consultation.The second point the Minister of State raised, that he expects there will be consultation, is important. As the sponsoring Minister of this Bill, he has now given a commitment to this House that he expects the chairman to consult with the members of the commission before he appoints the acting chairperson. That is an important commitment. While the Minister has stated he will not accept the amendment, the chairperson, who will have read the Official Report and how we dealt with this matter, will have to take into account the Minister's statement that he should consult the members of the commission before making the appointment. I will wait with bated breath to see to what extent the Minister of State's commitment, given today, will be followed through. It is a good commitment and I thank him for it. It is the best he could do, given that he could not accept the amendment. I welcome the sentiments he expressed and I know that the chairperson will follow through on them.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am very concerned about some of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon's, responses. I think he wants to be helpful and I acknowledge that, although he has been captured to a degree by the Civil Service. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison, spoke yesterday of the independence of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach in carrying out their function and role, just as the Acting Chairman, Deputy McGinley, although he is a member of a political party, will be scrupulously fair in carrying out the functions of the Chair. However, that is not the point I wish to make on this section.Under this Bill it is proposed to give the Houses of the Oireachtas independence but then we spancel it by ensuring that the Government is in complete control in dominating the nominations to the commission, because the Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad are usually members of the Government parties – occasionally they are members of other parties for particular reasons. What we want to ensure, in the operation of the commission, is that all the Members of this House, the backbenchers and members of the Opposition, have a fair and honest chance to have an input.I raised already the drastic situation of people on the plinth, in the wind and rain. Let us talk about another practical example, the opening arrangements of this House, where one cannot get into the House before 8 o'clock in the morning. What would be wrong with us being able to hold meetings from 8 o'clock in the morning, particularly people who live in Dublin and people who stay overnight. We could then go home much earlier in the day.All these items are minor reforms that Members in this House have been talking about for years, but to no avail. Now that we have governance of our own affairs, whether we are backbenchers, Front Bench Deputies, Opposition spokespersons or Government backbenchers, if we cannot consult and have an input into this commission, we will basically be replacing a very rigid system for another potentially equally rigid system.The problem for the Government is that it cannot trust the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is control at its worst and we see it all the time in this Government. If it wants to do something, it gets a consultant to tell it what it is thinking, and that costs a fortune.The ten people who will comprise this commission will be very eminent people. It will not include people like me – I am too new in this House – or the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, regardless of what side of the House he is on after the next election.

Why does the Ceann Comhairle have to perhaps receive a telephone call from the Taoiseach of the day or the Minister for Finance of the day directing him or her to appoint this or that person? Why not allow the ten or 11 eminent members of the commission decide? If the chairperson of the commission is from the Government side, even though he or she is acting independently, will the Minister of State not agree that the deputy chairperson should be from the Opposition? That would increase the collegiality of the commission and help it to work for everybody in the House, which is what we all desire.

I have given the example of the situation in relation to the position of Cathaoirleach or Ceann Comhairle of the Chamber. It is an absolute requirement not only that consultation take place. I have given an example of where consultation has not taken place in relation to one of those appointments. There is the need to empower the new commission so that its members understand that they have functions, responsibilities and the power to make decisions. One of the very basic decisions that they could take, given that there is already the appointment of the Secretary General as the appointment of the chair of the commission, these are not things that they will be able to determine, these are already enshrined in the legislation. At least, in Heaven's name, let us show some intent to empower them by allowing them to make the democratic selection of the deputy chairperson. I do not think it is a lot to ask. It is not a case of consultation only, they should have that democratic power among their number and get on with the business. For the life of me, I cannot understand the Minister of State's hesitancy on this matter.

It has already been decided that the Ceann Comhairle will be the chairman. The Ceann Comhairle will be obliged to nominate a deputy or an acting chairman at the outset from among the commission members. The Deputy's amendment would impose a provision that he or she should appoint a member of the Opposition.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I move amendment No. 53:
In page 9, to delete line 21 and substitute the following:"(c) a member of the staff of the Commission elected by such staff;”.This is in many ways a critical amendment to the Bill. There are hundreds of staff working at different levels in the Houses of the Oireachtas. This Bill is to do with the governance of the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. In all State and semi-State institutions, there has been an acknowledgement for decades, particularly in relation to semi-State companies, that staff members should be represented in the governance of those companies. The Labour Party wishes to extend this principle to the commission by an election by the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas provide a service at many levels, from the senior civil servants who run the Dáil, to the people who work as highly-valued secretarial assistants, to the people from the Office of Public Works who look after the building, the people who come in early and late to clean the building, all the people who work in the Dáil and who take considerable pride in the appearance of the building, who show visitors around the building, who provide security and services.It seems extremely old-fashioned that we should agree on self-governance and decide not to include members of staff in the governance of the commission. It must be borne in mind that the Secretary General, who is the boss of the civil servants in the Dáil precincts, is an integral member and chief executive of the commission. The proposal is to have a staff member chosen from a relatively small group running the affairs of the commission. We propose that the Secretary General would not be a member of the commission but rather would be the chief executive, entitled to attend the commission. As in the Civil Service, he or she would carry out the function of the chief executive. The Secretary General's place would be taken by an elected member of the staff. We feel this is an appropriate arrangement. It would also be in order from a legal point of view because it would not impose any extra cost on the Minister for Finance. I find it difficult to believe that the Government, particularly Fianna Fáil, has decided that the staff of the Oireachtas, who are integral to the proper functioning of the Houses, will not be represented on the new commission. It is particularly strange when one considers that the Taoiseach has based his political career on promoting social partnership.I do not want to revisit the entire Committee Stage discussion on this matter. Members of the committee spoke about the services rendered to them by various well-conducted and courteous members of staff. The officials serve Members, of all political parties and of none, with efficiency and courtesy. They tend to spend far more of their working lives in this building than many public representatives do. They have a job for life, potentially, after an interview with the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners, but we are interviewed far more frequently, as Deputy Ring said earlier.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	324	That is right.

As many members of staff have been in the service of the Oireachtas for up to 40 years, they are exceptionally well-versed and knowledgeable regarding the different features of the running of the Houses. The first of my many working experiences was in the GPO as a very junior clerk.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	327	No, I was not there in 1916, but it feels as if I was because it is so long ago. As an accountant who worked in many public bodies and Government Departments when I was in private practice, I have always felt that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas has a highly hierarchical management structure. The way in which the Oireachtas conducts its internal business has a very hierarchical air to it. A decision to allow a member of staff, elected by the staff, to be appointed to the commission would bring the operations of the Oireachtas, as well as the atmosphere of the Houses, into the 21st century. It would allow staff to be represented, to have a voice and to offer insights and wisdom on the operation of the Oireachtas.I see that we have been joined by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, who knows that his predecessor as Minister valued the input of worker directors and their insight into the running of various transport companies owned by the State. Two weeks ago, the Minister met the board of Aer Rianta, which includes staff representatives, to discuss the future of the company. I am asking that the several hundred civil servants who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas be represented on the commission. It is a question of modern employment rights and of bringing the style, structure and governance of this House into the 21st century.A number of specific issues are very important to the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. These include the questions of staff facilities, such as a crèche, and access to conditions of employment which are enjoyed in other parts of the Civil Service. The terms and conditions of employment are negotiated by staff, particularly by trade union representatives. Participation in the working of the commission would allow staff members to be advised by other staff and trade union representatives in order that they could take part in the development of the Houses of the Oireachtas. We want the House to be open for longer hours, so that we can start business at 8 a.m., and we want to encourage the public to visit the House. A representative of the staff on the commission would give a valuable insight into these matters. We mentioned earlier that the commission should be accountable and consultative. It is essential that it should have staff representation.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The two amendments we are debating, which involve much the same thing other than the numbers suggested therein, are at the core of this Bill. Deputy Burton is proposing that the commission should include one representative of the staff, whereas the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Richard Bruton suggests that there should be "2 members representative of the non-elective staff of the Houses".The Acting Chairman, Deputy McGinley, has been a Member of this House for longer than me. I have been impressed, in the 14 years I have spent in this House, by the courtesy, efficiency and dedication to work of all the staff of the House. The ushers smile and wave when one arrives at the gate to begin one's business. One is greeted by more ushers when one comes through the door. The officials in the general office could not be more helpful. I mentioned last night that if one is looking for a parliamentary question one submitted two or three years previously, the officials in the office will find it and produce it, even if one is not sure of the exact date. If one is looking for a document about which one has vague details, the staff of the Oireachtas Library will ensure that it is in one's pigeon hole within half an hour.The members of staff of this House, including ushers, civil servants, the lads who perform a courier service by carrying our boxes, ministerial staff and those who gather leaves on the lawns and keep the House looking well, are tremendous. They are part of this House and have a definite role in it. Staff and Members collectively enable the democratic wheels to roll. The House could not function without its staff. It would be a very different House without the courtesy shown by the staff, above and beyond the call of duty. It is unfortunate and to the shame of the Minister and the Government that this Bill is turning its back on the staff. There are 226 elected representatives in the Oireachtas, but there are probably 800 or 900 members of staff working here, if one includes those who provide secretarial assistance, etc. We are turning our back on the staff and saying that they do not count at the commission table where the operation and decorum of this House over the next number of years will be decided. Is that the way to do business in a modern society? Is it the way we should treat those who are an integral part of the House?Let us look at what happened in State companies when we involved worker-directors and so on. It helped to make them work more efficiently. Yet, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2003 does not provide for staff representation on the commission.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The essential purpose and primary focus of this legislation can be summarised as follows: to provide a new and enhanced legislative basis for the control of the operation of taxis, hackneys, limousines and their drivers; to place the control of those services under the auspices of one new independent national authority, the Commission for Taxi Regulation and to establish the commission on a statutory basis; to create the framework for the application of the highest standards to the vehicles being used as small public service vehicles, their drivers and operators; and to establish, on a statutory basis, the Advisory Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation. The Bill will establish the framework necessary to ensure that the services provided by taxis, hackneys and limousines can develop and improve to the extent that they can stand comparison with the best anywhere in the world.The operation of the various services that are the subject of this Bill form part of the overall provision of transport services throughout the country. Taxis form a critical element of the public transport system in urban areas. They complement and enhance the services provided by buses and trains by providing door to door services, primarily targeted at single person hirings. Their services are especially necessary to meet the needs of disabled persons. Unlike the public hire, usually urban based services of taxis, hackneys operate throughout the State. They provide a particularly important role in the provision of private hire services in rural areas with dispersed populations. Limousine services enhance our tourist industry and provide quality transport services to business interests.These services currently operate under a legislative code that dates back to 1961. The specific parameters that apply to those services are set out in 30 statutory instruments made intermittently over the past 40 years. The Bill will provide for the replacement of that code. It presents a legislative framework that, for the first time, will be focused exclusively on the services provided by all small public service vehicles. It will also provide for the creation of new structures that will apply dedicated control to the services given by the operators of those vehicles and will give an advisory role to service providers and user interests in relation to the future direction of those various services.The Bill will facilitate the introduction of a regulatory framework to ensure a good quality, professional service by existing and prospective small public service vehicle service providers alike. It will provide for the introduction of appropriate and evenly applied standards for all categories of small public service vehicle to facilitate improved uniform standards of service for the public.The Commission for Taxi Regulation will provide a national focus for the future operation of small public service vehicles. It will oversee the development and deployment of new standards to be applied to all vehicles, their drivers and operators. The commission will be a public body that will be independent of the Minister. This independence is specifically provided for in the legislation.The Bill will also see the establishment of the advisory council on a statutory basis. I have taken the opportunity presented by this Bill to introduce minor amendments to two provisions in the Road Traffic Act 2002. These relate to the correction of a minor error relating to the levels of fines established in section 23 of that Act and to bring greater clarity to the introductory comments provided for in Part 1 of the First Schedule to the 2002 Act.Before I deal with the main provisions contained in the Bill, I wish to refer to two issues that have been central to public debate in relation to taxis in recent months. The first relates to the fall-out of the decision taken by the last Government to liberalise access to taxi licences. The House will recall that the decision to remove the restrictions on access to taxi licences was taken to comply with a High Court decision that created the legal position by which the application or retention of such quantitative controls could not be maintained.As a direct result of that decision the number of taxis operating nationally today is three times greater than was the case under the previous controlled system. Taxi licence numbers have increased from 3,934 in November 2000 to in excess of 11,600 at the end March 2003. I appreciate that this has created significant challenges for taxi operators and has given rise to certain negative comments in relation to taxi standards. It is, however, the case that between 1978, when quantitative controls were first introduced, and the adoption of liberalised entry in November 2000, debate on taxi services related almost exclusively to the question of licence numbers. The Bill that I present to the House today marks a watershed and an act of completion in relation to the issue of taxi numbers. It does not provide a mechanism to allow for the reintroduction of quantitative controls on taxi licence availability, rather it places a clear premium on the application of quality considerations to taxi services and to the services to be provided by hackneys and limousines.The second issue to which I wish to refer is that of compensation for loss of value resulting from the removal of quantitative controls. The legal position in relation to compensation for loss of value of taxi licences was originally established in the High Court in 1992. That position was confirmed following the decision to liberalise access to taxi licences in 2000. There is no legal duty on the Government to pay compensation in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation.While there can be no question of compensation being paid, the Government recognises that the decision to liberalise access to taxi licences gave rise to hardship for certain people. To address that concern, an independent panel was established to examine in general terms the nature and extent of any such hardship. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the panel and has agreed to the implementation of those recommendations on a phased basis. Any payments to be made as a result will not represent compensation, but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by taxi licence holders arising from the liberalisation of the taxi market.The report of the hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons is being progressed as quickly as possible to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis. In this regard, I met the FAIR organisation in recent days to discuss this matter with it in detail. Every effort is being made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of the panel recommendations as soon as possible.I wish to draw the attention of the House to the main policies and principles which the Bill promotes. The principal function of the Commission for Taxi Regulation, which I presume will be known as the Taxi Regulator, will be the development and maintenance of a regulatory framework for the control and operation of all small public service vehicles and their drivers. In exercising its functions the commission will seek to promote the provision and maintenance of quality services by all small public service vehicle operators, primarily through the promotion of a qualitative and customer orientated licensing system.The commission will seek to encourage and promote competition in relation to services offered by small public service vehicles and will provide assistance, including financial aid, to local authorities to provide for the development or provision of infrastructure to support the operations of such vehicles.The policy focus of the commission will be to provide for the grant, renewal and, where appropriate, refusal of a licence to operate a taxi, hackney or limousine or to drive such vehicles; to regulate the conduct of drivers and passengers in small public service vehicles; to declare and alter taximeter areas; to fix maximum fares; to create a comprehensive national register of all taxi, hackney and limousine licences and their drivers; to suspend or revoke licences where appropriate; to appoint authorised persons who will have a role in relation to ensuring compliance with the terms of the licences granted by the commission and to enforce the regulations the commission makes. At present, the Garda or local authorities carry out many of the roles envisaged for the commission. The Bill provides that these roles will continue to be provided by those authorities and allows them to be delivered directly by the commission by agreement at a later stage.Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Commission for Taxi Regulation. In recent years, the Government has established a number of commissions or regulatory boards for the purpose of carrying out specific functions or the delivery of specialist services. Deputies will note that many of the provisions in this Bill relating to the engagement and structure of the commission, replicate the approach adopted in respect of other commissions and boards. Accordingly, in discussing this Part, I will limit my comments to issues of particular note and importance.It is my intention to proceed with arrangements for making a single appointment of the first commissioner for taxi regulation as soon as possible. This person will be vested with all of the powers and responsibility of the commission. The question of the appointment of further members of the commission will be considered if it is subsequently deemed necessary. It will be important from the outset that the independence of the commission is clearly established and accepted, especially by those who provide taxi, hackney and limousine services and the users of those services. This independence is clearly established through section 8.Section 9 establishes the principal function and objectives of the commission. The emphasis of section 9 is on issues relating directly to quality of service. The key objectives provide for the development of efficient and professional services to ensure a safe operating environment for both service providers and users. While section 10 allows the Minister for Transport to issue policy directions to the commission, it is envisaged that such directions will be focused on the better delivery of the central role of the commission, which focuses on quality of service. Notice and details of any such ministerial directions must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and published in Iris Oifigiúil.I now turn to those provisions which form the key central elements to this Bill, as set out in Part 3. This Part establishes a completely new framework for the regulatory control of taxis, hackneys, limousines and their drivers. The main features of this framework are: the future regulation of the control and operation of all small public service vehicles and their drivers; the introduction of mandatory automatic disqualification for holding or applying for licences for those convicted of one of a range of serious offences; the engagement of new enforcement personnel who will augment the activities of the Garda; the introduction of tax clearance requirements for the grant and renewal of all licences; the adoption of a formidable system of penalties which may be imposed by the courts on conviction for offences under the Bill; the introduction of a system of fixed charges that may be paid in lieu of an offence going to court; and the application of a certification scheme for services that support the operation of small public service vehicles.There are many varied services that currently support small public service vehicle operations. These include the provision of communication supports and the design or provision of signs or other equipment. Section 34 provides a new legislative basis for the regulation of the licensing, operation and ownership of small public service vehicles and the licensing of the drivers of such vehicles. The House will note that the focus on standards is highlighted at the very outset of this section. In an enabling provision of this nature, it is inevitable that many specific issues are referred to. For the sake of brevity, I will summarise the overall section as follows.It vests very broad powers in the Commission for Taxi Regulation and places that office at the centre of the future development of the services provided by small public service vehicles. It provides for the future regulation of all small public service vehicles and their drivers. It emphasises quality standards as being the central focus for the future operation of small public service vehicles. It allows the commission to determine the bodies, including itself, which will have a role in the licensing of small public service vehicles and their drivers. There is a clear focus on quality. In addition, the section clearly establishes the framework through which the commission can develop separate licensing structures, standards and duties for each of the various categories of vehicles that provide the various hire services.Similarly, separate licensing requirements and standards can be applied to the drivers of these vehicles. That focus is also highlighted by the fact that the section gives a strong message on the needs of passengers, especially in the context of the information that must be made available to them and the training of drivers to meet the needs of passengers. Given the significant growth in the industry in recent years, particularly through the increased supply of taxis, the need to promote and address customer awareness training and general quality service issues by the providers has come to the fore. Furthermore, in highlighting the issue of vehicle and operation standards, the section refers specifically to the possible introduction of provisions on matters such as the age of a vehicle to be licensed as a small public service vehicle and standards on entry to the vehicle and accommodation for people with a disability, including wheelchair users or persons with mobility and sensory difficulties.The provisions in section 34 will be augmented by granting additional powers to the commission to regulate the conduct and duties of drivers under section 39. This section places a further premium on the quality of service and the need for drivers to address the reasonable needs of passengers. It is equally important that the behaviour of passengers in small public service vehicles should be subject to a degree of regulation in the interest of public safety. These are provided for in section 40, which establishes obligations and rules for both passengers and intending passengers relating to general behaviour and payment of fares. Section 34 also sets out a key role for the advisory council, which must be consulted in respect of any regulatory proposals the commission wishes to pursue in relation to the licensing of small public service vehicle drivers. This is in addition to the later provision in the Bill, through which the council can give advice on any regulatory proposal being pursued by the commission.Section 35 provides for an appeals structure against a decision taken under section 34 to refuse a licence or to revoke or suspend an existing licence. In addition to an appeal to the District Court, a person who is the subject of such a decision will be afforded a period of 14 days to make representations to the licensing authority in question to review the matter before the initial decision is taken.Section 36 marks a very significant advance in seeking to provide greater reassurance to the travelling public that those who are engaged in the provision of taxi, hackney and limousine services are persons that can be trusted and in whose care passengers feel safe. The section provides that where a person has been convicted of one of a range of serious offences across a broad spectrum of law, they will face automatic disqualification from holding any licence relating to such services. The offences include murder, manslaughter, assault, rape and offences involving drugs and firearms. Within very strict parameters, people disqualified as a result of convictions for those offences may make application to the courts to be allowed to apply for new licences. Such applications cannot be made until specified periods have passed following any conviction. In the case of the more serious offences, the period can be a minimum of ten years. No such application can be made where a person is serving a prison sentence.In addition to those disqualifications which apply in respect of all licences, a person who has been convicted of one of a range of very serious traffic offences will be disqualified automatically from obtaining a licence to drive a small public service vehicle. Such disqualifications will last for five years where the conviction was for dangerous driving causing death or serious injury, or two years for offences of driving under the influence of drink or drugs. The House may note, in particular, that where a person who is the subject of a disqualification under this section attempts to engage in any activity relating to small public service vehicle services, they will be faced, on conviction on indictment of that offence, with a potential fine of up to £50,000 and a jail sentence of up to three years.Section 37 introduces a requirement that licences may only be granted where an applicant presents a tax clearance certificate. This will ensure that all of those engaged in this industry are fully tax compliant. The Bill will also facilitate the transfer to the commission of a number of functions that are related to the licensing and operation of taxis in particular. These functions focus on the key issues of determination of taximeter areas and the fixing of maximum fares for taxis. Local authorities will retain the power to determine the location of appointed stands or taxi ranks and the making of relevant by-laws for this purpose, subject to any guidelines issued in this regard by the commission. This reflects the more general role of local authorities in the overall management of traffic in their areas.The Bill involves the introduction of fundamental changes to the framework for penalising offences relating to the services provided by small public service vehicles and their drivers. Section 44 provides that the maximum fines for the commission of offences will generally range from between €1,500 to €3,000. In certain circumstances, prison terms may be imposed for repeat offences. Section 46 provides for a scheme of fixed charges for offences under the Bill. The commission is being empowered to apply such charges to whatever offences it deems appropriate. This will offer those accused of offences to which the fixed charge system is applied, the opportunity to pay a charge in lieu of having their case brought to court.To complete creation of a comprehensive range of initiatives targeted at enforcement, section 49 provides for the appointment of authorised persons. That concept will automatically include members of the Garda Síochána. This section additionally empowers the Commission for Taxi Regulation to appoint others as authorised persons. These persons will be given broad enforcement powers so that the standards that the commission will apply to the operation of small public service vehicles will be enforced and maintained.Part 4 presents the legislative framework for the establishment and membership of the Advisory Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation. The role of the council and its relationship with the commission and the Minister for Transport are clearly defined.Section 53 provides that the Minister for Transport will appoint the council, which will consist of up to 15 members in addition to a chairperson. Appointments will be for a period of not more than three years and will be made from persons from a broad range of areas, which have a relevance to the operation of small public service vehicles and to the delivery of their services. Against that background, membership of the council will include at least four members to represent the interests of those who provide small public service vehicles. Taxi, hackney and limousine operators provide services to communities throughout the country and it is important that they should have a voice and a role in a body which this Bill will place at the centre of the future of the services they provide. Other members will include representatives of consumer interests, representatives of persons with disabilities, business and tourism interests.Section 54 gives the council a central role in examining proposals for statutory initiatives by the Commission for Taxi Regulation and providing advice and comment on those and other proposals that the commission may wish to pursue. The council may also provide advice to the Minister for Transport on overall policy on legislative matters affecting small public service vehicles. In keeping with the need to maintain and to provide confirmation of the independence of the commission, the council's role relates exclusively to that of giving advice and it cannot dictate policy to the commission.This Bill marks the delivery by the Government on a key commitment set out in the programme for Government. Even the most cursory examination of the laws applying to taxis, hackneys and limousines would confirm its complexity. This Bill offers a new approach that will replace more than 40 years of regulations that have become unwieldy and difficult for those who work in this service and users to follow or understand.Taxis, hackneys and limousines operate throughout the country and wherever they are encountered, the public have a right to expect that they can depend on those services for the delivery of an efficient and a safe response to their transport needs. Aspirants to obtain licences to operate and drive small public service vehicles as well as existing licence holders should expect that they must be required to achieve and maintain very high standards. In this way they can rightly feel they are part of a quality orientated service of which they, the public and the State can be proud.This Bill presents the legislation necessary to deliver on the expectations of the public and the aspirations of the industry. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on this historic legislation, and I commend it to the House.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I welcome this Bill, which will replace the old system of licensing and regulation involving the Garda Síochána and the carriage office with a new statutory agency called the Commission for Taxi Regulation. I welcome this long overdue legislation which, given the way deregulation took place, will benefit members of the industry and the public alike.There is no doubt that over the decades the situation in the taxi industry had become anomalous. Regulation by the Government and local authorities prevented the smooth development of the service in line with demand, as the EU Parliament Committee on Petitions found. However, the Government's deregulation of the taxi industry has led to what can be only described as a devastating impact on the lives of some families. As the EU Parliament committee noted, the decision to appoint an interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation with no statutory powers was proof that the Government had second thoughts as a result of the effects of its poorly planned actions three years ago.It is my hope and the hope of the Fine Gael Party that this Bill will address the concerns of those within the industry and of the public at large. As the House is no doubt aware, the Government engaged in November 2000 in an instant overnight deregulation of the industry minus – what would surely have been prudent and a necessary – an impact study to ascertain how such drastic action would affect those who had invested heavily to buy into the Government's regulated industry and minus consultation and with what appears to have been little consideration for the full implications of their actions on licence holders, their families and the wider public. Without doubt, deregulation should have been gradually phased in over a period.Since the Government engaged in this ill-planned and poorly considered action it has failed the taxi industry in many regards. It has failed to monitor and oversee a market that was once regulated and failed to implement reasonable policy change when it was necessary. It failed also to act in a timely and appropriate manner in response to widespread anxiety at the negative effects of its policy on the industry.As a result of deregulation, the number of licences increased from 2,722 in November 2000 to more than 6,500 in July 2001 in Dublin alone. As the group, FAIR, Families Advocate Immediate Redress, have repeatedly brought to the attention of the Department of Transport, entrants to the industry had paid an average of €107,000 for a taxi licence. These families still have 17 years of a 20-year term loan to repay this debt. Further, and as a result of the Government's action, those same licences are now worth less than €6,500 and, in some cases, a great deal less. I stress this is not only a problem that affects Dublin. Taxi drivers nationwide were also badly affected by the overnight deregulation.I know of two cases in Ennis where prices in excess of €150,000 were paid for taxi licences, some of the highest amounts paid in the country, and following overnight deregulation, these individuals were caught unaware and are left holding what is now a comparatively worthless asset with huge long-term loan repayments. There are more than 90 taxi plates in Ennis and more than 100 hackneys. They provide a valuable service, particularly for young people who do not drink and drive and use the services of the hackneys and taxis on weekend nights to get home safely. This has reduced the number of deaths on our roads. Ennis still has no provision for additional parking spaces or pick up points, and I am sure a similar problem exists in most towns and cities.With regard to the high prices paid for licences, I welcome the statement by the Minister that he is putting in place some specific arrangement to implement the findings of the Taxi Hardship Panel and to deal with claims arising from the deregulation of the industry. However, I draw the Minister's attention to the belief by FAIR and others that the Taxi Hardship Panel could not adequately address the issue it was set up to address. The panel has been accused of lacking clear terms of reference, suffering from conflict of interests and working on a simplistic categorisation system. FAIR believes the awards the panel recommends does not alleviate the hardship of families of entrants to the industry who have suffered as a result of Government policy. THE EU Parliament committee found that the Government has a moral and political responsibility to provide proper redress to families which bears some clear relation to the amount of their financial loss. I urge the Minister to bear this in mind when implementing the findings of the Taxi Hardship Panel via this legislation and to continue his discussions with FAIR. I am aware that he had discussions with its representatives last week.There is no doubt this legislation is long overdue. Like the farmers before them who brought the tractorcade to the streets of Dublin, taxi drivers were forced to take to the streets on 11 June last. It was protest by taxi drivers in November last that prompted the Minister's promise to act urgently and introduce an interim national taxi regulator. In the context of further disruption on the streets of Dublin, I am happy the Minister has finally brought forward legislation that should address their demands.Paramount in this regard is the appointment of national taxi regulator as chairperson of the independent Commission for Taxi Regulation under section 6. This is particularly welcome given the deterioration in many aspects of this industry which to date has been overseen by a regulator lacking statutory powers.However, this welcome is muted due to the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, that the new statutory regulator will not be established on a permanent basis until the autumn or perhaps later in the year. This delay will no doubt further infuriate members of the industry and the public in light of the negative consequences of the Government's actions three years ago. The concerns of the public must be a priority. People must feel safe when hailing taxis at night.For years this country, particularly its capital city, has been subjected to a hugely inefficient, expensive and infrequent taxi service. Although the waiting times for taxis have declined as the number of licence holders has risen from 3,000 to more than 10,000 in less than three years, the number of complaints about the taxi service seems to have increased to an even greater extent. There were 540 complaints in 2001 and 207 so far this year. Complaints have increased considerably in recent years. Consumers have complained about the condition of vehicles – dirty, run-down cars. Abusive and inconsiderate drivers are the subject of 17% of complaints. There is also a suspicion of widespread overcharging. I have experienced this myself – when travelling to Heuston Station or Dublin Airport in off-peak periods with few traffic delays, fares can vary considerably. About 40% of complaints are about overcharging and the new regulator must address this. There have even been a number of cases of assault. It was reported widely in the media last year that the carriage office revoked the licences of 11 drivers.It has been obvious to most people for some time, and it is now finally obvious to the Government, that statutory regulation of the taxi industry is urgently required. I hope that under the functions and objectives of the new independent commission to be set up under section 9, the new regulator will have the power to enforce regulations and withdraw licences if necessary. It is of paramount importance that measures such as a minimum level of training and knowledge of one's town or city and effective background checks and character checks of applicants for licences are put in place. I am sure the Minister shares in the sense of shock that greeted the claim of the National Taxi Drivers Union that one in seven of the people granted licences since deregulation has a criminal record. I will deal with this later when I come to section 36.The effectiveness of this new legislation and the commission for which it provides will rest on its ability to tackle the real and perceived worries of all who are employed in or employ this service. To this end, I would welcome, for example, the provision of a 24-hour freefone service to report complaints, the number of which should be clearly visible and advertised inside taxis; the compulsory displaying of taxi ID numbers inside a taxi, both front and rear; the introduction of a central taxi monitoring and booking system and the introduction of a practical multiple pick-up or taxi-sharing system. It is also desirable that under section 9(2) of the Bill, the acceptable standard for small public service vehicles is outlined and maintained. Overall, I urge the Minister to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are utilised in the most appropriate manner so that the actions I have outlined, which will inject confidence into the industry, are introduced as soon as possible.Section 18 deals with the staffing of the commission, which is to be determined in agreement with the Department of Finance. I have some concerns about whether the commission will be fully resourced and staffed. The Minister may recall the 2003 budget last December, in which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, agreed cuts in the public service sector and a reduction of 5,000 in the number of public servants over the next three years. Because of this, a definite commitment should be given regarding the level of resources to be allocated to the commission.Section 36 is a key provision of the Bill. It is the section from which members of the public will draw confidence in the new system of regulation. I would go as far as to say that it is this section by which the success of the Bill will be judged. In this section, the Government proposes to allow convicted criminals to apply for a licence. Either it is acceptable for criminals to drive taxis or it is not. This section is flawed and must be amended. According to the present proposals, existing taxi drivers with criminal convictions – assault, car theft or causing death by dangerous driving – can still be holders of taxi licences. Section 36(1)(c)(ii)(II) is a good illustration of the nonsensical nature of aspects of this legalisation. The implication here is that a person who has committed an assault upon a passenger will be disqualified from holding a licence, but if the driver has committed the very same offence in any place outside his or her vehicle he or she is eligible to hold a licence. Section 40 deals with the regulation of passengers. Under this section, a passenger must comply with any reasonable request made to him by the licence holder. However, this is already covered under existing legislation, such as the Public Order Act 1994.I remind the Minister of his own description of the current situation in the taxi industry as a "jungle-type operation". There is and has been for some time an urgent need to introduce order to this so-called jungle. As a means of doing so, I welcome this Bill. While there is no doubt that the situation in the taxi industry had become untenable, the Government's overnight deregulation of the taxi industry led to often devastating outcomes for the families of licence holders. On top of this, the faith of the public in the taxi service, based on their own experiences, information from the Garda Síochána and coverage in the media, has been lost. Most of all, the description of some taxis and drivers as presenting "a danger to the public" surely signifies that this legislation is long overdue. It is very welcome.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill before us. The commission that will be appointed following the enactment of the Bill will be charged with the establishment of a high-quality taxi, hackney and limousine service on a national basis. It is warmly welcomed and must be commended, but it is not before its time. The Government's appointment of an interim taxi regulator was a small step in the right direction, but it was worthless without the necessary statutory regulations. A taxi regulator will only be effective if it has the powers to enforce the law and withdraw licences. That includes providing the resources to ensure that the commission can enforce the legislation we are to enact.The current situation is intolerable. Taxi licences are granted to almost anyone who applies, regardless of his or her knowledge of the geography of the area. Having a criminal record does not present an obstacle to obtaining a licence. Many of the current rules governing insurance and tax clearance are being flouted, with few consequences. The issue of insurance has been ignored to date. The Minister is addressing this issue in the legislation in relation to tax clearance certificates and this is to be welcomed. To give an example, one person was driving a hackney for two years without adequate insurance to cover the work he was doing or the passengers in the vehicle. For two whole years he drove a seven-seat vehicle with no insurance. If there had been an accident, the State would have had to pick up the tab.It is vital that applicants meet certain standards in relation to minimum training requirements, knowledge of routes and background checks before a licence is granted, if we are to have a service that people can trust. Prior to deregulation, the gardaí vetted new entrants in the industry, but since deregulation they have had to deal with a greater number of applicants. On at least one occasion the decision not to grant a licence has been overturned by the courts. The taxi service is now out of control and some taxi drivers represent a real danger to the travelling public. The Irish Times reported that there had been 129 attacks on members of the public travelling in taxis over a two-year period, including one involving the man at the centre of the X case, who was jailed for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 15 year old girl. There is an urgent need for greater control over the issuing of public service vehicle licences, in consultation with the Garda.Garda records show that complaints about taxis have increased over recent years. In 2001 there were 509 complaints and in 2000 there was only half that number, 220. In 2002 the number rose to 540 and so far this year there have been 217 complaints. Some 17% of complaints relate to abusive manners by taxi drivers, 1% relate to sexual assault and 50% relate to overcharging. There have been a number of incidents involving taxi drivers and drugs. Since deregulation in 2001, six new taxi drivers have been implicated in major drugs deals. There have been incidents of taxi drivers having gangland connections. There is a huge problem within the system at the moment and I hope the Taxi Regulation Bill will ensure we can weed this aspect out of the system.I am disappointed by the Government's response to date because it has dragged its heels in introducing this form of regulation. As late as 22 May this year, I questioned the Tánaiste on the Order of Business as to when the legislation would be introduced because the main thoroughfare in this country, O'Connell Street, has become a no-go area. People, particularly women on their own, are afraid to walk down the street in case they are assaulted and are afraid to get into taxis because of the lack of standards. The Chief Whip's response was to stop taking taxis. That was her response to solving the problem. I am pleased the Minister has expedited the legislation.Criminal convictions are one element but knowledge of the city is another. This has probably partly to do with the overcharging which is taking place. I heard of an incident where a driver travelling from Ringsend to Ranelagh wanted to go through the city centre because it was the only way he knew. In another instance recently, a person got a taxi from the city centre and the taxi followed the bus to Rathmines because the taxi driver did not know how to get to Rathmines. The person in question would have been better off using the services of Bus Átha Cliath rather than getting a taxi. This is a crazy system which has broken down.The big question is whether deregulation has worked. People must still wait for up to two hours for a taxi, particularly after midnight and at the weekends. The answer to the above question is a resounding "No" because we still have not got the level of service we need. There is no compulsion on anyone to work a night shift which many drivers view as both anti-social and extremely dangerous. This is tied inextricably to the existing fares structure where there is little enticement to work anti-social hours. There is not currently an effective enticement in place and we must address this issue. We must ensure there is a 24-hour service, through a dual tariff system, so that we will have taxis when we need them.Some taxi drivers claim they work in excess of 70 hours per week, which is in blatant breach of health and safety legislation. No one wants to get into a taxi if the driver has already driven for 60 or 70 hours that week. Another problem which is becoming apparent as deregulation takes effect is that many taxis are now being driven by part-time drivers who are holding down a full-time job. Many of these taxis make an appearance only at the busy and lucrative weekend period. This is in direct breach of safe working practice and is actually illegal in many instances. There is no compulsion on anyone to work a full week but procedures must be put in place to ensure a driver can prove that he or she will not breach the regulations. Consideration should be given to ensuring that a plate holder works a minimum number of hours per week. In my own county, where we have hackney licences as opposed to taxi licences, prior to deregulation an applicant would have had to prove they could provide 40 hours service per week or they would not be issued with a hackney licence. This gave some type of assurance that the vehicle was available for hire throughout the week, not just at lucrative times. While this is an extremely difficult measure to police, it should be considered by the commission.I will now turn to the various strands of the Bill. Section 9 sets out the principal functions of the commission. Will the Minister ensure that these powers will include, as Deputy Breen said, a 24-hour freephone line for complaints in order that they can be easily made? Complaints can only be made if identification is clearly visible both inside and outside the vehicle. This is not the case at the moment. I have travelled in taxis in recent weeks where many of the identification cards on the dashboard were virtually invisible. No identification was displayed on the back of the vehicle.The commission should look at a centralised taxi monitoring and booking system. For example, if I pick up the telephone to call a taxi company, I do not know whether the company has nine or 90 vehicles. Naturally, based on the number of vehicles they have, the chances of their responding to the call would be completely different. A company may have vehicles lying idle around the corner, yet another company will have to bring in a vehicle from another part of the city. The system can only be co-ordinated on a centralised basis and the commission would have a role to play in this regard.Section 11 permits the commission to provide financial assistance to local authorities to develop taxi services from the fees collected. Deputy Breen raised an important point on the parking and other facilities available since deregulation. I hope some of these resources will be used for that purpose. Will the Minister outline the value of the fees collected since deregulation and say what has happened to them? It is estimated that the value of such fees could be as much as €60 million. I would like the Minister to clarify where that money has gone.Under section 25, the chairman of the commission must appear before the Dáil committees. I hope I will not allow the Minister to abdicate his responsibility to answer parliamentary questions in this House. Each week in this House legislation is introduced which enacts particular measures. However, the Minister backs away from answering parliamentary questions. It will get to the stage where this House will be a glorified talking shop and no one will be accountable. We will get a reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office that the Minister has no official responsibility to the House on a matter. I look forward to tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the position in order that we will have accountability to this House, and all organisations funded through it and the Department of Finance.Sections 33 to 51, inclusive, in Part 3 and sections 52 to 54, inclusive, will only commence on ministerial order. When will these sections be enacted? It is imperative that they are enacted swiftly to ensure the regulator is appointed as soon as possible. Deputy Pat Breen asked if the regulator will be in place on a permanent basis by the autumn. At what stage in the autumn will the regulator be in place? Does autumn mean August or 31 October? It is a pretty broad definition.Section 36 deals with the disqualification of drivers. What will happen if a current licence holder has a previous conviction? Will the licence be withdrawn? From now on, anyone who has a conviction will not be able to apply for a licence and, after one has served his or her sentence, he or she will not be able to apply for a licence for a number of years in some instances, depending on the offence. What will happen to people who are already in the system who do not know the difference between the north side and south side of Dublin, who do not know how to get from the city centre to Rathmines or have to go through the city centre to get from Ringsend to Ranelagh? Will these people be weeded out of the system or will they have to pass a test to prove they are capable and competent to meet the required standards? There is no point introducing legislation to deal with what happens from now on for new applicants coming into the system. We need to try to weed out the people who got through the system since deregulation. I would like the Minister to clarify that matter because it is the single biggest question mark over the legislation. It is an issue which must be clarified before the legislation is passed.Section 53 provides for the establishment of an advisory council, to which 15 people will be appointed and I understand they will be appointed by the Minister. I want a categorical guarantee that these will not be sinecures on behalf of the Government and that those appointed will be capable, competent and prepared to do the job. The Minister for Public Enterprise in the previous Administration, Senator O'Rourke, set down specific details in the legislation as to the type of qualification required by each member appointed to a board. Regardless of the political persuasion, it is imperative they have a level of competency and it is not a sinecure for someone who failed to become chair of some county council. I would like clarification on that.Deputy Pat Breen spoke about the meeting with FAIR on 16 June, on which the Minister also commented. I am sorry to hear that meeting ended in an impasse. I understand the Minister has decided to meet again in the next few days when both sides have considered their respective positions. Members of FAIR requested that the Minister meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. After a certain amount of persistence the Minister has finally agreed to have a chat with that committee. This seems to be contrary to the commitment the Minister gave to the European Parliament petitions committee, which was over here.The report of that committee requested that the Minister make a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on his proposals. The petitions committee clearly stated the Government has a moral and political responsibility to provide redress. In his speech, the Minister spoke about cases of extreme financial hardship where individuals would be entitled to compensation of up to   €15,000. However some of these people would have been paying the Revenue Commissioners considerably in excess of that in probate and capital gains tax.Up to the time of deregulation the Department of Finance considered it an asset. However, subsequent to deregulation, it is not being considered as an asset by the Department of Transport. The Minister should consider this issue seriously and address it. We do not have to call it compensation, but he should introduce realistic payments. Some people are in severe financial difficulty and those cases must be addressed.The legislation defines responsibilities on passengers in taxis as well as on those in the industry and it is important that this is given recognition.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I warmly welcome this comprehensive Bill. Given that it was only circulated yesterday, to the extent that I have had the opportunity to consider the Bill, it seems to deal with all the main areas of concern in respect of the taxi industry. My one complaint is that it is two and a half years late. During this time a jungle has been created that has largely been of the Government's making following its ill-judged and rash decision to deregulate overnight without giving consideration to the implications of that decision on quality control, safety and hardship. Given where the taxi industry is at present, this Bill represents an attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. There is quite a mess that has to be sorted and it is unfortunate that these issues were not considered before the overnight deregulation carried out by the then Minister, Mr. Bobby Molloy.It is also regrettable that it has taken a number of demonstrations by taxi drivers and efforts by Opposition spokespersons to get some action in this area. We had been promised this legislation much earlier and it is now being rushed through in the dying days of the current Dáil year. I will not hold it up in any way but it is important we have an adequate opportunity to scrutinise the legislation. It has been difficult for us to do that overnight, particularly as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport met from 9.30 this morning and we are not particularly well read in the provisions of the Bill.While we very much support the passage of this legislation as early as possible to allow the Minister to approve the appointment of the first commissioner during the summer so that the new office can be in place in the autumn, I am somewhat concerned to see the schedule proposed for next week whereby it is intended that the Committee, Report and Final Stages of the Bill be taken within a two-hour period in a committee of the whole House next Thursday. That is not very satisfactory if we are to give any kind of scrutiny to the Bill and allow even a minimum of time to consider the amendments that will be tabled. I ask the Minister to reconsider that. We have allowed two days for Second Stage this week and to only allow two hours next Thursday for Subsequent Stages does not facilitate Members in performing their duty in scrutinising legislation.Very serious problems were created by the decision of the last Government to deregulate overnight. Those problems arose because the lid was lifted from the taxi licensing system completely. It was done without notice and was a complete departure from what was the established policy and procedure up to the point of deregulation. It is important to consider what had happened throughout the 1990s particularly in the Dublin area where there was an unanswerable case for the provision of additional taxi licences.The economy was growing very rapidly in that decade and we are all very familiar with the problems people had getting a taxi particularly at night time when there were queues for up to three hours. The number of taxis available was completely inadequate. The number remained inadequate throughout the 1990s principally because of the actions of some of the Minister's colleagues, who led the campaign to restrict the number of licences in the Dublin area.I am talking about people like the Ministers of State, Deputies Noel Ahern and Callely, and Deputy Martin Brady, who gave cast iron guarantees to some interests in the taxi industry that under no circumstances would there be any additional licences issued throughout most of the 1990s. They led those involved in the taxi industry up the garden path for many years by giving those promises. In return they received many favours from certain sectors of the taxi industry. During the 1997 general election campaign, we all recall umpteen taxis on the north side of Dublin with advertisements stating "Vote Ivor Callely". I note that the commission will take responsibility for advertising and I hope when the commission draws up its regulations it will ensure there will be no political advertising on the taxis.That is how the system operated in the late 1990s. There was a clear understanding between certain sections of the taxi industry and several Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors in the Dublin area who refused point blank to take any account of the economic reality in the country at the time. They refused point blank to take heed of the public demand for additional taxis, giving false promises and being complicit in bringing about a situation that was unsustainable. In the late 1990s, this all led to an explosion of public anger in attitudes to the taxi industry.The Minister will recall the late 1990s when finally there was agreement reached to bring all the players together in the taxi forum. Agreement was reached on the number of plates that would be issued and what was the right way forward for the industry. There was clear agreement that an additional 500 plates were to be issued each year. That was the new taxi scenario at that stage. It is on the basis that people took decisions on buying and selling plates and deciding whether to enter the industry that people feel aggrieved.An agreed way forward with a regulatory system provided for additional places and that an agreed process be followed. I spoke recently to a person who applied for a taxi licence under this arrangement – the points system – and failed as they did not have an adequate number of points. They received a letter from Dublin Corporation at the time saying that, unfortunately, the application was not successful this year, but that the corporation intended to issue another 500 licenses the following year and a further 500 the year after that. It was made clear by the licensing authority that this was how the industry would operate over the coming years.On that basis, the person I spoke to went out and paid £80,000 for a licence, only to find a few months later that there was overnight deregulation. That person has a good legal case – such cases will be tested in the courts over the coming months – on the grounds of natural justice, that this was the system in operation, laid out clearly by the authorities concerned and was the basis for taking a commercial decision to buy a licence. The State has a responsibility to those persons when there is such an overnight reversal of policy and complete change in the commercial viability of licences.My other concern with the implications of overnight deregulation is in respect of the service now available to the public. There is a complete absence of quality control. It is said that there were no clear controls before deregulation. However, there were controls that operated behind the scenes by virtue of the fact that in forking out £80,000 for a licence, a taxi driver had a certain standing. It was a huge investment and such investors were unlikely to take risks in terms of behaviour and crossing the line to criminal behaviour. To that extent, there were certain guarantees for passengers in respect of safety.Now, the situation is different where there is open market, where virtually anyone can enter without the "entrance fee" and, therefore, there is not the same guarantee in respect to safety. For that reason, there has been a substantial increase in the number of attacks and incidents. Increasingly, members of the public, particularly those travelling on their own, are nervous about taking a taxi at night-time because there is no guarantee that a reputable person is driving it.The other neglected area is the whole question of the quality of driver-customer standards or vehicles. There are no standards for the type of vehicles that can be used. I recently saw a Volkswagen Polo with taxi top lights. It is crazy that a car the size of a Polo can be used as a taxi because there is no limitation on size. There is no quality control, with many old, smelly, untidy cars, with drivers who do not care whether their customers are satisfied. There are many complaints about overcharging and thuggish behaviour on the drivers' part, with no attention given to customer care. The attitude is customers can take it or leave it. If one needs to travel from the city centre to the suburbs at 2 o'clock in the morning, one is at a serious disadvantage, with little or no choice. All these areas need to be urgently regulated. My hope is that this legislation will provide for that, but my regret is that it has taken two and a half years for it to be produced.Much financial hardship has been caused by deregulation. The FAIR group met the Joint Committee on Transport and we have met other taxi interests in the past couple of weeks. There is no question but that genuine, severe, personal hardship is being experienced by a significant number of taxi drivers. I have met many of them and their wives at my clinics, as will have many other Deputies. There is no question that there are families under severe stress because of overnight deregulation. Taxi drivers' wives have spoken to me in detail about the difficulties they are experiencing due enormous pressure on family finances, personal relationships and their children.These were the people who, on the basis of the way the Government agreed to proceed with the taxi industry prior to deregulation in October 2000, invested to a significant extent in buying a licence. These are the people who now find it difficult to make a living out of the business, working long hours. They find it impossible to make the repayments on loans on top of that. These are the people who bought at the height of the market in the months preceding deregulation, taking out mortgages of up to €100,000. They are now faced with payments in excess of €900 per month. I am sure the Minister for Transport will accept that it just does not add up in the current economic climate – making a living for a family and then making those repayments. Whatever about the legal responsibility, there is no question the Minister has a political and moral responsibility to deal with that issue. Taxi drivers, their businesses and their families are going to the wall, and action must be taken to urgently deal with this.There is the other category of elderly people and widows who are dependent on income from a taxi plate, often their only one in many cases. Those people find themselves at a complete loss. An asset that would have generated an income of €200 to €250 per week is wiped out overnight. There is no proposal of any consequence from the hardship panel to deal with those real personal hardship cases. We were dissatisfied with the recent meeting we had with members of the taxi hardship panel. It was clear that its approach was not to identify and quantify the level of hardship suffered by taxi families, but rather to work out a system of divvying out a fixed amount of money. That was the approach they took but when questioned by members of the committee they were unable to stand up their recommendation, which is disappointing.It is also disappointing that the Minister has completely ignored the report from the EU Petitions Committee, which took this matter very seriously. The committee's members came over here to examine the matter and went through the various cases put to them. Their report recommended that the Minister should meet the Committee on Transport to come up with a revised schedule of hardship payments. The Minister has indicated in committee and here in the House, however, that he has no intention of paying any heed to that report. At a time when we would expect the Government to be interested in the institutions of the European Parliament, it is a poor performance by the Minister to rubbish the report of the Petitions Committee. I understand when he met representatives of FAIR, the Minister rubbished them as he rubbished members of the Committee on Transport, saying that we were only playing politics. A reputable committee of the European Parliament has made clear and strong recommendations, yet the Minister is just walking away from them. That is not acceptable.Much effort was put into the campaign by members of FAIR, who have handled the situation very well. They were responsible and did not take to the streets; they pursued the issue, made their case and were very pleased with the findings of the Petitions Committee. They may have been naive but they hoped the Minister would heed such a report. It turns out, however, that in spite of the commitments the Minister gave to members of the Petitions Committee when they met him in Dublin, he will just ignore the report.Limited as the payments from the hardship panel are, I ask the Minister to ensure that they will be made as quickly as possible because people are in serious financial difficulties at the moment. They need immediate relief, so I would ask the Minister to make those payments on an interim basis. They are inadequate but initial payments should be made, after which the Minister should review any further payments. I do not see why it is necessary for a statutory commissioner to be appointed before that process starts. The Minister has been kicking to touch in recent months by saying he is waiting for the commissioner to be appointed, while at the same time delaying that appointment. Why can the payments not be made straight away? Why does the Minister have to wait until the person is in office?The appointment of the commissioner or commissioners falls to the Minister on a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commission, and that is as it should be. I was somewhat surprised, therefore, to read in the newspaper about a certain high profile public servant whose name was being floated in respect of this position. I certainly hope there is no basis to that report, on the grounds that it should be an open and transparent procedure with no question of people being identified at this stage, thereby bypassing the selection procedure. I trust that procedure will be open and that the rumours concerning a particular person did not emanate from the Department.Having read the Bill, the complaints procedure is not clear to me. I have tried to establish the number of complaints made since deregulation but it is very hard to do so. I have received limited figures from the carriage office but it has been brought to my attention recently that the complaints procedure that is supposed to be in place does not operate. Two phone numbers are advertised for passengers to call to make complaints about drivers' behaviour. The other afternoon I tried both numbers at least ten times each but neither phone was answered. That was in mid-afternoon so I am sure the Minister will accept that is not a very satisfactory situation. When I questioned the gardaí responsible in the carriage office they said they had a number of lines there and received hundreds of calls every day dealing with all aspects, including PSV licences and so on. Clearly, there should be a dedicated line that is staffed 24 hours a day and if it is busy, calls should be diverted to an answering machine. At the moment neither phone number is connected to an answering machine. The statistics are not reliable if there is not a proper procedure in place for making complaints.On the point raised by Deputy Naughten concerning the commission's accountability, I note that the commissioners will be obliged to come before Dáil committees, as is only right and proper, but I am concerned that they will not be answerable to the Dáil through the Minister who will not be required to answer questions on their behalf. I have already brought to the Minister's attention how unsatisfactory that is because he is keeping at arm's length various bodies that have been established under his Department's aegis. When we ask the Minister about critical issues of policy or operation he says he is not answerable to the Dáil for whatever organisation it might be. Some time ago, the Minister said he accepted our difficulties and he took on the responsibility for getting answers to questions concerning those bodies. That worked for a few weeks but I notice that recently when difficult questions have been asked about any bodies within the ambit of his Department, he has reverted to saying that he is not answerable to the Dáil for them. That is not very satisfactory, however, so perhaps the Minister could re-examine that matter in respect of his replies to parliamentary questions. I expect that the Minister should be answerable for the commissioners in the House.What is the role of the carriage office in respect of issuing PSV licences because local authorities are responsible for granting taxi licences and there seems to be little connection between the two? As things currently operate, I can buy a taxi plate, although I do not have a PSV licence, and I could give it to a third party who may have a PSV licence. That situation is unsatisfactory. If we are tightening up on the licensing procedure, as we ought to, there should be a direct connection between granting a taxi licence and holding a PSV licence. I would like to see that loophole closed.What records will be kept by the commissioners? I would like an assurance from the Minister that, while the commissioners are tasked with keeping records – and I welcome the introduction of that system – the proper computer back-up will be available at an early stage. Not only should all the players – including the carriage office, the commission, local authorities and the Garda Síochána – have access to the records but, given the experience with the penalty points system, the Minister needs to take steps at an early stage so that whatever kind of computer back-up is required it will be in place when it is needed, at the start. I hope the Minister will assure us that that kind of forward planning is taking place.I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby applicants for taxi licences will be required to produce a tax clearance certificate, which is only right.Wheelchair accessibility has been the greatest failing in respect of the taxi industry. At the time of deregulation, and prior to that, we were promised that people with physical disabilities would be catered for. Given the difficulties with public transport generally, it is critically important that taxis are wheelchair accessible. In the late 1990s, some progress was made in that regard but many of the people to whom additional plates were issued for wheelchair accessible taxis have left the business because of the high cost of running people-carrier vehicles. Those vehicles have been sold on for private use and the current number of wheelchair accessible taxis is lower than it was before deregulation.Those cars that we talk about as being wheelchair accessible, principally people carriers, are not wheelchair accessible in the strict meaning of the word. There is space in the car, but there are huge difficulties with access in terms of ramps. There are very few ramps and many of those that are in existence do not cater for the more modern type of wheelchair. I hope the commissioners will give early attention to that area. We need to regulate clearly and set down very clear specifications in terms of the number of wheelchair accessible taxis and what constitutes being wheelchair accessible. I look forward to that being done.The Bill provides for the transfer of funding from the commissioners to local authorities. In this regard, what has happened in Dublin in respect of facilities for taxis is a disgrace. There has been a very big increase in the number of taxis but there are now fewer places at taxi ranks than there were prior to deregulation. That needs to be stipulated very clearly by the commissioners. Funding will also be necessary because there are certain expenses involved in providing ranks. It is ludicrous that the rank previously provided on O'Connell Street opposite Clery's has been relocated due to ongoing works to Prince's Street, where cars are queued with no indication that there is a rank there. It is not a taxi rank but a waiting area. It is very unsatisfactory, and the same applies to many areas throughout the city centre and the suburbs.The commissioners need to address as a matter of urgency the intolerable situation in respect of taxis at Dublin Airport in terms of the practices that are engaged in and the closed shop being operated there. I recently came across somebody from the Whitehall area who, having got off a flight at Dublin Airport, sat into a taxi. On being informed that he was going only to Whitehall, the taxi driver subjected him to a string of abuse and refused to take him, using a number of expletives in the process. That kind of attitude needs to stop. The predatory approach taken by a number of taxi drivers at Dublin Airport, where a complete and utter closed shop operates, needs to be tackled. That is not acceptable either for Irish citizens or for visitors.I welcome the provisions in respect of the council that is to be established. I question the method of appointment of members. The Bill seems to suggest that it falls to the Minister to make those appointments. I ask that the recent practice that has come into play be adhered to whereby, while legally and technically the Minister will make the appointment, the person representing the different interests is selected from among those interests and nominees will be suggested to the Minister who, in turn, would appoint them.

I am very glad to speak on this Bill, which I support. People in Dublin have been very aware over the years of the lack of taxis, particularly when it was raining. People also felt the taxi service was expensive. There were taxi plates available but at a very high cost, but people did not have a very good service.The former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Robert Molloy, was very proactive in this regard and deregulated the trade, for which he was much criticised. However, the people of Dublin felt he had done them a good turn. The number of licences has trebled since deregulation occurred. That has brought its own problems but, on the bright side, it has allowed taxis to be available for the people of Dublin and the public whom we are here to serve as best we can, including people with children and disabled people. I agree that we should strive to have all our taxis disabled-friendly. Any help the Government can give in this area should be given and I strongly promote it.The former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Robert Molloy, who is no longer a Minister or a Member of the Dáil, did the people of Dublin a favour. I am aware, through the Safe Home programme, that he was also proactive in supporting older people in England who wished to return. In that regard, I spoke to him in the past about extending the capital assistance scheme, which he did.The increased number of taxis brought its own problems regarding the condition of the taxis and a drop in standards. There were also some very unfortunate incidents, including a rape case, as a result of which the person got a jail sentence.There is a very great need for some sort of regulation. It is not before time and is very much to the point in including taxi quotas and so on. It shows recognition of the urgent need for this as perceived by the taxi drivers. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward and strongly support it. The provision of a taxi regulator is very important in laying down standards to ensure the public has a service that is professional and of a high standard.The payment of compensation to taxi drivers is very necessary because they were discommoded, having paid a high price for plates before deregulation. There is a group of discommoded people in my area as well who are very much in need of some type of support or compensation. There are only 50 people in the group, 25 driftnet fishermen and 25 draftnet fishermen, who deserve support.It is wonderful that so many taxis are available in Dublin. In my area there is not even a proper public transport system. The Minister has been proactive in this regard with rural transport initiatives and so on, which I hope will increase. In my area we do not have the traffic or population problems of the east coast. If the focus was on developing the west and on balanced regional development, which really has not happened despite the existence of a national spatial strategy, many of the problems in Dublin could be addressed. About 50% of graduates from the west have to go to Dublin to get their first job, and these are all people who will require services such as taxis. If the Government met its commitment to balanced regional development, those people could stay in their own area. There is a great need for this because the west, and north-west Mayo in particular, has been designated as the most deprived area in Ireland and the area most in need of attention. There was a Shannon free tax scheme for that area which was very useful, and we need something like that in the west.What is happening is inequitable. Alarm bells are ringing because the population of the Dublin commuter area is increasing all the time. Traffic is already at ass and cart speed and will slow even further. There is therefore an urgent need to address the regional imbalance of increasing population in Dublin and decreasing population in the west. I urge the Government to address this issue. The establishment of the Commission for Taxi Regulation is necessary.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Under our legal system, the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences. The law enables the judge to exercise his or her discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he or she has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence and assessing the culpability and circumstances of the accused.The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 enables me, as Minister, to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary and, in this regard, funds are made available to the Judicial Studies Institute, which was established by the Chief Justice for the purposes of judicial training. It is understood that the issue of sentencing has been examined by the institute in the context of its training programme.As regards consistency in sentencing, the Deputy should be aware that section 36 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 makes provision for meetings of District Court judges to discuss, inter alia, the avoidance of undue divergence in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court and the general level of fines and penalties. While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other courts, it is understood they hold similar meetings.Under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence. The issue of extending the power to the DPP to appeal against lenient sentences in serious cases before the District Court has been referred by the Attorney General to the Law Reform Commission for consideration.The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in 1996 in a report that specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines. The report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in regard to some of the recommendation, which tends to underline the obvious complexities that arise in regard to sentencing policy.The Law Reform Commission recommended that non-statutory guidelines should be introduced to the effect that the severity of the sentence to be imposed on a person found guilty of an offence should be measured in proportion to the seriousness of the offending behaviour and that the seriousness of offending behaviour should be measured by reference to the harm caused or risked by the offender in committing the offence and the culpability of the offender in committing the offence.Additional InformationThe commission also recommended in this regard that the sentencer should not have regard to the deterrence of the offender or others from committing further crime, to the incapacitation of the offender from committing further crime or, where a sentence of imprisonment is warranted, to the rehabilitation of the offender when determining the severity of the sentence to be imposed.I generally concur with the Law Reform Commission's thinking behind its recommendation on statutory guidelines. In this regard, the point was made in the report that the more detailed the requirements of any statutory sentencing procedure, the more likely it was that mistakes would arise leaving sentences open to challenge on technical grounds only. As I have mentioned, the report pointed out a number of differences of opinion among members of the commission in relation to sentencing guidelines. A minority opinion dissented from the recommendation that the Government should introduce non-statutory guidelines and expressed the view that, while there is room for further identification and refinement of the criteria by which judicial discretion should be exercised, the task should continue to be entrusted to the Judiciary itself.This is a complex matter and expert opinion in the matter is divided. In approaching the issue, I am mindful that the role of the Court of Criminal Appeal will, inter alia, be examined by the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts, at present sitting under Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly's chairmanship. The work of the group is being carried out in modules. The first module concerns the criminal law. In this regard, I understand that the group has been examining the merits or otherwise of a mechanism of objective guidance for sentencing. The group is due to report very shortly and I have made it clear that I will carefully consider all the recommendations made by the group, including those in relation to sentencing policy.

His stance has changed on this when one considers his reply. I want to focus on one area. A three month minimum sentence should be handed down to drug offenders in the District Courts. The drugs trade is flourishing and gardaí are continually frustrated as drug dealers get the Probation Act or are fined. At the very least, a minimum sentence of three months needs to be applied to drug dealers. A message must be sent to drug dealers. Will the Minister respond?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I have not changed my mind. When I spoke on this subject, I referred to providing a statutory basis on sentencing and guidelines in that context and I have in mind what the Law Reform Commission recommended, which is maximum sentence guidelines. However, the Deputy's question referred to minimum sentence guidelines, of which I have never spoken in favour as they would be problematic.Apropos the Deputy's remarks on drug dealing offences, for any offence of drug dealing to be dealt with in the District Court a decision is required of the DPP that it is a minor matter. I do not know about the case to which the Deputy refers but, by definition, it is required, first, that the DPP considers it to be a minor matter and then a District Court judge, exercising a separate, independent judgment on the matter, must also confirm it is a minor matter. If a serious offence for drug dealing was dealt with in the District Court and it ended up in the way described by the Deputy, it could only happen on the basis that the DPP and the judge had independently arrived at the view that the particular episode of dealing amounted to a minor offence.I am not the DPP, and I must stress that on every occasion I appear in the House. I do not attempt to criticise or usurp his functions. However, dealing in serious drugs, on the face of it, is something society would not regard as a minor offence and only in exceptional cases could dealing in drugs be dealt with at District Court level. Dealing in drugs with a commercial value is the subject of a minimum sentence in the Circuit Court on indictment and, in those circumstances, I do not know how the events outlined by the Deputy could have come about and caused frustration for the Garda because I imagine in all those cases the prosecuting gardaí would have made a recommendation to the DPP as to whether in their view the matter was fit to be tried as a minor offence.

When one examines the different District Court areas, there are massive inconsistencies. The Garda has pointed this out time and again. To get rid of that inconsistency, the Minister will have to introduce a minimum sentence of at least three months for those who are convicted of drug dealing in the District Court. He is almost inferring that drug dealing and drug abuse are minor matters, which they are not. Those practices are flourishing and are absolutely rampant. The problem has grown since the Minister came to office and he has not addressed this issue.

I said I could only imagine that drug dealing would be dealt with in the District Court as a minor matter in exceptional circumstances because most people would regarding it as a major matter.

The Deputy is alleging there is a huge disparity in sentencing policy among members of the District Court and that some members are allowing drug dealers off on the basis of the Probation Act. This is news to me. I have never heard of this and it has never been suggested to me that that is the case. However, if it is the case, I re-emphasise it can only be that the DPP decided the matter was fit to be tried summarily because it was a minor matter and a District Court judge came to the same conclusion. There is nothing I can do in those circumstances.I will take an example from the lower end of the spectrum such as somebody who supplied an ecstasy tablet to two others for money in a club. Unless that is what is in prospect, I cannot imagine a circumstance in which a District Court judge would apply the Probation Act to a drug dealer. It has never been suggested to me that this is a problem and the Garda has never reported that that is a problem.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	349	As the Deputy notes, the national advisory committee on drugs (NACD) recently published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland. The estimate is based on statistics provided by three data sources for 2001: the central drug treatment list; the hospital in-patient enquiry database; and the national Garda study on opiate misuse and related criminal activity.This is the first formal estimate of opiate users undertaken since a 1996 study which used the same methodology but estimated prevalence for Dublin only. It is worth noting that the figures are estimates and that there is a marked decrease on the previously reported figure for opiate users in Dublin – 12,456 in 2001 compared with 13,461 in 1996. I accept that these figures are statistical and I cannot vouch for their statistical accuracy. I can only say these are what are offered. The decrease in Dublin is encouraging, as is the finding that the numbers of users in the 15-24 year old bracket has reduced substantially, which may point to a lower rate of initiation into heroin misuse.The Government remains committed to working in partnership with communities most affected by drug misuse. The continued implementation of the actions set out in the National Drug Strategy 2001-2008 remains a priority. A key performance indicator in the strategy is to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by end of 2004 and by 50% by end 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. The Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise Service are achieving considerable success in relation to this target to date and they are to be congratulated for their continued efforts.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Despite the fact that the Minister is encouraged by the figures I have to say they are discouraging. The figures changed for the better between 1996 and 2001 but the figure for 2001 showed an increase on the previous year. The figure of 14,450 is not the ultimate figure. A higher figure of approximately 15,500 could be given. There are not grounds for complacency.Last month Independent Newspapers treated us to photographs of people shooting up in a public area in the city while gardaí, apparently, stood idly by. This brought home to the general public just how serious is the problem. At the same time the Merchant's Quay project, the largest supplier of services to drug addicts which operates on a voluntary basis, published figures to show it was under funded.There has been an increase this year over last year. Approximately 86% of drug abusers are in the Dublin area but it is not long since there was no opiate abuse in other parts of the country. It is obviously expanding throughout the country. There has been a reduction in the facilities provided under the various projects. Almost no projects are going ahead under the drugs task force and funding has dried up for the RAPID programme and the youth services and facilities fund.The Government does not appear to be serious about dealing with this problem. The number of drug addicts is estimated at between 14,000 and 15,000, with 86% in the city of Dublin. That is a huge number. Much crime is committed to feed the habits of these people.What does the Minister intend to do to improve treatment facilities and the alternative social inclusion facilities? Has the Garda any indication that it will reach its seizure target of 50%? How can it determine a target like that? How can one know where the other 50% is? There appears to be very little differentiation between Garda seizures of cannabis and of hard drugs. The vast majority of seizures are of soft drugs.

They are not percentages of the drugs coming into the country. They are increases in the volume of drugs seized. I cannot say how many drugs are in the country so I could not possibly say it is my target to find 50% of them. That would be a wholly unreliable way to approach things.There were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland in 2001 and there were 12,456 opiate users in Dublin in 2001. This was reported to be a reduction of 1,000 over the 1996 figures. I am not complacent about these things but one ray of hope is that the number of users in the Dublin area seems to be on the way down and a second ray of hope is that younger people are becoming less represented in the cohort of opiate users. This suggests that things are progressing in the right direction.The Deputy asked me what we are doing about this. Garda initiatives are along the following lines: conducting ongoing intelligence operations against criminal networks engaged in drug distribution; co-operating with other national law enforcement agencies in reducing the supply of illegal drugs into the State; undermining the structures and systems which support drug distribution networks through the concerted efforts of the Garda national support units, including the national drugs unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation; maintaining divisional and district drug units which are focused on addressing drug supply at a community level; and conducting pro-active operations such as "Cleanstreet" and "Nightcap" designed to address drug supply within communities.

Section 19 provides that a person who claims that prohibited conduct has been directed against him or her in any licensed premises may seek redress before the District Court. For this purpose, prohibited conduct is defined as discrimination against or sexual harassment or harassment of a person, contrary to Part II of the Equal Status Act 2000 on or at the point of entry to licensed premises.  The forms of redress currently available under the Equal Status Act are extended under section 19 to include temporary closure of the premises concerned and, for the first time, to give explicit authority to the District Court to revoke the licence of a public house which engages in discriminatory behaviour in breach of its legal obligations. Provision is also made for the Equality Authority to apply to the District Court for redress in certain cases, while subsection (7) provides that the authority provide assistance to persons applying to the courts for redress.I emphasise that the proposed transfer of jurisdiction from the Equality Tribunal (ODEI) to the District Court is based on a view that licensees should in principle be answerable for all their actions to a body exercising a single jurisdiction. There is no sense in which the transfer of the jurisdiction is designed to reflect on the professionalism, integrity or propriety of the Equality Tribunal. Suggestions that it is so intended are not based in fact.

The fact remains that the Commission on Liquor Licensing, under the chairmanship of Gordon Holmes, did not provide for a measure such as this. I fail to see the link between combating alcohol abuse and stripping the Equality Tribunal of its jurisdiction in hearing cases of discrimination that take place in licensed premises. I find it difficult to accept the Minister taking away powers from the Equality Tribunal. In the District Court there is no room for mediation and for investigation of the facts in a case. Would the Minister accept that it is pushing people into an adversarial forum, whereas the Equality Tribunal could listen clearly to the evidence of both sides without the onus of a court? Will he state whether he is aware of the widespread disquiet that over a dozen groups have queried the reason for taking away power from the Equality Tribunal and will he accept that it undermines both the Equality Tribunal and the Equality Authority in the application of their powers? Why was this included when it was not sought in the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing? It seems to have come out of the blue. Did it come from lobbying from publicans or from where did it come?No doubt those who are discriminated against are a very vulnerable group in the first instance. Whether they are members of the Traveller community or young people, they find it very difficult to access the District Courts, both in the physical sense because they are not physically accessible and also because they find it difficult to get the resources to engage in a court process. I ask the Minister, once again, to state the link between combating alcohol abuse and stripping the Equality Tribunal of its jurisdiction in this regard.

A number of options were put to me and I chose that particular one.Whereas the Deputy mentions that up to 12 groups have expressed dissatisfaction, I am of the view that the great majority of people support me in the choice I have made. In difficult and stressful circumstances a publican is faced with a choice as to whether to admit somebody, knowing that one tribunal, the District Court, may in the fullness of time hold him or her accountable for the decision made in admitting the person and punish him or her for letting the person in, whereas another tribunal may seek to make a compensation against him or her for making the opposite decision and refusing admission. The great majority of people believe that one tribunal should decide this issue, one way or the other, and that one tribunal should exercise discipline over licensees in respect of their admission policies. It has been suggested consistently that in some sense the Equality Acts are being disapplied from this issue, but that is not so. They still apply in toto.It has been consistently ignored that this is a measure which actually strengthens the remedies available because a District Court judge can now close a premises which, for instance, refused a gay or lesbian person admission in a discriminatory fashion. If there were a continued pattern of behaviour along those lines, the licence of that pub could be revoked.The Equality Authority can assist any person who wants to bring a claim for compensation in the District Court or to object to a licence in the District Court, and can effectively act as amicus curiae for that person in those circumstances. It is a fair, reasonable, balanced solution to a real problem and I am quite happy that the great majority of people agree with me on this issue.

Ranks up to and including inspector must retire at 57 years of age. A retirement age of 60 applies to ranks above that level, with some exceptions providing for retirement at 65. The Commission on Public Service Pensions has recommended, among other things, that members up to the rank of inspector should have the option of being retained to a maximum age of 60 rather than 57, subject to meeting minimum health and fitness standards.My objective is to have a fit, active and experienced force with an appropriate balance as regards age profile and experience, and I have considered the retirement ages applicable to the Garda Síochána with this aim in mind.At the Garda Representative Association's 25th anniversary annual conference in Galway, I indicated that I am prepared to sit down with them and see whether we can negotiate a new regime whereby members of the Garda Síochána could serve until the age of 60, and I will bring such proposals to the Government. That is the state of play at present. I intend in the near future, when the legislative load which is on me at present is off my shoulder, to approach the Garda representative associations to negotiate such a package.

#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I appreciate yesterday's response to that question. That is the right thing to do and it is necessary, but the problem is bigger than that, as the Minister understands. We are facing about 600 retirements this year in the Garda Síochána, which is a massive number.Last week it was disclosed that the Office of Public Works is spending €15 million on the refurbishment of the offices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in St. Stephen's Green. The Minister has, on a couple of occasions, stated publicly that he simply does not have the money for extra Garda recruits and I accept that within the Government he does not make the call as far as the building programme is concerned, but the public and the gardaí certainly do not understand that.One of the reasons the gardaí are retiring in such great numbers is that morale is very low. It is unacceptable in some of the stations around the country. When gardaí see that the Government is spending €15 million on the office in St. Stephen's Green, is it any wonder that they are retiring in these numbers? This must be a priority for the Government. The Minister can rationalise the fact that the offices need refurbishing, but he must pin-point and prioritise the real problem in the law and order area. The Garda does not have the necessary resources and manpower. The Minister cannot justify spending €15 million on the offices in St. Stephen's Green when gardaí from Kevin Street Garda station are telling me that the situation is hopeless on weekend nights, when there are three of them in the station and thousands of people on the streets, many of whom are committing public order offences.

Again I accept he does not make the call as far as money is concerned, but he is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a member of the Cabinet, and he must respond to the problem.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	366	As the Deputy will be aware, on the subject of retirement I agree with him that the rate of retirements from the Garda Síochána has been more than we anticipated, and that may have something to do with the fact that when gardaí, who exceed the age of 50, have 30 years' service, they know that in effect the guillotine comes down on a Garda career at the age of 57 and therefore they must start looking about fairly quickly, having crossed the eligibility threshold, for other employment to occupy the rest of their working life. It seems that one of the advantages of increasing the age to 60 is that people would say: "If I can work on to 60, I will not have to start looking around in my early 50s for an alternative occupation". There are other attractions to seeking to leave An Garda Síochána early which I want to examine. One of them is this: if they work, to use an old-fashioned colloquialism, if they retire early they will effectively have the right to a contributory pension which they can obtain under the social welfare code by the time they reach the age of 65. Those are factors which obviously feed into the decision to retire and when to retire. I accept the Deputy's point that it is a serious problem for me and one to which I must face up. At the moment I am running hard to stand still and to make progress up to the 12,200 in overall Garda numbers.The Deputy asked the question about the refurbishment of the office in St. Stephen's Green. A year ago, on the day I was appointed Minister, I was informed that very shortly thereafter the building would be evacuated because having been purchased for €25 million by the State some time prior to that, it was now proposed to re-vamp it. That has not happened yet and it may not happen for some time. I assure the Deputy that I am not in a position to command those resources, they are not available to me. The Office of Public Works, in its wisdom, may decide to expend them on maintenance of that building which is in a poor state of repair – the Deputy may come and visit it if he does not believe me—

I take the Deputy's point that the expansion of facilities at Templemore is one alternative matter for which the money could be used. If there is to be an expansion of Templemore there would need to be plans drawn up and tenders requested and public procurement, and the like. The two issues are simply not connected.

I was informed by the Garda authorities that two separate incidents occurred at Copper Alley, Temple Bar on 28 May, 2003. In the first incident at about 2.45 p.m., two Garda personnel responded to a call where they encountered three males who appeared to be injecting a substance. Details of the individuals' names and addresses were noted. They were searched but controlled substances were not found and they were directed to leave the area.In the second incident, at about 4.50 p.m. on the same day, two different Garda officers responded to a call to Copper Alley. On arrival, they saw two men in the process of what appeared to be injecting themselves. In this case also, details of names and addresses were obtained, both individuals were searched, again with no controlled substance being found, and they were directed to leave the area.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda response to both incidents was prompt. However, I am also informed that further action is available to the Garda and was called for in such circumstances such as conveying the individuals to a Garda station for the purpose of thorough search and the seizure of syringes for forensic examination. That was not done. Instructions have been issued on ways to deal with such situations in the future.In making these points I do not seek to minimise the hazards faced by gardaí in dealing with these situations. Neither however, do I wish to suggest that it is somehow acceptable or should be regarded as routine that the general public should have to witness drug abuse on our public streets. It is completely unacceptable and it is manifestly right that whatever action can be taken to prevent it should be taken, including the course of action I referred to earlier.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Will the Minister agree that many of these homeless, chronic heroin users probably became addicted at a very young age, at a time when the drugs problem was being grossly neglected and ignored by successive Governments? I trust and hope that it is not the intention now to scapegoat these victims of drug dealers because they appear in Temple Bar. The Minister's reply gives the impression that it is fine if it happens on the stairways of inner city flats complexes. It has been happening there for 20 years. Will the Minister agree that more appropriate action would be consideration being given to the provision of whatever services are required to ensure that these people do not continue to put their own health at risk and the health of the general public?I listened to the Minister on the "Rodney Rice" programme. He was about to endorse a medically supervised facility on the Swiss model when he abruptly missed his conversion and made a U-turn and then dismissed such schemes out of hand. There is expertise available. The Merchant's Quay project and other people are working on the ground with these chronic drug users. Now that after 20 years some members of Government and some members of the public have discovered the drugs crisis and come up with an appropriate way of providing—

It is a very serious problem. As I said in reply to Deputy Costello, the heroin problem is very serious. There are between 12,000 and 15,000 heroin users in Ireland.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	398	He was very persuasively suggesting to me that the State should provide rooms where heroin addicts could inject themselves with heroin. The appropriate response by the State must be to take a stance against heroin addiction, to use whatever methods, including methadone treatment centres, to guide people who are addicted – it is a terrible scourge to be addicted to heroin – away from that addiction and to help them. The notion that the State should become a heroin supplier or alternatively that the State should become the proprietor of premises where heroin is self-administered, is not an appropriate response. The Swiss example, to which the Deputy referred, shows that this is a cul de sac approach. It was eventually found that the establishment of public facilities where people are free to engage in such behaviour was a bad idea.We have to make clear our priorities across the board. I wish to make clear that the State cannot get into the business of supplying opiates to heroin addicts. That is a clear proposition. Methadone treatment should not be a long-term palliative as its aim must be to help to reform heroin addicts and to get them off the habit, rather than transferring their dependence from one drug to another. If heroin is legalised it will become much more available on a much wider basis. Even if it is supplied in certain controlled circumstances, there will be a black market, in effect, which will ensure that the problem will become ten times worse. I am about to launch a programme which considers our approach to this problem in places of detention and I will also attend a conference of prison governors on the issue. I am not at all happy with the approach taken by the State to the use of opiates in prisons.

My door is always open to people, including to the Deputy, who wishes to discuss ideas. I do not envisage that a decision will be taken to provide a programme of State-subsidised or State-sponsored heroin administration to heroin addicts. As I said earlier, the State must attempt to help people to break the habit and it must provide a substitute in the form of methadone. I remain to be persuaded that the approach I favour is wrong.

It regards the result of the deliberations as a substantial starting point for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference later this year. Deputy Ó Snodaigh was present at the Forum on Europe this morning and heard me elaborate at considerable length on the Government's attitude. The convention has managed to produce a draft constitutional treaty which is written in a clearer and more legible style and is a considerable improvement on the existing type of texts with which we are confronted. It is necessary to outline briefly the decision-making system in the area of justice and home affairs, in order to place the proposed changes in context.I ask Deputies who are interested in my contribution at this morning's meeting of the Forum on Europe to access the record of that institution. A number of outstanding justice and home affairs issues need to be addressed. The State has consistently been opposed to the proposed European public prosecutor. Another issue worthy of consideration is the proposal to introduce qualified majority voting in respect of criminal procedure. A third issue that should be examined is the scope of the right to impose definitions of certain forms of offences and minimum punishments, at EU level, by qualified majority voting. The subjects I have mentioned are the three major areas of concern relating to justice and home affairs.As I said to the Forum on Europe this morning, I am content with the outcome in many other areas, such as the collapsing of the three-pillar legal framework system into a one-pillar structure, the introduction of uniform legislative instruments for the European Union and the extension of QMV to asylum, immigration and other issues. I have outlined my attitude to the state of play in relation to justice and home affairs matters arising from the report of the convention.

The draft constitution dramatically increases the competence of the EU in the field of criminal law. This is demonstrated by the final report of the convention's working group on freedom, security and justice, which stated that "there are a number of areas such as cross-border crime, asylum policy or control of the Union's external borders which cannot be dealt with effectively by States acting on their own, nor is defence against the new terrorism threats compatible with autonomous action at national level". The report also stated that "policy should be rooted in a shared commitment to freedom based on human rights, democratic institutions and rule of law."  The practical reality of the proposals for integration and harmonisation is that we will most likely see a shift in the balance of rights from individuals and accused persons to prosecution authorities.Does the Minister think that the EU constitutional provisions in the area of justice and home affairs will lead to a levelling up of rights, as some people hope, or will it lead to a levelling down of rights, as many people fear? Will the new EU constitution lead to an erosion of the rights enjoyed by Irish citizens under the Constitution? Will the rules regarding admissibility of evidence, for example, be affected? Will the European Court of Justice be effective in enforcing the rights of Irish citizens in the field of criminal law against EU institutions? Is the Minister concerned by the executive's dominance in this area, especially in view of the democratic deficit identified in the Laeken declaration and the overriding need for democratic legitimacy in the field of criminal law?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Having attended this morning's meeting of the Forum on Europe, the Deputy will appreciate that I have addressed at length the concerns he has raised. Time does not permit me to repeat a tiny fraction of what I said this morning.I take the Deputy's point that if QMV is extended to all aspects of criminal law procedure, if the definition of the area of EU competence to harmonise laws by QMV is put in place and if the EU public prosecutor is left in place, it could be argued that the EU is becoming the origin of considerable competence in criminal law. This is a concern of the Government. As I said at this morning's meeting of the Forum on Europe, we have to ask ourselves what protective mechanisms would exist in such circumstances to guarantee the rights of citizens.The Government has tabled amendments to the Convention report. The Convention process is coming to an end and, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen said, the question of justice and home affairs is something which will be finally looked at and finally resolved, we hope, in the context of the intergovernmental Council meeting in the autumn which may also stretch into our Presidency. In that context the Deputy can remain assured that the Government, and my Department in particular, will remain vigilant to ensure that the constitutional rights of Irish citizens will not be endangered by any developments with which we are unhappy.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	427	In regard to the area of freedom, would the Minister agree that there is now a golden opportunity to bring in a travel document, perhaps even an adapted driving licence, to allow Irish citizens travel throughout the European Union without a passport? Does he not agree that it is unsatisfactory for Norwegians and others to have access to the European Union on a lesser document while we still have to produce a passport?Will the Minister consult his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Transport, to see if some lesser document than a passport could be devised which would not be an identity card for internal use but could be used for travel within the European Union?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I heard Deputy Mitchell make a similar proposal today at the Forum for Europe. I will confer with my Cabinet colleagues who have competence in this area and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is the lead Minister in respect of passport policy, in regard to whether it is possible for Irish citizens to be given more user-friendly travel documentation which would suffice within the context of the European Union. This is not a matter free from all complication, however, because, as the Deputy is aware, this is an aspect of the Schengen acquis to which Ireland and the United Kingdom have not yet acceded. I do not know whether our fellow members states of the EU would be happy to see us dine further á la carte at that table and give ourselves additional privileges in respect of travel documentation without undertaking some of the other more onerous aspects of Schengen. This is clearly a matter on which we would have to consult with the United Kingdom as it would have implications for the common travel area which, in Border regions in particular, is a matter of acute sensitivity here.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The Refugee Appeals Tribunal is an independent body established under the Refugee Act 1996. The tribunal comprises a Chairperson and, at the present time, 31 ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The criteria used in making appointments to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are set out in the Second Schedule to the 1996 Act. Ordinary members of the tribunal who are part-time, hold office for a term of three years and, as in the case of the Chairperson, are required to have had not less than five years' experience as a practising barrister or practising solicitor before appointment.The Chairperson is appointed following a competition held by the Civil Service Commission for a term of office of five years. While the post of Chairperson was advertised before it was filled by the present incumbent in 2000, there is no statutory requirement to advertise the position of ordinary member.The tribunal has, and continues to play, a vital part in the Government's overall asylum strategy with a huge volume of appeals processed and dealt with in a timely, fair and effective manner in line with our international obligations. The tribunal is always ready for inspection by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' representative in Ireland. The momentum achieved in the tribunal's affairs is being maintained and the earnings of individual tribunal members are a reflection of the volume and throughput of cases essential to maintain that progress and a fair asylum process.The existing arrangements are working well and there are no plans to review procedures for appointing ordinary members of the tribunal.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Considering what the Minister said, it would certainly seem that it is high time that we reviewed the tribunal. Is the Minister aware that €3 million was spent in the past two and a half years on wages to the 31 ordinary members and that the sums of money each received varied from €319,000 to one member, more than €200,000 to three members, while two members did not receive anything.Do we not need to review the procedure to see why there is such an imbalance of cases handed out to individual members? The members are barristers, solicitors and in some cases, former politicians and Ministers. We are now informed that there are no statutory criteria for advertising for ordinary members. Surely we should review the legislation when there is a large amount of funding from the public purse being distributed in what appears to be a most unequal way.Will the Minister review the situation, given that the payments are per case not per diem? The more cases an individual is given, the more the payment will be. Surely we have learned the lesson from the tribunals that if one pays on a unit basis it will amount to a huge sum of money at the end of the day. It is simply not good enough to allow a body to operate in a manner which seems to be neither transparent nor accountable. Vast sums of money are distributed yet we have no criteria for the establishment of members.Will the Minister review the situation with a view to introducing some amendment to the legislation, in terms of advertising for members and the manner of payment?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The Department of Finance sanctioned the appointment of up to 32 members of the tribunal. They are paid on a per item basis precisely because that is the best way to ensure that this important work is done effectively. The taxpayer might inquire of me as to why a change is required to the basis of payment to such as per diem, per week or per annum which would result in members getting a fixed stipend regardless of how much work is done.The system is working well and I am content with it in its present form. The term of appointment of many of the current members will fall to be reviewed in November of this year. There are reasons why the two people to whom the Deputy referred received zero payment. It is nothing to do with them not being allowed to work or whatever.

I do not want to find out what personal or private matters might be involved. Why appoint two members and then not give them any cases to deal with?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	435	That is not the case. One person was appointed comparatively recently and the other person, for some personal reason of which I am unaware, was unavailable to do the work at the relevant period.Out of 32 people I cannot ensure that everybody is available at all times. I assure the House, however, that there is no question of the chairperson of the tribunal denying any member access to a caseload. It is quite the reverse. I have spoken to the chairperson of the tribunal and he assured me his aim is to ensure that everybody participates to the maximum extent that their personal circumstances permit them to do. I want to get that point across as clearly as I can.The system is working well and if it is not broken we should not start fixing it. If the Deputy wishes to put down amending subsections, he may do so, subject to the rules of the House. I cannot predict what the Chair will say. There will be an opportunity in the context of the refugee and asylum Bill which will be before the House again. The Deputy is well capable of putting down amendments and has probably decided already what amendments he wishes to table.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I suggest to the Deputy that we leave the question until then.

However, it is an important issue. We are discussing an appeals mechanism in relation to the tribunal for people applying for asylum. Interestingly, the ratio of success is much greater on appeals than on first applications. It is important to have a certain degree of transparency in this process so that we know what is happening. It seems strange that one person should have a huge number of cases while another person might have none. I believe there should be some advertising criteria and that it should be advertised abroad. I hope the Minister will still consider that. Otherwise, I will have to introduce an amendment.

This said, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Síochána operates in accordance with strict guidelines in such matters and in accordance with law and their duty to uphold the constitutional rights of all persons.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank the Minister for his concise reply. There have been many recent allegations, apparently well founded, particularly in relation to British military intelligence activities in Northern Ireland over the last 30 years. In a very recent case in Inchicore, Dublin, a man was shot dead while wearing a flak jacket and carrying a gun. It was alleged that he was a Garda informer or agent and that crimes had been committed in relation to which the Garda turned a blind eye to protect its informer. Whatever about the guidelines which may exist, is there some form of accountability so that, where gardaí become involved in the murky world of dealing with ordinary criminal or paramilitary organisations, they do not overstep the mark and the law is not allowed to be infringed just because there is a desire to achieve good end results? How does the Garda ensure somebody who is "handling" an informer or agent does not, under any circumstances, allow them to break the law?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	440	There are, as far as I am aware, though I have obviously never read them, ethical guidelines as to how gardaí should deal with informers, informants and sources of information. That would have to be the case. However, I cannot elaborate, speculate or comment in any sense on the particular case to which the Deputy referred. I wish to make it very clear that An Garda Síochána, which is established under our Constitution and laws, must uphold the Constitution. There are no circumstances under which the Constitution, any perverse view of the interests of the State or law and order or whatever, would justify the servants of the State becoming involved in collusion or planning, authorising or sanctioning the commission of serious criminal offences for some ulterior motive. I am assured that is the case and I accept that it is.

In so far as the murky world to which Deputy Costello referred interfaces with the Garda in its normal duties in terms of trying to elicit relevant evidence, I assume some kind of network of informants and surveillance or whatever has to be used. Does the Minister wish to elaborate on that?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The short answer is "No". I do not wish to elaborate.

One of the grounds being adduced by the Minister in that Bill as to the reasons for release of prisoners on a temporary basis is to assist the Garda in its inquiries. There is a suggestion that those inquiries may not be simply in relation to the crime for which somebody is in prison, but rather other offences in relation to which that person might be of assistance. There must be a network in terms of dealing with people who are agents for the Garda and there must be some structures of accountability. It behoves the Minister to find out the position. The type of stories emanating from Northern Ireland are horrendous and there are similar though much less serious allegations in circulation in the public arena in this jurisdiction.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	446	While I did not wish to be short with Deputy Connaughton, I do not wish to go into this territory or speculate on matters of which I am not aware. However, I wish to emphasise that any police force in any society must have its sources of intelligence, but there is a clear line between having sources of intelligence and becoming party to the commission of serious criminal offences. To use Deputy Costello's phrase, it is not acceptable to turn a blind eye to the commission of serious offences involving serious injury to other persons or to allow criminal or subversive elements in our society to take or endanger life or endanger the constitutional rights of citizens. There is a clear line between those two situations and I am confident An Garda Síochána stays on the right side of it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The person concerned claimed asylum in the State on 27 March 2001, stating he was a Nigerian citizen. He failed to attend at the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for his asylum interview and became uncontactable. His asylum application was refused and on 21 August 2002 a deportation order was signed in respect of him. He failed to attend at the Garda National Immigration Bureau as requested to make arrangements for his removal and was thereafter classified as an evader.The person concerned subsequently made another asylum application in the United Kingdom under a different name and claimed to be a Ghanaian national. On 18 December 2002 the United Kingdom formally requested Ireland to accept his transfer back to Ireland under the Dublin Convention. The request was acceded to and he was returned to Dublin on 19 February 2003, where he was detained in Clover Hill Prison pending his removal from the State. On 3 April 2003 a Nigerian consular official attended at the offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau to interview him for the purposes of issuing a travel document. Prior to the interview, the person concerned informed the Garda that he was, in fact, a Ghanaian national and not Nigerian as he had claimed earlier. He gave a different name to Garda and signed a statement to that effect. He also gave details of his address in Ghana and indicated he wished to return there.The Ghanaian Embassy in London was contacted by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and, on being supplied with relevant information and a photograph, they issued a travel document to facilitate his removal to Ghana. The removal was commenced on 15 April 2003. Two members of the Garda National Immigration Bureau escorted him to Ghana via Amsterdam. On arrival in the capital, Accra, the person indicated to his escorts that he was in fact Liberian. He also informed the Ghanaian immigration officials of this, whereupon he was refused leave to enter Ghana, notwithstanding the presentation of the travel document issued by the Ghanaian Embassy in London. The Garda escorts requested that the Ghanaian Embassy in London be contacted but this facility was refused. The Garda escorts were left with no option but to take back the deportee on the return flight to Amsterdam and subsequently onward to Dublin. The GNIB believes the person to be the holder of a Ghanaian passport and efforts are continuing with the Ghanaian Embassy in London to have him accepted in Ghana.Figures are not yet available in respect of the Garda costs associated with the operation. However, the cost of the two air tickets is likely to be in the order of €6,100 when the bill is received. The person concerned deliberately misled the Garda and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner as to his true identity and nationality. I am determined that this should not succeed as it would send the wrong signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive and would create further difficulties for the Garda in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders.Every effort is made by the GNIB to ensure reception of deportees in destination countries. However, as the present case shows, this cannot always be guaranteed on arrival. The number of such cases where this type of situation arises is very limited. Where travel documents are required, the GNIB arranges for these with the particular embassy before removal is commenced. This sometimes means an interview of the deportee by a consular official before the documents are issued.I have thought of adding new criminal offences for misleading members of the Garda Síochána, but there is a school of thought that it is the right of refugee applicants to either mislead or deceive the organs of this State as to the circumstances of how they got to Ireland. It is frequently the case that all personal documentation is destroyed to facilitate the making of bogus claims. The Deputies will appreciate that it cannot be the case that the State backs down in the face of behaviour of this kind. As is clear from the facts of this case outlined to the House, every reasonable step was taken to ensure that this behaviour would not be rewarded, and it is my intention to ensure that it will not be rewarded.

This saga is a case of the Keystone cops. Gardaí brought the deportee to one country, found he was not a citizen of that country and then brought him here and put him in Mountjoy where he had to be promptly released by the governor, and he is living somewhere in Ireland. It seems incredible that we cannot determine whether the country of origin of this individual is Ghana or Liberia. What will happen when the Minister introduces new amendments to the Immigration Bill, he will deport many more people and the costs involved will escalate?I find it strange that the Minister could only tell me the price of the tickets which were astronomical. Two tickets cost—

If a person deliberately attempts to pervert the whole process by claiming to be a Nigerian national when he or she is not and throws away his or her documentation, it is very difficult to disprove that person's claim, especially when he or she melts into the background and never gets to the interview stage with the staff of the refugee applications commissioner. When this man was found and apprehended he had gone to Britain and commenced a second apparently fraudulent claim on foot of a different claim as to his nationality. He was sent back to Ireland, made a claim and arrangements were made with the Ghanaian Embassy for his return to Ghana.

There is great need for regulation of the taxi industry. There is not a person who is not concerned about travelling in the taxis that are available. There is concern about the general standard of taxis. Females travelling by themselves are concerned about the safety of travelling in taxis. There is a mistrust of taxi drivers, and that reflects badly on everybody in the industry. It reflects badly on the taxi men who provide a good service. This concern has arisen since deregulation, with all types of people becoming involved in the trade.There have been problems as regards the number of people involved in the industry and the way in which they have been allowed to become taxi drivers. There is a fear that the taxi system will be unsafe and that people will lose confidence in it. That is why I greatly welcome this Bill. A taxi regulator is needed to lay down the entry requirement for entrance to the industry. It will take away from the local authority and the Minister responsibility for issuing these licences and for laying down the conditions under which they can be given out. There is so much regulation that it behoves us to ensure the mechanisms are there so the scheme is seen to be working effectively. This will require proper monitoring.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I missed the Minister's speech because I had to sit in on a committee, but I was able to read it afterwards. In the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government some amendments to the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 were being discussed. In that Bill, powers are being taken away from the local authorities and we did the same a number of years ago with regard to taxi deregulation. The local authorities in the Dublin area were starting to come to grips with the system when deregulation was introduced. I welcomed deregulation and thought it was appropriate to open up the market and bring in freedom of entry and exit. I particularly welcomed the commitment, associated with deregulation, to provide universal wheelchair access among taxis. This important commitment was clearly outlined in all the Government's statements. It was promised that procedures would be put in place to ensure that by the end of 2003, the Government would start a process of ensuring all taxis were wheelchair accessible. It was understood this would take a couple of years, but the commitment was made. It was a Progressive Democrats commitment, since it was made by a Progressive Democrats Minister, but it was backed by both Government parties. The promise was clear.This is an example of how a promise from the Progressive Democrats or Fianna Fáil is not worth the paper the manifestos are printed on. It is disgraceful that although this taxi deregulation legislation is being introduced, that promise from two years ago has not been mentioned. There is no indication that the Government has any intention of living up to its commitment of ensuring that all taxis are wheelchair accessible. If I am wrong, I would like to hear that from the Minister. There is nothing in the Bill or in the speech the Minister gave today to indicate the Government intends to keep its promise. There is nothing in the answers I have received to questions to the Minister that indicates that it intends to meet this objective. It is a disgrace and a shame. I would like to hear the Government's excuse for this from the Ministers who blathered on last night, pointing the finger at other parties, when one simple promise, which would make a huge difference to the most disadvantaged in this community, cannot be carried through.There would be no huge financial burden on the State involved in carrying out this promise. It would be of huge benefit to the general public transport system, but the Government cannot do it.

I have read the Bill inside out and I have asked specific questions on this issue. All I get in response is that the Government is considering regulations to try to make taxi vehicles easier to enter for people of various mobilities. There is no mention, in the answers to the specific questions I have asked the Minister, of how the Government intends to carry out its promise.There are various ways in which we can look after those of impaired mobility in terms of taxis. We had a system under which a certain number of wheelchair-accessible licences were allocated. We all know that it did not work in this city. While some people did heroic work in meeting the needs of disabled people, many of the other plates were not used for wheelchair-accessible vehicles. It was almost impossible – and still is to this day – for someone in a wheelchair to order a taxi in Dublin. This is incredible at a time when the country is rightly celebrating the Special Olympics and seeking to be as inclusive as possible in the area of disability. It would be next to impossible for many of the foreign athletes who are here in wheelchairs to order a taxi in this city. Every wheelchair user in the city knows it is almost impossible to order a taxi unless one knows one of the few taxi drivers who do Trojan work in this area by living up to the commitment that was given.There are various ways of addressing this problem. The taxi unions feel that the Scandinavian model is the way to go. In Sweden there is a commitment to provide services for people with mobility difficulties, but the problem is that the system is hugely expensive and the service is totally inferior to that which any ordinary person could expect in terms of hailing a taxi. It is cheaper for wheelchair users, but it is incredibly expensive for the state. In Sweden and Finland trips for wheelchair users make up a massive proportion of the taxi business. In Sweden, they account for over half of all taxi trips. Those who are severely disabled in terms of mobility account for about a quarter of all trips. It is a major part of the market. I am not surprised that the taxi industry sees this as a good way to go, but the reality is that this system would not be suited to Irish conditions. I doubt the commitment of the Government to providing the finance that would be required to support such a system.We know that the model of providing a small percentage of wheelchair-accessible taxis does not work because we have tried it. What are the other options? We could adopt the system used in Belfast, which is not so different to Dublin, or London or any other city in the UK, where there is a commitment to 100% wheelchair accessibility for taxis. We had the same commitment in terms of the bus service, but that has also been rowed back on. Taxis are public transport vehicles. We either have a policy of access for the whole public transport system or we do not. It is the one crucial test for the Government which it has failed. One can read things into the Bill that are not expressly set out, but they were not in the Minister's speech, nor were they in the answers to my questions on this issue.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	485	That is because the issue is dealt with in the legislation.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	486	There are costs involved in moving towards 100% wheelchair accessibility. There is no doubt that the vehicles are more expensive. The report of a recent European survey on mobility estimates that the increased capital costs of depreciation could add up to something like 69% of running costs on an overall basis. We need to support taxi drivers in this business. We could take away VRT on taxis if they were wheelchair accessible – after all a taxi is a public service vehicle, not a car. It is expensive, but not that expensive. If it can be done throughout the UK, there is no reason we cannot do it here. There is a wide range of manufacturers who produce vehicles specifically designed for wheelchair access, not just in the UK but also in other European countries, so we would not be in breach of European competition rules. These vehicles are far superior to the converted vehicles we call wheelchair accessible, which are not designed specifically for this purpose and have significant problems in terms of access. There are also concerns about safety and manufacturing standards.What should we do? We should go for the best option which is designating a standard vehicle which is wheelchair accessible. Disgracefully, this was not mentioned in the Minister's speech as one of the policy objectives of the commission. The Government gave this commitment, but there was not a word about it in the Minister's speech. This system is better for drivers. There are almost 12,000 taxi plates in Dublin, four times the level of taxi ownership of the UK and an even higher ratio compared to other cities. Many of these drivers take out the family saloon on a Friday night, put up the sign and off they go as a taxi. Designating a standard vehicle which is wheelchair accessible would ensure a professional, full-time taxi fleet. A person could not throw a sign on top of their five-year-old family saloon and call themselves a taxi driver. There would be a proper vehicle which would be identifiable and easy to police in the bus lanes.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I am not saying there should be just one vehicle – I am talking about a vehicle that is 100% compliant with European standards in terms of wheelchair accessibility. There are eight or nine manufacturers across Europe who make these. I am talking about standards of wheelchair accessibility, not using a particular manufacturer. Other countries, such as the UK, do this and there is no reason we should not. It applies in Belfast and it could easily apply in Dublin. It might not have to apply in certain rural areas as those taxis might not be appropriate for large mileage, but it is certainly appropriate for a city, particularly Dublin.These vehicles have better safety standards. They protect the driver and the passenger. With the higher entry cost to the taxi fleet we could secure the incomes of those who are full-time, committed, professional taxi drivers. This is the right way to go – it is better than the present system under which anybody can get a plate and go out and earn money as a taxi without any real constraints in terms of the type of vehicle used, their knowledge of the city or the type of service they provide. There would be benefits for the disabled. People say the disabled make up a very small percentage of the market, which is true.The European survey on mobility I mentioned earlier, however, showed this small percentage of the population depends on taxis four and a half or five times more than the average person. It is a very important form of transport for certain people who have the right to call a taxi and not have to explain their special arrangement or expect they would be treated completely differently from everyone else. This has happened in relation to the bus service and it makes a huge difference, not just for these people but for a whole range of people who have mobility difficulties. When I travel on buses with my three or four children, it is a massive advantage to travel on a low access, wheelchair friendly vehicle. I can get on with the buggy and find space for it. The same applies to the quality of taxis which are wheelchair accessible. They carry more people, are purposely designed and are safer and better vehicles. When reviewing the process, there is no reason not to set out the correct standards. It is shameful that the Government has balked on this commitment.This facility is better for the general public because it is not just people with disabilities who prefer these vehicles. The general public prefer them because they provide a better service. If there is a demand for a saloon car service and so on that can be fulfilled by the hackney service, which will be quite extensive. People are not being told they cannot provide a service if they have a particular car, just not a taxi. They should not have the ability to pick up people on the street or travel in the bus lanes. Providing these facilities will guarantee someone a very good income as a taxi driver and guarantee the public a good service. The roll-out of the bus lanes will give a huge boost to the taxi industry in this city and, I hope, in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork.If there is a proper taxi service, using the bus lanes and being part of the public transport fleet, they will service all the people equally and will live up to the commitment the Government gave and, shamefully, despite what backbenchers might say, have now given up on. If I am wrong, I would like the Minister to say so and tell me how the Government intends by the end of this year to begin to provide 100% wheelchair accessibility. I hear a deafening silence. It is a disgrace this is happening at the time of the Special Olympics.

It is a pity it has taken 30 years and a failed Government experiment in deregulation to introduce legislation to establish such a body. It is also a pity that when the legislation comes before us we must deal with it in a hurry. Second Stage is being taken today and tomorrow and Committee and Report Stages will be taken next week. While I welcome the legislation, which should not be delayed, it is a pity it must be rushed through and that we do not have time to consult properly with the stake holders in the taxi industry, some of whom received copies of the Bill just last night.I welcome the Government's U-turn and the new-found urgency and realisation that deregulation has been a failure. It is a pity it took so long for this to hit home. It is also a pity the experiment had such an effect on the families of many of those who held taxi plates prior to deregulation. It caused the taxi unions to take repeated industrial action to try to get the Government to address their concerns.Deregulation has led to a massive increase in the supply of taxis, increasing by 377% between deregulation and the end of last year. The demand for taxis, however, has only increased by 5%. There is a significantly larger volume of taxis competing for only a slightly increased number of passengers. As a result, taxi drivers are being forced to work long hours, which has other implications for road safety. The cost of running a taxi has not decreased but has increased by 8%. The figures I am quoting do not do justice to the hardship suffered by taxi drivers and their families since deregulation. They have been pushed to the edge and forced to work long hours. A review carried out on behalf of the National Taxi Drivers' Union by Marketing and Strategic Management estimated that taxi fare revenue has fallen by 20% since deregulation. Many families have been driven to the wall by the Government's ill thought out deregulation policy.An American analyst who looked at the whole area of regulation of the taxi industry said that while deregulation produces a significant increase in the number of new entrants, it appears to cause declining operational efficiency and productivity, an increase in highway congestion, energy consumption and environmental pollution, a decline in driver income, a deterioration in service, and, paradoxically, an increase in passenger rates. This has been borne out in recent years in this State.Sinn Féin consistently opposed deregulation of the taxi industry and believes the Government made a big mistake in what we concede was a well-meaning effort to tackle the transport problems, particularly in Dublin. Better regulation was needed, not none at all, and the Bill before us is proof of that. The Government's deregulation of the industry destroyed overnight the investment of many families. It created the problem, in the first instance, by not ensuring there were sufficient taxi licences but it did not compensate those who invested huge money in taxi plates and lost it overnight. I urge the Government to tackle quickly the hardships endured by families and widows of taxi drivers who thought they had a pension fund in a taxi plate. I welcome the moves that are afoot to address this issue. I hope such action will not be taken by the Government in the future.The major element of this Bill is the setting up of a commission to regulate the taxi industry, which is long overdue. The powers being given to the commission in the Bill to establish certain requirements for people to obtain a licence, including being familiar with the city or the area, routes and place names, is to be welcomed. Some people entering the business at the moment appear to have very little knowledge of some of the major landmarks. Just last week a member of staff got a taxi in Finglas to come to Leinster House and the driver did not know where Kildare Street was or what Leinster House was. I sometimes wonder what is Leinster House.

It is a pity that taxi drivers are coming into the industry who do not know where certain landmarks are. I urge that a more extensive test be set to ensure we have taxi drivers of the highest quality. This country is renowned as a tourist destination and tourists should not have to get into taxis with drivers who do not know where they are going.

I am saying we must ensure there is a more extensive test than is currently the case. I am not criticising the Bill.I am concerned about section 49. While I support the need for people authorised by the commission to carry out investigations on its behalf, their powers are too wide under this section. As it stands, a person authorised by the commission can enter the premises of a taxi company at a reasonable time and carry out a search for documents and licences. This might benefit from some alteration so that the person concerned would have at the very least some verifiable grounds for suspicion before entering the premises. As it stands, an investigator for the commission has wider powers of search and seizure than the Garda.In relation to the advisory council set out in part 4 of the legislation the Minister should consider that with the list of other bodies and organisations which can nominate representatives and he might include people representing the interests of public transport in Ireland. This should include organisations like Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann whose activities directly impact on the taxi industry.Does the Minister believe there is a case to limit the number of terms that people can serve on the council, as will be the case with the commission. As it stands there does not seem to be a limit to the number of terms a person can serve on the council and perhaps the Minister will address that in his response.In section 53 of the legislation near the end of the Bill there is provision for a fine to be imposed on a person sitting on the council who violates the requirement of confidentiality. The person should not just be fined but also removed from the body for breach of confidentiality.I hope this Bill will result in an identifiable, clean, efficient and affordable taxi service, not only for Dublin where I live but also for the rest of the country. As the previous speaker said, the taxi service needs to be wheelchair accessible. In particular the taxi industry and the regulations should allow drivers and their families enjoy a reasonable income without having to work long hours which are detrimental to their health and to the health of people on the streets.

There is common consensus that this legislation is long overdue. It reflects a growing importance of the taxi industry to public transport here. The infrastructure of the country has come under enormous strain in the past ten years due to the huge increase in economic activity. This is most evident in the area of transportation infrastructure.Our airports, train service and especially our roads have been stretched beyond their originally intended capacities. The large increase in population and immigration as well as tourism means that every day more people want to go to more places more quickly. Every year more than 100,000 new cars come on the road, which has stretched the capacity of our roads beyond breaking point. For this reason every part of our public transport system must be modernised and stretched to maximum efficiency. The proper and orderly development of our taxi industry will play a major role in this.For many years most modern European countries have had a highly developed sense of the importance of their own taxi industry as an integral part of their transportation system. In New York the public see the taxi industry as being as important if not more important than its other public transport systems such as airports and the subway. I was fortunate to have been in New York recently and I saw at first hand the enormous contribution that a properly and well-regulated taxi industry can make to a city's economy. Most taxi drivers in New York view their industry as a profession and they carry out their duties with diligence and pride. It is highly regulated, highly organised and completely consumer driven. I used taxis four or five times a day when in New York and am firmly convinced that the new wide availability of taxi and cab services has contributed enormously to people's confidence in the use of taxis and I would welcome this sort of culture in our country.I make these preliminary remarks to illustrate the importance of the taxi industry worldwide and in this country. It is vital that the industry is properly regulated not only in the interest of the industry itself but also in the interest of the taxi using public.The principal purposes of the Bill are to provide for the establishment of the Commission for Taxi Regulation; to provide for a new code for the regulation of taxis with particular emphasis on the establishment of a qualitative and consumer orientated licensing system; and to establish the advisory council. The principal functions of the taxi regulator involve the licensing, control and operation of the taxis; the oversight of the development of professional safe and efficient taxis; setting the standards to be applied to vehicles and their drivers; promoting the development of high quality and cost effective services that meet a wide range of customer needs, including those of passengers; and encouraging and promoting competition in the services offered with particular emphasis on the protection of passengers and drivers.The whole thrust of these functions is to be consumer orientated. That is not to say that most taxi drivers are providing a bad service; the opposite is the case. I would like to put on the record of the House the high esteem in which Limerick taxi drivers are held. I do not underestimate the difficulties that have been caused by deregulation, but I firmly believe that, as with other types of deregulation, particularly in the areas of transportation, the new competitive environment will improve overall business significantly for the benefit of consumers, the taxi industry and drivers.Having said that, safety is of paramount concern to everybody. Many of us have heard of difficulties, which women have experienced in taxis and know of the well-publicised convictions in criminal cases recently. For this reason I welcome the provision prohibiting the issuing of licences to people who have specified convictions, particularly of a sexual nature. We want to encourage women to avail of taxis late at night after leaving nightclubs. We do not want them to walk home. This is a particular personal concern of mine.This concern has been addressed in the Bill which specifies that a conviction for any one of a range of serious crimes, including rape, murder, manslaughter, assault and drug trafficking, will disqualify a person from being granted a licence. A separate disqualification is included for drivers convicted of dangerous or drunken driving. These new measures are in addition to the facilities through which drivers' licences can be refused in cases where an applicant is not regarded as a fit and proper person, which is the system at the moment.I welcome the provisions in the Bill which offer increased protection to drivers. Passengers are prohibited from defacing or altering equipment and from spitting and deliberately soiling any part of the vehicle. I am concerned that this part of the legislation does not specifically deal with drunkenness in taxis. From my experience of talking to taxi drivers, I recognise their major difficulty with very drunk people getting into their taxis late at night. The Minister should consider having specific reference to that.The thrust of the legislation is consumer orientated. We need to have uniform standards of consumer satisfaction, particularly in the area of cleanliness of taxis. I emphasise that the vast majority of taxis in my constituency in Limerick are maintained to a very high standard. However as always it is the exception to the rule that damages the industry. The standards themselves are obviously very welcome in the new environment in which we all operate, but I call into question their enforceability. Clearly, the new regulations in relation to breaches of the criminal law are enforceable. I have doubts, however, as to whether the ability is there for the commission, the advisory council or the authorities to impose sanctions for drivers who are guilty of flagrant and continuous breaches of the new standards, as distinct from those relating to the criminal area.Following from this, the best enforcement method is to impose on the taxi industry a proper and identifiable complaints system which is available to the public as a whole. There are other measures in the Bill which are very welcome in relation to tax clearance certificates and to the money provided for local authorities in relation to the licences. The local authorities should use that money to provide customer shelters for consumers.Deputy Eamon Ryan made a lengthy contribution on the legislation dealing with wheelchair accessibility. I share his concern for the need for taxis to be wheelchair-friendly and wheelchair accessible. Last week, when a number of groups representing the disabled visited Leinster House to campaign on various issues, I saw outside the House a shameful disregard for the rights and sensitivities of wheelchair users. One of the campaigners leaving by Molesworth Street tried to get a taxi and was practically abused by a taxi driver – I hate to have to say this – for trying to get into the taxi.It is nevertheless not true for Deputy Ryan to suggest that the legislation ignores this issue. It does not and it is totally disingenuous for the Deputy to suggest otherwise. He suggested that he had read the legislation from start to finish, but I have my doubts. The fact that the issue was not referred to in the Minister's speech last night does not mean it is not in the legislation. If the Deputy eventually gets around to reading the Bill, I draw his attention to section 34, which imposes on the new commission obligations to make regulations in this regard. Subsection 2(f)(i) makes provision for the vehicle standards to be complied with, "including standards in relation to the entry to and accommodation in the vehicle for people with a disability, including wheelchair users or persons with mobility and sensory difficulties." I encourage Deputy Ryan to read that.I welcome the introduction of the Bill. The new commission and the new standards set out in the Bill will give rise to enhanced levels of service and consumer satisfaction. I look forward to discussing the Bill with my colleagues on the transport committee next week.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	501	This week's announcement by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, of the Taxi Regulation Bill 2003 is the most progressive development in the taxi business since the foundation of the State. When the Minister came into office he said he was going to deal with the jungle of the taxi business. He has delivered with this Bill, which will shed a light on that murky world.My personal experience of taxi, hackney and limousine drivers is good. The majority are decent, hardworking people. It is a pity that a few give a bad name to all.The Bill allows for the appointment of a national taxi regulator as chairperson of the Independent Commission for Taxi Regulation. The new commission will be charged with introducing a range of new structures and specific provisions that are aimed at the establishment of high quality services on a national basis by taxis, hackneys and limousines. The overall role of the commission will be to provide for full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient, safe and customer-friendly service by small public service vehicles and their drivers.The Bill also provides for the establishment of a national taxi council that will advise and make recommendations to the commission and the Minister in relation to regulations, standards and codes of practice for the taxi industry. Membership of the 16 member council will be drawn from the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda and consumer, disability, tourism and business interests. There will also be arrangements to implement the findings of the Taxi Hardship Panel. Under the arrangements, which will be announced shortly, claims for hardship arising from the liberalising of the taxi industry in November 2002 will be assessed and payments will be made to those who qualify.Under the Bill, the principal functions of the national taxi regulator will be the licensing, control and operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers; overseeing the development of a professional, safe, efficient and customer-friendly service; setting the standards to be applied both to vehicles and their drivers; establishing requirements in relation to the age, minimum size and capacity of vehicles; deployment of a range of qualitative standards which will have to be complied with by those seeking to be licensed as drivers, including a high standard of knowledge of the area in which they will operate; promoting the development of high quality cost effective services that meet a wide range of customer needs, including those of passengers with mobility or sensory impairments; the inspection of small public service vehicles; and setting out a dress code for drivers.The Bill will lead to the development of a professional, safe, efficient and customer-friendly service. Many people are concerned about their safety when they get into a cab. Concerns over safety standards for taxis have escalated following a number of violent incidents, including the alleged rape of three women last February. The safety of customers and vehicle drivers has become an issue of increasing concern. This concern is addressed in the Bill, which specifies that a conviction for any one of a range of serious offences, including rape, murder, manslaughter, assault, drug trafficking and a sexual offence will lead to automatic disqualification from being granted or holding a licence. A separate disqualification is included for drivers convicted of dangerous driving and driving under the influence of drink or drugs.The Bill also offers increased protection for the drivers of taxis, which is important. It is fair, right and proper that drivers are protected. Passengers are prohibited from defacing the vehicle, spitting or deliberately soiling any part of the vehicle, deliberately leaving a syringe or sharp instrument in the vehicle and refusing to pay the fare agreed in advance. I know taxi men and women who, unfortunately, have had people getting sick in their cars and abusive drunks threatening them.This Bill will clear the jungle and make the taxi business safer and more professional. Without being patriotic, I would say that Longford taxi drivers are the finest. I commend the Bill to the House.

Those who drafted it had many issues to take into consideration. The entire taxi deregulation saga has been bloodied. Since deregulation was introduced, I have seen severe hardship. I come from an area where we do not have many taxis, but I have a connection with the Galway City rank. I am appalled that the hardship money has not been paid out. There is a time and place for such payments, and people should receive them when they need them most. I am sure the Minister of State knows exactly what I am talking about because his office must be jammed by queries about this. Whatever about the rights and wrongs of the matter, something had to happen in the taxi market. Whether or not it should have happened in the way it did is an entirely different matter because it was a very blunt instrument. While we cannot turn back the clock, I understood that before the last election when a promise was made to establish a hardship fund, the taxi drivers concerned would not be left for 12 months without any money.

It goes without saying that the operation of the hardship fund is a big job but people have been robbed by what happened when deregulation was introduced. I am aware of the case of a young taxi driver who, two years ago when deregulation occurred, had just got married. He and his wife had just started living in their new home for which they had paid €175,000 with a full loan. He bought the plate for €75,000 and three weeks later it was useless. It is bad enough to have to pay so much for one's house, which everybody else must do also, but it is worse to have to pay for a taxi plate that is of no use. Three weeks later they found that every Tom, Dick and Harry was able to get a taxi licence for €5,000 and before they knew where they were, there were three times as many taxi drivers. If the Minister of State does not understand this, he should.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Deputy Connaughton without interruption. If you addressed your remarks through the Chair, Deputy Connaughton, there would be less interruptions.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The Minister of State is provoking me, although that is not his normal course but he has a bee in his bonnet on this issue. The case I have cited is only one of hundreds more. Not alone did the person have to work longer hours but they also had three times more competition. The result was that the man and his wife tried to provide a full 24-hour taxi service to try to earn sufficient money but, of course, the whole system broke down. That family has had to leave the taxi business. Given that they are not currently involved in the taxi sector but were totally robbed by the system, will they receive money from the new hardship fund? I understand that the overall compensation is relatively small so are we talking about just a couple of thousand euro? If so, it would not pay for the ink on the paper. I assume that the taxi drivers themselves understand what is happening so they will know what is coming, although I am not privy to that because I am not involved. I assume they know, however, that all they will get is a pittance compared to what they lost. It is bad enough to realise that there is almost nothing coming but it is worse to have to wait a year to get it.As the Minister of State is so forthcoming, perhaps he will outline whether they have to wait until the statutory regulator is in place before any money is paid out.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	524	Perhaps he will be able to comment on that in his reply. Irrespective of how wide-ranging the investigations were into who should or should not receive payments from the hardship fund, I cannot see how there could be such a hold-up in making them. I do not know who is involved in all this but I got the impression that once the election was over the Government thought the taxi drivers would go away. That is the impression the taxi drivers had also but it did not happen. I never saw such hasty statements in the press as those made by the Minister for Transport on the day the taxis drove along O'Connell Street a week or two ago. It appeared that everything was put into place in a few hours then, although nothing could be done for two months before that. The taxi associations had to take to the streets to make their case and it was only then that the Government took notice.There is a lot of good sense in the Bill. I cannot say that I spend much time in taxis because I do not have access to them where I live. I have never seen anything wrong with the taxi service whenever I use it, either here in Dublin or in Galway. I always thought taxi drivers did the job they were being paid for but one reads in the press about terrible things happening, particularly late at night. That is something that the new commission will have to get a grip on. The taxi service forms an integral part of the country's transport infrastructure and never before have we had a more mobile population than now – whether for business or pleasure, including tourism. The taxi sector always did, and always will, form an important part of the transport business generally. If confidence-building measures can be built into the industry in future, nobody will feel there is any danger in taking a taxi at any time of the night or in any part of the country. I assume that is what the Minister of State is getting at.It is important that irrespective of what hour of the morning it is, teenage girls in particular should feel safe in taking a taxi to get home. The commission has a major job to put in place procedures – in so far as it is possible to do so – to ensure that nobody slips through the net and that nobody is driving a taxi who should not be. I assume that only a small number of taxi drivers would be errant in their ways and would take advantage of the occasion for wrongful reasons. I hope the commission will weed those people out because the last thing the ordinary decent taxi owner and driver wants is to have a shadow over the organisation. In fairness to the spokespersons, they have gone a long way to ensure they are 100% behind this, and well they should.There is another, more general question to which I wish to refer and which many of my colleagues on this side of the House have mentioned. Having been a Member of this House for a long time, my interest in the matter is personal. It relates to the link between what the commission does and what we in this House do on behalf of the people. Over the years I have noticed that when I put down a Dáil question concerning roads, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or the Ceann Comhairle's office, inevitably reply to the effect that the Minister has no responsibility in the matter. It is the same in regard to waste management and so on. I do not like that, and I have a strange feeling that the people do not like it. It is the wrong approach to adopt. Because the Minister has a keen appreciation of what people think, I am sure he would agree there should be some sort of accountability to the House for the commission's actions, and that on matters relating to aspects of the taxi business that are causing problems I should be able to put down a question to the Minister for Transport and get an answer without having to put pressure on any section within this House. The same should apply to the Minister for Transport on more general transport questions. I do not know the Minister's personal views, but it would be a huge mistake to take accountability away from the House on those matters because, whether we like it or not, the taxi business, taxi journeys, taxi fares, the condition of taxis, timetables and so on feature in the run of everybody's life, particularly if they live in cities, and they would like to believe there is a mechanism for public accountability and that they will be able to ask questions through their public representatives in Dáil Éireann on matters relating to the workings of the commission. I strongly urge the Minister to look seriously at that on the various stages of this Bill.I want to dwell on wheelchair accessibility for a moment. As Deputy Power drew to our attention, it is part of the remit of the commission. I am somewhat surprised, therefore, that in the Minister's presentation wheelchair accessibility is not mentioned. I would have thought that if this is considered to be a major matter it would be screaming at me from the page. It is a major matter now, and I am surprised that it is not here in bold print that, whatever else the commission does, it will ensure that taxis are wheelchair accessible. I fully appreciate there is a huge cost factor, but this is at the very kernel of what the Year of the Disabled is all about. The disabled either have rights or they do not. That applies irrespective of the disability, whether they have Down's syndrome or are in a wheelchair or whatever. If they are to go about their business in the same way as we so readily take for granted in our lives, it comes down to a rights-based approach. People who have a disability should have a right to the same level of accommodation in whatever area they are involved, in this case the taxi service, as the Minister or myself or the Ceann Comhairle.When the Minister is replying to this or on Committee Stage, I would like to know whether he is giving a commitment that the commission will ensure that all taxis will be wheelchair accessible or whether there will be a different approach. Will a certain percentage of taxis have to be wheelchair accessible? Will that be left up to the taxi owners and drivers? I would like to hear the Minister's views on exactly what sort of direction the Government will be giving the commission. That is what most people want to find out today. If it is going to be left to the commission, in other words, if the Government washes its hands of it and leaves it to the commission to decide what level of wheelchair accessibility will be needed, I can see huge trouble coming down the tracks. I am not an expert, but I understand that wheelchair accessible taxis are quite expensive, certainly more so than those that are not, and we live in a commercial world. If taxi drivers are given access to the bus lanes and all the other facilities they need to get people from place to place, particularly in cities, there will have to be an onus on them to provide the sorts of facilities that will help people in wheelchairs.The next question is who will pay for that. If the Government is no more flaithiúlach with its money than it was in its treatment of hardship cases, it is unlikely it will decide to put money into wheelchair accessible taxis. The question is whether this legislation means it will be mandatory for people who own taxis to make the changeover within a certain period of time and if they do not they will not get a licence. That is what I would like to hear the Minister comment on because that is the central issue. I do not doubt for one minute that any Government would want to see wheelchair accessible taxis on the streets of our cities and towns, but how we arrive at that is an entirely different matter and I would like to hear the answer.I am sorry I do not have more time because I have only got going. I compliment the Minister on the C2 certificate. I sincerely hope that means only bona fide people will get into this business. That is a very important step forward. I sincerely hope the low morale among the taxi fraternity will change. It does not suit this country to have so important a body as taxi drivers feeling they have been cut off from society, that nobody cares about them or that they were let down. They are going through a bad time at the moment, but I hope they will return to profitability. It could be argued that what happened in Dublin City by way of deregulation had not the same impact in Galway, Sligo and other places, but I do not have time to go into that. They are two different worlds, two different problems.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Funnily enough, I am. I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and I also welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate our colleague, the Minister for Transport, on his work in this regard. I share a constituency boundary with the Minister and I was happy when the boundaries were redrawn and many of his electors voted for me.All of us are aware of the lobbying and the public pressure that many in the taxi sector have engaged in over the past six months. I welcome the Bill. It is possible to get a taxi most times whether it is day or night in every major city throughout the world. The cost of the service is reasonable in most cities and the standard of the vehicles is high. It would be inappropriate to revisit the period prior to deregulation, save to ask what has become of the compensation awarded to hardship cases when the new licences were issued.My constituency embraces Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills and many of my constituents make their living from taxis. I am proud to be one of their Deputies and I will endeavour at all times to support and protect their livelihoods and that of their families. It should not be forgotten that taxi drivers are self-employed and take on all the costs and risks associated with that. They can only earn income when they work and they must invest in a vehicle that meets the needs of their business.Many of my constituents have followed the dream of self-employment and invested significantly in small businesses and local retail outlets only to find, regrettably, that they failed not because of a lack of effort on their behalf, but because of the changes in the local business environment. These people were full of enterprise but they received no State support and had to get on with rebuilding their careers. This is the potential impact of a failed dream and taxi drivers take the same risk.Taxis are an essential part of our city's public transport system and the need for standards and regulations is important and essential. All taxi operators agree with and support the need for such standards and, similar to all citizens, they accept such regulations will always be seen by a few as unfair. Over the past year I have been made aware of the many horror stories about safety in taxis. These incidents are to be deplored but they involve a two way process as the passenger on many occasions places the life of the driver at risk.The regulations outlined in the legislation, which I strongly support, will ensure the public will be assured as to the character of the driver but the onus is on people to behave in a responsible manner. The regulator should draft a service charter between customers and the industry and promote it to highlight the responsibilities of both the customer and operator of the taxi service. The quality and comfort of the taxi fleet in Dublin City and county has been upgraded completely and this is the result of market needs and competition.I recall being confused as a small child regarding the role of a taxi. Sometimes when my parents were able to afford it, we would take a taxi from the city centre to Crumlin, where I lived at the time. That was a Dublin of a different era but I always had an appreciation of the public service provided by taxi drivers. The rank in those days was also on St. Stephen's Green and it has changed little over the years.When one travels abroad – I have not been abroad very often – one gains an understanding of the need for taxis. I appreciate the work done by the Minister for Transport and it is ironic, given my appreciation of the work of taxi drivers, that I am proud of the development of the Luas to Tallaght and Sandyford. Despite all the disruption that affects the public and taxi drivers, people are looking forward to the introduction of Luas.I have the opportunity to work in the city and long may I stay in this job but I look forward to the day when I will not have to drive home to Tallaght. I will be able to walk into the city centre, cross the River Liffey and catch a train to Tallaght every day. I refer to this in the context of my comments on taxis and I strongly support the legislation.A number of issues have been raised about the service provided by taxi drivers, the type of people who drive taxis, the standard of cars and so on. The uniform colour of cars is a marketing nicety that is not necessarily essential. If a uniform colour is introduced, a five year programme should be undertaken so that existing licence holders can convert their cars. Signage should be standardised and issued by the regulatory body at the lowest cost and as soon as possible. Advertising on vehicles should only be controlled in terms of location and scale. I often notice the advertising on taxis and it is appropriate. The use of advertising on taxis will develop and at election time slogans will be seen on taxis. I do not suggest that all political advertising is tasteful but such advertising is acceptable.I have the opportunity to make representations on behalf of taxi operators in my constituency and I often highlighted the need to facilitate taxis when meeting the promoters and developers of amenities such as The Square, the civic centre, the library, the hospital and the basketball arena in Tallaght. Where taxi ranks can be facilitated, it is important to do so. It is also important to continue to support the taxi industry's view that the public should be able to access taxis easily. My constituents should be able to call on a taxi travelling to and from the city centre with ease. Deputy Connaughton pointed out that people should feel safe when they return home in taxis. There is a responsibility on all of us to promote that sense of safety.

Before I came into this House I often heard of tension between what happened inside and outside the Pale. The new challenge for this Dáil will be to reconcile what is happening in Tallaght with what is happening in the rest of the country. Deputy O'Connor is certainly leaving his mark on the constituency he represents.I compliment the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, on the initiatives taken by their Department in various areas and particularly in this issue. It is refreshing to see how their policies and initiatives are presented and followed through with tangible commitments both in legislation and infrastructural development.When I listened to Deputy Connaughton's remarks I could not help remembering that the only contribution of the Rainbow Government was to devolve the whole issue of taxi regulation to the local authorities.

There is no uniformity of presentation or fees and no effort made to protect the rights of taxi drivers or their passengers. No criteria were laid down for the use of the funds raised by local authorities from taxi fees which were and are being collected under that scheme, which currently operates. I believe Deputy Howlin was the Minister responsible.I welcome this wide ranging Bill dealing with almost every aspect of the industry in a detailed, comprehensive and constructive way. In looking at a Bill I always ask myself how this House can police its measures. How can Dáil Éireann hold the taxi industry responsible for what it does? I am glad to see that section 25 gives the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee of the Oireachtas the right to bring the commission or the commissioner before it to deal with the issues of the day. That is to be welcomed.I agree with Deputy Connaughton that there is an issue about parliamentary questions. I would like to see that matter dealt with so that parliamentary questions can be asked on issues relative to the implementation of the legislation.I am glad section 11 includes an allowance for the use of fees by the commission for the development of taxi ranks within local authority areas. I hope that provision will not be watered down or put to one side. It is an integral part of the Bill. It is essential for local authorities to find the funding somewhere. If we give them a job to do they should be given the funding along with it. Until now that has not been the case in most aspects of local government. This Bill will create a need to provide taxi ranks. There is an absolute necessity for expenditure by local authorities, particularly in rural areas where the culture of using a taxi service is at the growing stage. It is essential that this part of the Bill be activated under the commission and that a true taxi service be developed in rural areas.The regulations are enshrined in the legislation but they will be developed by the commission. They must be spelled out clearly so that taxi drivers will have a uniform approach to their rights and to the manner in which they conduct their business and so that the customers will know their rights and what is expected of a taxi driver in any urban area in the country.It is also essential that the current costs of renewing a taxi licence or taking out a plate be laid down clearly. Apart from the cost of the plate itself several hidden costs are added on. These hidden costs are a feature of many industries. I have experience of the transport industry. Purchasing a licence, replying to surveys, doing tests and all sorts of bureaucracy which have been added on over a period of time have cost the transport industry a small fortune and are making it almost non-competitive in comparison with its international trading partners.The cost of the suitability test for a taxi is €89 while the cost of the NCT for a private car is €48.40. There is very little difference between a taxi and a private citizen's car. The tests are, basically, the same with only one section added for taxis. How can that difference result in a doubling of the cost? Is this just another example of business being penalised in an over-regulated market? If a taxi driver wants to transfer a licence to a new car the transfer cost, which is another piece of bureaucracy, is €125. It was done free when the gardaí were registering these cars in the local Garda station. The cost of permission to pick up passengers in a particular location, such as Dunnes Stores car park in Kilkenny, is €100 per annum. A taxi driver must pay €100 before he even picks up a fare. That cost is controlled and can be increased every year.The question of the quality of some of the licences issued to taxi operators is taken up in various sections in the Bill. This must be examined in depth, particularly given recent reports in the media. It will be part of the commission's work to ensure that licences are issued to suitable people. The provision of the C2 certificate is to be welcomed. It is required in the general haulage business and there is no reason it is not required in the taxi business.I have seen it reported that one in five taxi businesses in Dublin fail. I do not know whether that is true or false but I know it is becoming more difficult to make a living from the use of a taxi plate. That is certainly the case down the country. In large urban centres the numbers of people using the system is sufficient for most drivers to make a reasonable living but in rural areas the culture of taxi use is still not sufficient to support the number of taxi plates being issued by local authorities. There is no ceiling on that number. The commission will have to take account of the number of taxi plates that have been issued. Continuing to issue plates will make it extremely difficult for people to carry on their businesses and for the trade to develop in a meaningful way.My last concern is the transport of drugs by taxi. We must be particularly careful. I would urge the commission to take full account of the character of a person receiving a licence.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	531	As a frequent user of the taxi service, I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute on this Bill. As Opposition spokesperson on tourism, this has particular relevance to tourism. The majority of tourists who would come to this city will at some stage use the taxi service and at times the first person with whom they will interface could be a taxi driver. For that reason, a proper well-regulated taxi service is critical for the tourism industry. As a former Minister for tourism, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, would fully appreciate this. A positive or negative impression can be given immediately to somebody leaving Dublin Airport or some other port of entry into this country through his or her first encounter with a taxi driver. That is why the taxi service is critical to the tourism sector.Many tourists who would come to Ireland for the first time will obviously want directions to a hotel or guesthouse and it is important that the taxi drivers, under this Bill, will be required to have a deep geographical knowledge of this city. At times we have all encountered taxi drivers, to whom the passenger would be giving directions rather than seeking to be driven to a place. It is important that taxi drivers would be familiar with street names, B&Bs, hotels and other venues in the section of the city in which they operate which people would be likely to visit.Taxi drivers also should have a broader knowledge of the city. It probably would be difficult for taxi drivers to know the whole city, but they should have a general knowledge of areas outside those in which they would be operate normally. Certainly if a taxi is collecting people at places like Dublin Airport or Heuston or Connolly Stations, the driver should have a good general knowledge of the city. There is nothing worse for somebody visiting Ireland, or indeed for any of us abroad, than to jump into a taxi and then need to explain in detail where one is going. When a taxi driver is not knowledgeable, it can be quite worrying and unsettling for passengers who have just arrived in the country. For those reasons, this is an important Bill from the perspective of the tourism industry.Often tourists must trust strangers. As previous speakers outlined, there have been a number of incidents where the vulnerability of tourists, especially women, who would not be knowledgeable about the geography of Dublin, were exploited by taxi drivers. There have been a couple of high profile cases of this nature outlined in the media over the past year.From a tourism perspective, taxi drivers are important. They give an impression of a country. They are the ones who often advise people where to go for entertainment. They take visitors to their destination when they arrive here and play a more important role in the tourism industry than people may realise or appreciate.This debate began when deregulation took place. The problem arose when the Government introduced taxi deregulation overnight without bringing in strict entry criteria, without setting standards and without looking for qualifications from drivers entering the business. While I personally had no problem with deregulation at that time, as someone who would use taxis a great deal to get to the airport, the railway station or around the city, I often had to wait long periods for taxis. Nevertheless this Bill should have been introduced before the deregulation occurred.At the time, the taxi unions forced the hand of the Government. The taxi unions were confident, since Members on the Government side of the House had given them so many commitments and they had campaigned for some of the Deputies, that it would not happen but it did. However, it was introduced in an unstructured manner and the problems which have arisen since, which I will outline shortly, arose from the fact that deregulation took place without adequate preparation. That was the problem.No doubt the Government will say there are now 10,000 taxi plates on the streets of Dublin, whereas there were 2,900, and that has been a help. It is a great convenience that one can hail a taxi almost as easily as in Manhattan because there are so many taxis on the streets, but that is still not what happens late at night when often one must still wait a long time for one to arrive. The problems arose because there was no preparation and this was a major shock to the system. There was no structure in place to meet the numbers which applied overnight for taxi licences.According to a large number of taxi drivers, another point people are overlooking is that a large number of them have been made redundant. They are people in their 40s and 50s who are leaving jobs in light engineering and other industry which are closing down or they are being made redundant. They are not qualified for any other job and as a result these people are entering into the taxi service, and they are delighted to be able to do so.It is important that this large number of people taking on the job of taxi driver would have to go through certain procedures and these are outlined well in the Bill. The Bill refers to personal issues. I understand that the Bill will include provision that taxi drivers will have a dress code. We should also look at the question of smoking in taxis. Taxi drivers should realise that they have a major responsibility to their clients and they should be courteous at all times. These are all very important attributes of taxi drivers who are in an important, responsible position.On the condition of taxi vehicles, last year there was an article in The Irish Times where a reporter went around to examine the cars used as taxis. He wrote that taxis ranged from BMWs to bangers and some of these bangers were running 24 hours a day, and up to 65,000 miles a year in city traffic.There are some taxis on the road which are kept clean and fresh, and I would always comment to a taxi driver if it was obvious he was looking after his car. However, one has also had other experiences, where taxis are not kept clean or fresh, and are not very comfortable. The important thing is that this Bill provides for a quality taxi service in Dublin, with well-qualified drivers and good cars. If this Bill can achieve that, it will be very welcome.The question is how well deregulation has worked. In answer to Deputy McGuinness, the old system was working very well in Kerry. The devolution of that power to local authorities worked well in Kerry. I cannot speak for other counties. I am very familiar with Listowel Urban Council. Both the council and the taxi people worked closely together. If an extra taxi was needed, they agreed to allow a licence to be issued. It was well regulated. They were making a decent income. After deregulation some of the better taxi people went out of business because they were no longer earning a decent income. We lost some very good people. The same applied in Tralee. I hold a clinic in Tralee every Monday evening and I have real sympathy for the large number of taxi drivers. There are sometimes about 100 taxis queuing up and waiting for a fare. It is pathetic and only the fittest will survive in the business.Deregulation worked in Dublin where it provided extra taxis. It did not work in areas of the country because there was no need in many places for extra taxis. It is a pity deregulation could not be ringfenced and restricted to the major urban areas. It may not have been possible but it would have worked better.The experience in Kerry is that when the flood gates were opened, people came into the business. Many people had lost their factory jobs and had no qualification for anything else. In order to work and to be out of the house, they took out a taxi licence.I foresee an important role for local authorities and this Bill provides for that role. I ask the Minister of State to outline further what role local authorities will play in future in the licensing and regulation of taxis. There will be a need for some form of regulation. This Bill is designed to make it more difficult for people to join the taxi business by the imposition of stricter standards.Deregulation has worked during the daytime in Dublin. At the weekends and late at night I understand one may have to wait for up to two hours for a taxi. There is no compulsion on anyone to do night work. Many drivers are reluctant to work late at night because the city has become so dangerous. Taxi drivers have been attacked and often their fares are not paid. This anti-social behaviour in the city discourages drivers from working at night. Their wives are reluctant to see them work at night.Deputy Naughten made the point that taxi drivers must work about 70 hours a week in order to make a living. I understand this is in breach of the health and safety regulations. Taxi drivers must drive at speed and in traffic and can become tired. This can be the cause of accidents. The physical fitness of taxi drivers should be considered. The normal working week is 40 hours and some taxi drivers are in the car a lot longer than that. This can lead to tiredness and lack of concentration which in turn can lead to accidents and injury to others or to the taxi drivers.The complaints made against taxi drivers should be considered in terms of how these will be dealt with by the Bill. In 2001, 509 complaints were made against taxi drivers and in 2000, the number was 220. There are more people operating taxis as a result of deregulation. There is a lowering of standards and less scrutiny by the Garda. In 2002, the number of complaints rose to 540 and to date in 2003, the number is 217. According to statistics provided by the Garda traffic division one in seven cab owners – I suppose that also relate to drivers – has a criminal record; 17% of complaints relate to taxi drivers behaving in an abusive manner; 1% of complaints relate to sexual assault; 50% of all complaints against taxi drivers relate to over-charging; and less than 5% of all complaints reported to the Carriage Office in Dublin lead to prosecution. That is a low prosecution figure and I ask the Minister of State to comment on it. Some 42% of drivers who were reported received a formal caution. Since deregulation in 2001, six new taxi drivers have been implicated in major drugs deals. Three new taxi drivers have been found dead in their taxis from a drugs overdose. There have been ten allegations of rape made against taxi drivers. These facts were reported in The Irish Times on 26 May 2003. Deregulation has resulted in more cars on the streets. There are now 10,000 new plates issued. The quality of service, the quality of cars and the quality of the personnel in some cases has deteriorated as has the overall standards of the taxi service both in Dublin and elsewhere.The Minister for Transport is reported as stating that it was out of control and he likened it to the jungle. I hope this Bill will restore the control needed. The Irish Times reported that there have been 129 attacks in a two year period on members of the public travelling in taxis. The man at the centre of the X case was jailed for sexually assaulting and kidnapping a 15 year old girl. Those are the problems we are facing in Dublin. We should be aware of developments in the taxi industry. We can see the scenario that has resulted. I would like to mention some of the provisions of this Bill.

I will finish by saying that I welcome this Bill. It should have been published before deregulation took place, or very shortly afterwards, but I appreciate that may not have been possible as a consequence of time constraints. It is certain that there will be major problems in removing undesirable people from the taxi industry. Will this Bill be retrospective? Will the people to whom I have referred have to go through the various procedures outlined in this Bill? I ask the Minister to respond to these questions as it is obvious that there are some bad apples in the taxi industry. If one wants to achieve the level of standards desired in this Bill, one will have to remove such people from the taxi service. How does the Minister propose to do this?

We all know that one of the Minister's priorities on coming to office was to attempt to solve the problems experienced in the taxi business. I congratulate the Minister who has offered in this Bill concrete solutions to problems experienced by almost every person in Ireland.The Bill allows for the appointment of a national taxi regulator as chairperson of the independent Commission for Taxi Regulation. The new commission will introduce a range of new structures and detailed provisions that will provide for the establishment of high quality services by taxis, hackneys and limousines on a national basis. The commission's main aim will be to ensure that small public service vehicles and their drivers provide a professional, efficient, safe and customer-friendly service. A national taxi council will advise and make recommendations to the commission and the Minister about regulations, standards and codes of practice for the industry. Under the Bill, representatives of the taxi, hackney and limousine industries, local authorities, the Garda and consumer, disability, tourism and business interests will come together to form a 16-member council.The Bill will provide for the implementation of the findings of the taxi hardship panel. Those who claim they have suffered hardship as a result of the liberalisation of the taxi industry in November 2000 will have a chance to make a complaint, which will then be assessed, and those who are successful will receive a payment.Under the Bill, the principal functions of the national taxi regulator will be to licence and control the operations of small public service vehicles and their drivers, to oversee the development of a professional, safe, efficient and customer-friendly service, to set the standards to be applied to vehicles and their drivers and to establish requirements in relation to the age and minimum size and capacity of vehicles. The regulator will deploy a range of qualitative standards to be complied with by those seeking to be licensed as drivers, including a high standard of knowledge of the area in which they will operate. It will also promote the development of high-quality, cost-effective services that meet a wide range of customer needs, including those of passengers with mobility or sensory impairments. The regulator will also inspect small public service vehicles and set out a dress code for drivers. The Bill will lead to the development of a professional, safe, effective and pleasant service.It is sad that most people who get into taxis are concerned for their safety. Many young women feel the need to make a telephone call as soon as they get into a taxi, to let somebody know where they are and how long they will be. It is regrettable that one cannot feel safe in a taxi alone. Concern about safety has grown since the alleged rapes of three women earlier this year. It is simply not good enough that taxi drivers are not vetted sufficiently. We have a responsibility to the Irish people to provide for public safety.I welcome the fact that this Bill will ensure that an applicant for a taxi licence with a conviction for any one of a range of serious offences, including rape, murder, manslaughter, assault, drug trafficking and a sexual offence, will be automatically disqualified from being granted or holding a licence. A separate disqualification is provided for in the case of drivers convicted of dangerous driving and driving under the influence of drink or drugs.It is also essential that drivers are protected under this Bill. Numerous drivers have told me that their cars have been defaced and vandalised in the past and I am aware that many drivers have been assaulted. It is not right that taxi drivers who are simply trying to make a living should have to tolerate such risks, which would not be tolerated in any other job. For the first time in the history of the State, it will become an offence to soil a cab or to assault a driver. It will be an offence to rob the driver, which is what many people do when they leave without paying their fare.The high quality of the service provided by the taxi industry in County Mayo, especially in the towns at weekends, should be noted by the House. Taxi drivers help to bring young people safely home to rural areas late at night. This Bill is essential for the safety of Irish citizens and for the livelihood of taxi drivers. It will make the streets of Ireland safer for passengers to travel in and safer for drivers to work in. I commend it to the House.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I welcome the Taxi Regulation Bill 2003, the purposes of which are to provide for the establishment of the commission for taxi regulation, to draw up a code for the regulation of taxis, with a strong emphasis on the establishment of a quality taxi service with a consumer-orientated licensing system, and to establish an advisory council to the commission, which will advise on all matters relevant to taxis and taxi drivers. I congratulate the Minister for Transport for the speed and efficiency with which he has brought forward this Bill, which was published just a few days ago. The fact that we are discussing this Bill tonight demonstrates the determination of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to deal with this important issue.I would like to state that the provision of a taxi service is not just a Dublin issue. Despite the Dublin-based publicity that followed the decision of the previous Government to open up the taxi service, taxis operate in every town in the country. As a result of the numerous discussions I have had with passengers and drivers in Sligo, I do not doubt that the issues which arise in the frequent reports about the taxi service in Dublin are applicable to every town in the country.It is important that the taxi service is safe and reliable for those who use it. Taxis of a recognised standard of safety and comfort should be made available. There should be regulations to protect those who travel in taxis. We should ensure that taxi drivers are also protected while they ply their trade. It is important that a good and easily accessible service is made available to the public. Taxi drivers and passengers should be able to operate in a safe and secure environment while they go about their business. This Bill deals with all these issues.The main objectives of the commission are outlined in section 9 of the Bill. Section 9(2)(a), which states that the commission shall seek “to promote the provision and maintenance of quality services by small public service vehicles and their drivers, and section 9(2)(c), which states that the service should be “professional, safe, efficient and customer-friendly”, sum up adequately the aims of this Bill.I welcome section 9(2)(g) of the Bill, which refers to “customer needs including those of passengers with mobility or sensory impairments”. It is essential that taxis that can accommodate people with a physical disability are provided. The cost of providing such taxis is considerably higher than the cost of providing a normal taxi, however. I ask the Minister for Transport to direct the commission to provide incentives to taxi owners who make available cars that are suitable for disabled persons. This is necessary to ensure that this important section of the population is catered for. Such incentives might include directing local health authorities to provide hospital runs to such taxis and special taxi ranks outside hospitals. Taxi licences could be made available at a much reduced rate for those who provide wheelchair-friendly taxis.I note with interest section 11, which gives the commission the power to provide financial assistance to local authorities so that they may support the development and provision of infrastructure to facilitate the operation of taxis.One area of concern which has been mentioned to me is the provision of taxi ranks. The location of taxi ranks is a source of much discussion in many areas. Narrow streets are a feature of many towns – and I include Sligo in this regard – and these compound the difficulties of coping with the ever-increasing volumes of traffic. There is no point in providing taxi ranks at locations that are inaccessible to members of the public. It is not simply a matter of designating a particular location as a taxi rank. Under the terms of the Bill local authorities now have access to funding which they can utilise to make the necessary infrastructural changes so that ranks are located where the public can use them. It should now be possible for local authorities, be they corporations or county councils, working in conjunction with the Garda, the public and the taxi drivers to provide safe well-located taxi ranks. I urge them to utilise the funding which the commission will have at its disposal.Section 34 deals with the regulation of taxis and their drivers. In the recent past the press reported instances which caused a high degree of public unrest. Such cases included taxis that were not of the required standard and drivers who were unfit to be licensed to drive such vehicles. This section is comprehensive and covers many of the issues that have caused public concern. While the number of such incidences have been few, it is still of the utmost concern that any fears or worries that members of the public might have, are allayed. This section is most welcome and should ensure that the carriage of the public is done in a safe and secure way.I also welcome section 35 which gives any applicant for a taxi licence, or the holder of such a licence, the right to appeal if his or her licence is refused or revoked. The fact that they have the further right of appeal to the District Court should ensure that the rights of taxi drivers are fully protected.Section 36 deals with applicants for licences or licence holders who have been convicted of serious charges such as murder, sexual offences, drug trafficking offences, money laundering or firearm offences. Such safeguards are essential to reassure the public that the person driving the taxi is a fit and responsible person. While I have no doubt that the number of drivers, or potential drivers, who fall into these categories is incredibly small, yet it is essential that the driver of a taxi is a fit and responsible person. Females and younger people are often alone in taxis late at night. This section of the Bill should reassure all users of taxis that their journey will be safe and secure.Sections 41 and 42 deal with the designation of taxi meter areas. It is important that fares for journeys are clearly known in advance by the user of the taxi service. There is a clear and comprehensive procedure to be followed before fares are fixed. This will ensure that these fares, be they for single or shared journeys, are well known.I was unable to ascertain on reading the Bill if these maximum fares should be publicly displayed in the taxi. They should be available to the passenger on request. The rate of the fares should be in printed form and it should be a regulation that the driver should produce a copy of such fares on request from a passenger. This would remove any areas of disagreement between the driver and passenger at the end of a journey.The proposal to have a uniform colour and/or design for taxis has caused some concern. If regulations are to be introduced concerning the above, it should be the policy of the commission to give ample time and notice of such to industry members. It is unfair to tell a taxi owner who may have just purchased a car that that car may have to be changed in order that it conforms to regulations. I expect the commission to engage with each local taxi owners' association so that compliance with the regulations concerning colour and make of car are well flagged in advance.The issue of the colour of taxis is the cause of some debate. As we all know, the cabs in New York are yellow and London has black cabs. I suggest – somewhat tongue in cheek – that each county might have taxis in its own local colours. If this were adopted, the black and white of Sligo would be a constant reminder of our native county pride. I see Deputy Perry nodding in agreement across the Chamber.I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I am delighted to speak on the Bill. I endorse the suggestion of Deputy Devins in regard to the colour code. As he said, the yellow cabs in New York are very distinctive.The Bill will establish the regulatory framework for the control and operation of public service vehicles and their drivers. The legislation of this service-oriented growth industry is very much to be welcomed.As Deputy Devins said in regard to Sligo, the deregulation of the industry brought in many much needed new operators. With so many new entrants there is a greater imperative on the Minister to regulate the service. It is important to pursue a high quality, customer-oriented licensing system and standards as well as to supervise the development of a professional, safe and efficient taxi service to promote competition. It is vital to promote the protection of service users and providers, as well as to promote the integration of taxis with other elements of public transport. The Minister is currently examining the monopoly of Iarnród Éireann. Competition is an important element of any industry. We are fortunate to have the rail service to Sligo. There is a demand for a high-quality service which meets the needs of customer.I heard Deputy Connaughton speaking on the Bill. His concern was for the customer and the level of safeguards provided. It is also important that those providing the service abide by a code of conduct which is paramount in every service.Section 10 allows the Minister to give policy directions to the commission and that is an area on which I would have some concern. The implications of what is meant by this are unclear.Section 11 permits the commission to provide financial assistance to local authorities to develop taxi services. That is an important provision. We are all aware of the situation in Dublin city but as the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, is aware, from Letterkenny to Sligo to Galway this is a growth industry. It is only right that controls are in place to regulate it. The Minister of State has been closely involved with the Minister in the introduction of the drink driving controls and the points system. It is important that this new and developing industry is properly regulated, and is perceived as such, as it develops in towns like Sligo, Donegal, Galway and other smaller towns.Section 18 of the Bill deals with the staffing of the commission, which will be subject to the agreement of the Department of Finance. It is critically important that it should be responsible to the Minister of the day, as well as to this House and its committees. While there is reference to the autonomy of the controller, ministerial direction is also important.Section 28 obliges the commission to produce a strategy statement every five years. That should be reconsidered with a view to having an initial retrospective assessment after the first two years, which might be regarded as a probationary period. With the increase in the number of taxis in Dublin from 3,000 to 11,000, proper regulation is obviously required. Against the background of unrest among taxi drivers in Dublin with regard to the situation to date, transparency in the work of the commission is essential.Section 36, which deals with disqualification of drivers, has been the subject of comment by several speakers. Section 38 provides for the keeping of a register of licence holders. Provision should be made for corresponding county registers. An appropriate code of conduct is an essential element in regulating 11,000 taxi drivers in Dublin alone, apart from those in the rest of the country. That is a huge job and I know the Minister of State is conscious of that.The current development involves bringing enterprise into the small public service vehicle licence system, which also includes hackney licences. The hackney sector has been regarded as a cheap way of getting into the taxi business. As the Minister of State will be aware, hackney facilities have always been a key service in small towns and villages, especially in areas such as Donegal and Sligo. There has been a degree of contention between hackney and taxi services which, no doubt, he is taking into account in the Bill.Section 53 provides for the establishment of an advisory council, consisting of 15 people, to advise the Commission for Taxi Regulation. That body should be comprised of representatives from a range of interested parties such as the Garda, PSV operators, disability organisations, tourism and business. No doubt the Minister will secure a good mix of representation in that regard. It is very much in the interests of the Department to get this right, having regard to the concerns of disability groups and the business sector, including IBEC and the small firms association, in relation to the growth of that service. The advisory council should be representative of service users, big and small, on a country-wide basis.On the matter of ministerial direction to the commission, perhaps the Minister of State, in his reply to the debate, will outline what he has in mind in that regard. At an earlier stage in the debate, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, placed considerable emphasis on the need for a competitive, fair and transparent market.Section 19 enables the commission to engage consultants. This, once again, highlights the Government's heavy reliance on consultants. While I am not suggesting that consultants are not necessary, one must be careful about the ethos involved. In a sense, we are liable to be driven by consultants, who will not necessarily solve all problems. Yesterday, the Minister for Transport referred to the M50 motorway project as being driven by too many consultants, who still got it very wrong. We must be very careful with regard to consultants.Section 34 deals with the duration of licences, which is not specified in the Bill. Instead, the intention is to allow the commission to decide the duration and to draw up regulations in that regard. I suggest the Minister should give further consideration to that issue. The present provision seems unsatisfactory. The duration of a licence is a matter of such fundamental importance that it should be expressly stated in the Bill, rather than being prescribed later by regulations, although I appreciate that regulations are necessary in some respects, such as in relation to current tax clearance certificates.Section 36, which deals with disqualification of licence holders, should not set out to be exhaustive, in terms of setting out particular offences, as it currently does. The present approach in section 36 is deeply flawed and I ask the Minister to re-examine it.Under section 13, the commission will consist of between one and three commissioners, to be appointed by the Minister under section 14. The controller will obviously be a key appointment. I assume the person appointed will already command substantial respect within the trade and be a well known authority in that regard.In general, this Bill is very necessary in terms of bringing regulation into a largely unregulated market. The previous deregulation process greatly accelerated the level of participation in this business. I support the point made by Deputy Devins on the importance of recognising the interests of consumers. One sees a huge variety of cars involved in the provision of this service. Proper standards are essential, including the NCT testing system, accessibility for people with a disability and so on. This involves substantial investment by taxi owners, including the back-up technology required for this business.In the context of Dublin, a proper level of service should be available at any given hour, rather than allowing people to cherry-pick in terms of the more favourable hours from the taxi operator's point of view. The ideal would be, as in New York, that one could hail a taxi almost instantly. It is not desirable to have too many part-time operators in the market, perhaps working at weekends on the basis of cash in the hand. We should ensure that we are not fuelling the black economy. The viability of the business for the more professional operators is liable to be put at risk by certain part-time operators who simply cherry-pick as a means of topping up their main income. Full-time taxi operators should be clearly distinguished from part-time operators. A commitment to a certain level of service should be required. The huge intake of new entrants within the last year is likely to include a considerable proportion of people with other full-time jobs who simply operate a taxi service on a part-time basis during evenings and weekends.There is potential for development of the taxi service in County Sligo. Deputy Devins referred to the provision of taxi ranks. No doubt the Minister will work with local authorities in terms of defining areas for taxi parking. Prior to deregulation there were 17 taxis in Sligo. The number has now increased to 80, which has given rise to major parking problems. More taxi ranks are also needed in Dublin to improve accessibility of the service.It is important that the commission be empowered to take effective control of the situation. I hope it will be given powers with immediate effect.

I have raised a variety of questions with the Minister for Education and Science on the wider Act and on one university in particular, Dublin City University, which I believe is in breach of the Act. However, the Labour Court recently decided that the adjudication of whether it was in breach of the Act and the matter of a union with which it had a difficulty is not a matter not that court.In response to my questions the Minister for Education and Science always returned to the Universities Act 1997 stating that the Act confers autonomous statutory responsibilities on universities in the day to day management of their affairs and that the conduct of staff relations is a matter for each university in accordance with section 25 of the Act. No doubt the Minister of State will repeat that to me tonight, and he is welcome to do that. However, I believe there is a discrepancy in the Act which might suggest that it needs amending. It is important to highlight that there has been a serious dispute involving one member of staff in DCU who was dealt with by management in a manner not agreed with by SIPTU under the 1997 Act. This person was basically told by a rights commissioner that the university had no case. The Labour Court also upheld his appeal, yet DCU is still prevaricating to the extent that the individual concerned is in severe financial straits.There is a side story to this issue, which involves allegations of bribery by members of staff who encouraged students to give up the lecture on science and society this lecturer was giving in DCU. I met a student who stands over these claims. However, despite trying to raise this matter in a number of ways, to date there has been no joy in regard to it. I will leave it to other jurisdictions to decide what is the position in relation to the alleged bribery, but it is on record and DCU management is aware of it, yet nothing has been done to deal with the allegation.This raises a wider issue. The lecturer concerned was dismissed without agreements and procedures being made with SIPTU. Section 25(6) of the Act states, "A university may suspend or dismiss any employee but only in accordance with procedures, and subject to any conditions, specified in a statute made following consultation through normal industrial relations structures operating in the university with recognised staff associations or trade unions." SIPTU contends such procedures have not been followed and normal consultation have not taken place with the university in question. It is for possibly another jurisdiction to decide that. However, I want to know who decides the procedures? Should a university decide to take it upon itself to interpret or police the Act, does that not make the university its own policeman? If that is the case, is there not a weakness in the Universities Act 1997, in that, should a union or an individual have a grievance or a contention that the Act was not adhered to, is it not up to the Minister to adjudicate in that case, or is it a matter for the courts?Will the Minister of State for an opinion on this matter? Perhaps he could give one in writing at a later stage following consultation with legal advisers. DCU seem to be the bad boy in this case. At some future date UCD, Maynooth and other universities could allegedly act in breach of the Act, but who is to say whether they are acting in breach of it. I ask the Minister that question. Who adjudicates whether a university is in breach of the Act? It is no good asking a university, through the Higher Education Authority, whether it is in breach of the Act because its representatives will reply that the university is in not breach of it. That is not good enough. Somebody else must adjudicate when there is a contention over whether the Act is being followed, and that is the information I hope to get from the Minister of State tonight.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I can give the Deputy the up to date position on the matter, but I cannot give him an answer to the specific question he asked.The Universities Act 1997 provides a framework of legislation that is compatible with the role, function and operation of universities in modern society. The Act, which was the first Act of general application to all the university institutions since the foundation of the State, was a culmination of an extensive process of consultation and debate within and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. The process began in 1992 with the publication of Education for a Changing World, the Green Paper on Education and was developed through the subsequent White Paper on Education, Charting our Education Future, published in 1995, which contained a commitment to legislate in this area.Among the significant features of the Act was the provision for revised governance structures for the universities which ensure that all major stake holders are represented on the university governing authority, the principal decision making body of the institutions. The establishment of more representative and democratic structures was also extended to the academic councils of the universities.The Act also sets out a framework for interaction between the universities and central government. This framework strikes a measured balance between the institutional autonomy of the universities and the requirements of public accountability. The Act explicitly recognises the centrality of academic freedom and institutional autonomy to the mission of the universities, while addressing the obligations of the institutions on equality of opportunity and access, quality assurance, the effective and efficient use of resources and the requirements of public accountability. The Higher Education Authority is given key functions in respect of these areas of the operation of the universities.Within this overall framework, universities operate in a very public context and come within the scope of a vast range of legislative and other requirements such as the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Freedom of Information Act, as well as the full range of employee protection and industrial relations legislation that applies to all employers.In November 2001, the Minister for Finance circulated a Code of Practice for the Governance of State bodies. The code aims to ensure that State bodies operate to the highest standards applicable in the interests of transparency and accountability. While third level institutions are not best described as State bodies, the Minister for Education and Science has taken the view that an adopted form of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State bodies should apply and the Department of Education and Science is working with the sector in producing a code of practice appropriate to third level institutions that will further reinforce the good practice already exercised in the sector.The Universities Act 1997, in addition to providing for strengthened governance arrangements at an institutional level, also provides a wider public interest protection in cases where the Minister for Education and Science is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for contending that the functions of a university are being performed in a manner which prima facie constitutes breach of the laws, statutes, or ordinances applicable to the university.The Minister for Education and Science is aware that Deputy Gogarty has raised this issue previously in the context of a particular ongoing case involving a staff member in one university. The Minister does not propose to comment on that case and it would not be appropriate for him to do so, particularly as his understanding is that it is still going through due process.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Minister is satisfied that all the legislative machinery of the State as it applies to employers generally, in respect of their obligations to staff, consumers and to public bodies in relation to best practice governance and accountability requirements, is applied and adhered to by the universities. The Universities Act goes further in terms of the governance arrangements that it provides for within the sector and in respect of the additional protection provided for in the role of the visitor and Minister where there is a prima facie cause for concern about any of these matters.In this context, I am glad to be able to assure the Deputy that all reasonable and necessary arrangements are in place for ensuring that universities exercise full compliance with all of the legislative and other requirements within which they operate on a daily basis. I accept what the Deputy is saying. I presume when he talks about all due process that includes the governing authority, and that the trade union he mentioned has at least one representative on that governing authority.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I welcome the opportunity of raising the important issue of the conditions for teachers and students at the national school in Kilfinane, County Limerick. I recently visited the school and saw at first hand the conditions that pertain there. I ask that the Minister immediately provide funding for the construction of a new school at Kilfinane.It was made clear in the report of the Irish National Teachers Organisation that the facilities at the school are unsatisfactory and have been so for years. This school is the base for a remedial teacher who is shared among five schools. Her classroom, which is a cubicle partitioned off a room, is also used as a staff room, library and office. The resource teacher works in similar conditions. The disruption is continuous and not conducive to learning. It renders the teacher's job particularly difficult and places the children who learn in that environment at further disadvantage. There are no indoor PE facilities, general purpose room and place for children to leave their gear for outdoor games. The staff are enthusiastic to encourage the use of computers but with so little space it is extremely difficult. Toilet facilities for staff are inadequate, while the outdoor facilities for children are Dickensian. I doubt that the school building would pass examination by the Health and Safety Authority.It is more than six years since representations were first made regarding improvements to this school. The feasibility study carried out clearly shows that a new building is the only viable option. A site has been acquired for this purpose. The Department of Education and Science has commissioned a feasibility study on the site and found it suitable. The staff of the school want what is best for the children of the parish. They also need practical working conditions to enable them to carry out their professional duties. They have found themselves frustrated over the years. The school has six teachers, a shared remedial teacher, a full-time resource teacher and a part-time resource teacher and 147 pupils.In January 1998 the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science for a grant to carry out major structural works and in 1999 it received a reply offering a grant for indoor toilets and a staff room. This was unacceptable and everybody in the area and in the Department of Education and Science now accepts that a replacement school is required. Approval for a new school was granted in February 2001. When I brought up this issue on the Adjournment three years ago the reply was that there was a need for a new school and because of this refurbishment could not go ahead.The existing building dates back to 1909 – the school is housed in a converted church. It consists of six small classrooms, three of which are only 35 square metres in area. There is a tiny ancillary room which is used as a library and a tiny office and cloakroom. There is also a small central hall which can be accessed from the classrooms. Some of this hall space has had to be sacrificed to accommodate the secretary's office. There is no staff room and the toilets are situated outdoors. The playing space outdoors is very limited and because of this, teachers are concerned for the safety of the children.Three of the classrooms are seven metres by five metres in area and house classes containing between 25 and 30 pupils. Partitions between the classrooms are wafer thin, consisting of narrow timber boards or glass, and fail to be soundproof, which causes difficulties for teaching and learning. The timber floors have begun to sag in many areas due to the building's design. Ceilings are very high and temperature extremes are common. The fact that the present school is situated on a steep slope also presents safety problems. There are many unavoidable drops and steps within the site, which are hazardous and always a cause of great concern to teacher and parents.Local Government TDs claim that the delay in acquiring the site accounts for the lack of progress in providing the new school. We accept that the acquisition of the site was slow – it took from February 2001 to November 2002 – but that was completely outside the control of the board of management and the teachers. The Department knew about the school's problems in 1998 and 1999 and had acknowledged them with, for example, feasibility studies. It is now convenient for the Department to blame lack of progress on the delay in acquiring the site. Surely the primary school community in Kilfinane cannot be penalised for a delay over which nobody had control?There is evidence of dry rot and many of the windows cannot be opened, leading to a lack of adequate ventilation. The playing space is also inadequate for the pupils and drinking water is not available to them. Sinks are provided in only three of the rooms. There is no staff room, proper library, principal's office or remedial teacher workbase. There is occasional evidence of rodent infestation. The Minister should immediately examine the proposals to construct this school and implement them.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I can outline to Deputy Neville the current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects in general, with a comment on this particular school. The Minister for Education and Science decided to publish the 2003 school building programme on the departmental website to give the maximum amount of information concerning the school's capital investment programme to managers, boards of management, principals, parents, students and all other interested parties. The criteria used for selecting projects were also published for the first time. This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated six years ago, and includes funding for temporary accommodation. The 2003 programme will deliver more than 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, hundreds of schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme by means of funding for minor projects and temporary accommodation and, of course, all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.An application for a new school has been received from the management authorities of Kilfinane national school. However, available funding does not allow for the commencement of architectural planning for further large-scale projects this year. As to when individual projects can progress to architectural planning, that will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. In the meantime, the management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grants to deal with urgent health and safety matters.I accept what the Deputy has said. I can convey his views to the Minister, but there was obviously a long time between the feasibility study and the current stage. It was not possible to build any form of extension to the school. As the Deputy said, time moved on and it was difficult to find a new site, although it has now been secured. Architectural planning for the school has not yet commenced, which indicates that things are at a relatively early stage of planning.

Rapid progress will have to be made. There has been a delay, which was nobody's fault. The possibilities of doing repairs or building an extension were investigated but because of the cluttered nature of the site, that was not possible. I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister, but the project is at an early stage and approval for architectural planning is needed if it is to move fast.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of bringing up this matter on the Adjournment. The pupil to whom I refer has very special needs. She is about to attend Cuilmore national school ar an Choil Mhor. This is an overcrowded school which is already listed as substandard, with deficiencies, including a lack of suitable additional classroom accommodation for the existing 34 pupils with the capacity to cater for the special needs of this pupil. Facilities, including a classroom assistant for supervision in the classroom area, assistants for toilet requirements and supervision in the playground area must be in place before the pupil's schooling starts. Also required are a Heathfield chair, size three; an adjustable height computer table; access to a computer; an area for changing with a mat, changing bench or berth and hygienic disposal of nappies, or the fitting of a children's toilet with two drop-down rails in the girls' toilets; and repair or replacement of the concrete in the playground.A formal application was submitted in 2001 for a new school building. The current building is over 63 years old and no longer meets the guidelines set down by the Department of Education and Science as suitable accommodation for a primary school. I can vouch for this wonderful, viable, rural community, committed to retaining its school, which is seen as the heart of the neighbourhood and community. The building is damp and in order to retain a comfortable temperature in the classroom the heating must be on all day. When pupils return after the summer holidays, the new books purchased in June are already damp and covered in mildew. Each year the school has a problem with rodents, which gain access to the building due to the sunken rotten floor.The area limits in each classroom are totally inadequate at 18 sq. meters. This renders both rooms overcrowded and they cannot meet the needs of the three special needs pupils attending the school, with another child to come. In addition, they do not have accommodation for the remedial teacher, resource teacher or a co-ordinator to visit the school. The sanitary facilities are substandard and there are great problems with sewage back-up in the children's play area, as a small sceptic tank installed 60 years ago cannot cope with the increased population in the school. The school grounds are so limited that they are unable to relocate the tank. There are no facilities in place for the physically or visually impaired. Access to the school is via steps, leading from a busy and dangerous main road.This is a brief outline of the problems that exist in the school. It is a two classroom school, linked by a long damp corridor. The rooms measure 6.5 metres by 5 metres, which is totally inadequate. There is a tiny principal's office which also serves as a resource room, catering for three visiting teachers, learning support resource and BTC. There is a tiny storage area and a very uneven dangerous school yard. There are no proper staff toilets, no toilet for disabled persons, no hot and cold running water, no hand washing or drying facilities and no drinking water. The heating system is inadequate. The school windows and doors are rotting and there is evidence of dampness, mildew and rodent infestation. The corridor linking the classrooms is damp.There are problems in the area of health and safety. The school has no fire doors, exits from the classrooms are inadequate, no fire escape, no smoke alarm, fire alarm or burglar alarm and no proper fuse box. There is no security lighting. The floor is in an unsafe condition. There are potentially dangerous overhead power lines near the school. The school yard is inadequate and dangerous. There is no general purpose hall, principal's office, staff room, secretary's office, resource room, remedial room, medical room, multi-purpose room or computer room. The classrooms are overcrowded. There is no access to the building for disabled persons. There is no car parking area or bus turning bay. There are no secure staff lockers or children's lockers and storage is inadequate. All the following are in substandard or unsafe condition: plumbing, school yard and grounds, entrance gates, surrounding walls and fencing, wiring, roof, plasterwork, pest-proofing, furniture, boiler house, shelter, sceptic tank and drainage.The management applied in September 2001 for a new school. The Department is well aware of the situation in the school and the need for something to be done. The school has been pro-active. The board of management had plans drawn up to merge the existing two classrooms into one and build and additional classroom and two ancillary rooms for resource and remedial tuition. They employed at their own cost the services of a chartered county surveyor to cost the project at €260,000.In September 2003 the school will enrol a pupil with very special needs. She suffers from the rare disorder of absent femur syndrome. Therefore, it is quite clear that something needs to be done in this regard. I hope the Minister of State will address the issue as a matter of urgency.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The matter the Deputy raised was to outline the facilities required for a pupil with special needs to attend the school. However, most of his contribution was about building a new school.I am pleased to take the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the question. An application for resource teaching and special needs assistant support for the pupil in question was submitted by Cuilmore national school, Newport, County Mayo, and received in the Department of Education and Science on 23 December 2002. As part of a review process carried out by the national educational psychological service, the school was requested in March to submit all relevant professional reports supporting the application for examination. A reminder issued to the school in April and the national educational psychological service recently reported that the documentation had not yet been forwarded to them. In recent discussions between officials from the Department of Education and Science and the school authorities, they confirmed they would submit the relevant documentation to the Department's special education section. The application for the foregoing supports will be considered when this documentation is received from the school.The school submitted an application for a computer grant for the pupil in question on 30 May 2003. All relevant documents on this matter were referred to the school inspector for recommendation and when the process is complete, a decision on the application will be conveyed to the school. The Department of Education and Science's capital programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website. An application for improved accommodation has been received from the management authorities of Cuilmore national school.However, the Department does not intend to allow further largescale projects into architectural planning during 2003. The timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary allocation for next year, the rate of progress of existing projects currently in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria.In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works. The Department of Education and Science's primary building unit received an application for special needs furniture from the management authorities of Cuilmore national school. The Department's building unit is willing to grant aid the furniture and equipment requirements for the pupil in question on receipt of quotations from the school.I hope this gives the Deputy the up-dated position. Whatever about a new school building, it appears the immediate needs of the pupil will be met provided the paperwork is submitted and in order.

I want to know how an unregistered and illegal dump in a scenic area, which I believe is being considered as a wildlife protection area, could conduct its business for years, with trucks coming and going without anyone in South Tipperary County Council knowing about it.Under the legislation passed in the House I tried to investigate this matter with the officials concerned. The reply I received was that I should put my request under the Freedom of Information Act, which is unacceptable. Why was Dúchas, which forms part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, using the dump? Last Monday morning, a Dúchas truck dumped all sorts of material in the illegal dump, including literature from Dúchas. This unregistered dump near a fen is surely a risk to contaminating the local water table. The lock on the gate leading to the dump is of Dúchas issue, one which is commonly used throughout the country by Dúchas. A sign located in the site is exclusively used by Dúchas and it is my understanding that this illegal dump may be used exclusively by Dúchas, not just by its Kilkenny depot but by a number of other depots located in the area. I cannot say with certainty the length of time this has been going on, but I have reason to believe it has been going on for years. Furthermore, I have reason to believe that hazardous material such as asbestos has been dumped by the sack load in the dump. A Government agency has not only broken the law but has done so in a manner that is appalling to contemplate. What did the Dublin-based managers know about this? More to the point how could they not know that Dúchas was dumping lorry loads of waste in this illegal dump?As I have said already, I believe a number of depots were involved. Where did they think the material was going? This is not something that can be laid exclusively at the doors of local managers. At best this is mismanagement or at worst gross incompetence. There is a lack of knowledge or a turning of a blind eye – both are equally damning.Over the years I have asked many questions of Dúchas and it has frequently demonstrated by way of answer to those questions its lack of interest in being accountable. I appeal to the Minister of State to raise the appropriate questions with this organisation to ask if there are other—

He should determine how this arrangement was brought about within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Dúchas, and how it was paid for by the Department. If it was using and paying for the facility, either the Department or the local organisation must have known about it. As a result of my experience with Dúchas I do not accept that it can conduct within its organisation an inquiry into this matter. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there is an independent inquiry conducted by someone outside the organisation.The list of items dumped includes galvanised steel, plastic buckets and builders' and other material. We need to find out how long the dump was used, what was dumped there and what are the intentions of the Department in reclaiming the land or restoring it to the way it once was as agricultural land. A full explanation is required and I ask for immediate action.

Since taking office, the Minister has gone on record on several occasions to make it clear that waste management is one of the Government's top environmental priorities.Substantial powers are already available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to tackle this problem. Under section 55 of the Act, a local authority has the power to order measures to be taken in relation to the disposal of waste as they see fit, including the remediation of any effects arising from illegal activities. I am aware that several authorities have availed of these powers and have taken action. Section 56 of the Act empowers local authorities to directly take appropriate actions to remedy or counteract such activities and to recover their costs through the courts.Sections 57 and 58 provide for access to the High Court and for orders in relation to remediation to be made. So the legislation is there. In addition, the maximum penalties for illegal waste activities are a fine of €12.7 million and/or ten years imprisonment, which are quite substantial.The Government has already demonstrated the seriousness with which it views illegal dumping. The Minister's predecessor requested the Garda Commissioner to assist in the investigation of such activities in Wicklow. In response, the Commissioner assigned a large, full-time investigative team from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation to investigate the allegation of criminality in connection with unauthorised dumping. While the initial focus of the investigations has centred on activities in Wicklow, the ongoing investigations are not limited to any geographical area.Substantial powers and further amendments are being introduced on Committee Stage of the Protection of the Environment Bill which is currently going through the Oireachtas to increase the maximum fine to €15 million with associated increases in other fines and to provide that the courts in considering penalties to be imposed will have regard to the costs of remediation required. Other amendments to that legislation are also proposed.In addition to the increases in allocations to local authorities from the local government fund, the Minister will shortly be announcing funding from the environment fund to directly support local authorities in ramping up their overall environmental enforcement effort, with a particular emphasis on combating dumping and other unauthorised waste activities.Obviously the legislative framework exists. However, there is a problem, a culture and an ethos in some places, and it is hard to get through to people. I heard what the Deputy says. Dúchas now forms part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It was taken over last year in the reorganisation of Departments by the incoming Government. Sections of it will soon go to the Office of Public Works. On behalf of the Department I deeply regret that unauthorised disposal of some waste appears to have occurred from the Kilkenny depot. The matter has only come to light recently and it is being investigated.The Deputy referred to Dublin-based officials. The Oireachtas and Dublin-based officials can promote and pass legislation, but people on the ground around the country have to be the eyes and ears of the regulatory authorities. I do not know how these illegal dumps come about and whether they are coming from Dúchas depots or elsewhere without people in the know not seeing and reporting them. It is embarrassing for the Department that there has been illegal dumping in any form. It is wrong and I totally condemn it. On behalf of the Department I deeply regret this and we have instructed that an immediate investigation into this incident take place. The Secretary General will get a report on the case as a matter of grave urgency.Once legislation is passed it is everybody's responsibility to try to enforce it and act as the eyes and ears of the Oireachtas throughout the city and country so that such legislation can be meaningful.The Dáil adjourned at 7.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 20 June 2003.

In addition, under section 30 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, the Legal Aid Board has responsibility for deciding how legal services should be provided, including the location of law centres, the appropriate staffing for those centres and the use of private practitioners.The Deputy will be aware that the grant-in-aid to the Legal Aid Board for this year is €17.075 million. While this figure represents a slight decrease of just over 3% on the grant-in-aid for last year, it still represents a significant increase in funding for the board in recent years, up from €10.656 million in 1997 to €17.075 million in 2003, an increase of almost 62%. During this period also, sanction to employ additional staff was conveyed to the board. Since 1997, sanctioned posts in the board's law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, including eight additional posts. These combined additional resources contributed to a significant improvement in waiting times throughout the board's law centre network during this period.I can inform the Deputy that during 2001, which is the most recent complete year for which figures are available, the board provided legal services to a total of 14,200 persons. At the end of May 2003, average waiting time for a first appointment with a solicitor across the board's 30 law centres was five months. This ranges from a lowest waiting time of two weeks at one law centre up to 13 months at the law centre with the highest waiting time. However, I can inform the Deputy that 17 of the board's law centres have waiting times of less than four months, with only the one law centre already mentioned having a waiting time in excess of one year. I would point out that these figures do not include priority cases, which account for over one fifth of all cases dealt with by the board and where an immediate legal service is provided without the persons concerned having to go on a waiting list.

This is the first comprehensive review of structures and operating systems of the Garda Síochána since its establishment. The review has looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. I expect to receive the SMI steering group's report in this matter in the near future and I will give careful consideration to all its recommendations, including any it may make on the opening hours of Garda stations.

In these operations, specialist patrols and vehicles are concentrated in such areas to deal with public order and ‘joyriding' incidents.In addition, persons serving prison sentences for persistent offences related to ‘joyriding' offences are not granted early temporary release from prison except in the most exceptional circumstances.The gardaí are constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are in operation which have proved valuable in dealing with offenders. The Garda and local authorities are working together in relation to estate management and reducing the opportunities for ‘joyriding'. For example, as the Deputy will be aware, physical changes such as barriers and speed ramps are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.Cars without tax and insurance are impounded by the gardaí and removed to compounds. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound located at the Talbot complex in Santry. Car compounds are being provided at all newly built divisional-district headquarters provided that there is sufficient physical space on the site.

It should be noted that this requirement applies to the bar only and not to other parts of the premises."Age document" is defined in section 15 as including a passport, an identity card issued by a member state of the European Communities and a driver's licence. While the majority of non-national visitors under the age of 21 will be in possession of one of these age documents, it is possible that young visitors from the UK may not possess such a document because of the common travel arrangements.

In the two years after deregulation, there were 11,009 public service vehicles and 1,049 complaints in the same region. These figures indicate an absolute increase in the numbers of taxis and hackneys of 72% with an increase in complaints of over 100%. These figures are in respect of the Dublin metropolitan region only as the information could not be collated on a national basis in the timeframe allowed for this question.The House will be aware that the procedures for granting public service vehicle licences are being strengthened in the Taxi Regulation Bill which was published by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, this week. In particular, the Bill provides for automatic disqualification of a licence holder who is convicted of certain serious criminal offences which are specified in the Bill.The Deputy may wish to refer to my answer to Parliamentary Question 23 on 6 February 2003 for the procedures currently in place to deal with applications for small public service vehicle licence applications.

I am aware, however, that similar proposals were piloted in a neighbouring jurisdiction with very mixed results. I also wish to consider this matter in the context of the overall measures which might be taken to address the problems of late night public order offences and in light of more recent research and analysis such as that contained in the recently published report of the National Crime Council into public order offences in Ireland.I am considering the use of fixed penalties procedure coupled with a formal caution in relation to lesser public order offences. If that procedure leads to significant reductions in court hearings, it may become a relevant consideration in assessing the usefulness or effectiveness of night courts.

While it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond that point for as long as the cap on public service numbers remains in place, this in itself will represent an all time record level of strength.A range of factors determine the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. I want to emphasise that I am committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way I can in tackling crime, not only through increasing Garda numbers, but through facilitating and promoting change and reform, both within the force and in the criminal justice system in general, aimed at meeting the challenges of present day crime.I am, for example, finalising proposals for legislative change to significantly improve Garda powers of criminal investigation, and to both free up and supplement Garda resources to enable them to be concentrated on front line policing activities.I also intend to press ahead, as quickly as circumstances permit, with the civilianisation, on a phased basis, of up to 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing.

In these circumstances, the members of the group informed me that completion of their work would, of necessity, take more time than they had previously envisaged but that they would present their report as soon as possible. I understand that the work of the group is well advanced and I hope to receive its report in the near future. When I have considered the report I will make a statement.

The anti-discrimination provisions of the Equal Status Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill are both in the area of civil legislation and as such provide a means of resolving disputes between individuals by way of compensation rather than punishment.On 17 June 2003, the Government approved publication of the new Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003, which includes a provision to transfer jurisdiction for cases of alleged discrimination involving licensed premises – apart from accommodation related matters – from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court.

The expenditure was made in respect of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest, personal injuries and other alleged wrongs suffered by civilians.The reality is that civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for any alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State counsel.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	572	In my replies to a number of previous parliamentary questions in relation to the report entitled A Survey of the Level of Learning Disability among the Prison Population in Ireland, I have indicated there are strong reservations in my Department about interpreting the main finding of the study as suggesting that over 28% of the prisoner population in the country have a mental handicap. Any such suggestion is strongly disputed by people who work with prisoners in a professional capacity on a daily basis and there is a reasonable basis for argument that this unexpectedly high figure could be accounted for by measurement of factors attributable to educational deficit and social disadvantage, rather than learning disability per se.As I indicated in my answer to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 642 and 680 on 7 May 2003, the director general of the Irish Prison Service has indicated that the particular recommendations relevant to the service are being considered in the context of the care and rehabilitation services for prisoners. My reply on that occasion also indicated what is already being done in the prisons in relation to prisoners with learning disabilities. The situation in our prisons has been transformed since 1997. In the past, a persistent high level of overcrowding resulted in the granting of release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. The construction of over 1,200 new prison spaces in recent years has effectively ended that situation. Six years ago, a total of 19% of the prison population was on temporary release. In 2003, that proportion has been reduced to 8%. Alternatives to custody are being developed and utilised, where appropriate. In this context, greatly increased resources have been made available to the probation and welfare service in recent years.The Government has introduced legislation, as required, in areas such as public order and liquor licensing, and will continue to do so.There can be no doubt of the progress made to date in the area of crime and no doubt of our continued commitment to maintaining and improving our criminal justice system throughout the lifetime of this Government.

In accordance with the agreed programme for Government, these extra gardaí will be assigned to the areas of greatest need. The number of gardaí will be higher again as soon as budgetary circumstances permit the Government to make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007.Tackling crime effectively requires that the courts are equipped to provide speedy and efficient trials. Overall support for the courts has been greatly improved in recent years by the establishment of the independent Courts Service. The Courts Service has devoted a great deal of effort to streamlining the administrative supports for the courts including the introduction of modern IT systems where appropriate. A recent very important initiative taken by the Courts Service Board was the establishment of a working group which is undertaking a root and branch look at the organisation of our courts. The group is to examine any necessary changes to allow for the fair, expeditious and economic administration of justice – including the creation of new, or the alteration of existing, jurisdictions.

For example, the Minister for Health and Children has responsibilities in relation to public health policy, while road safety legislation comes within the remit of the Minister for Transport. As the Deputy is aware, the allocation of responsibilities to Ministers and Ministers of State is a matter for the Taoiseach.As regards my responsibilities in relation to the liquor licensing laws, I am pleased to say that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 has been published and has already been presented in the Seanad. Second Stage has been completed and I am hopeful that the remaining stages will be concluded today.The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2003 to respond to certain recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and to concerns outlined in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol. Also relevant in this context is the special initiative on tackling alcohol misuse set out in chapter 2 of the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.Following a discussion of the general scheme of the Bill with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights last week, I adapted the content of the Bill to take account of certain concerns expressed by the members of the committee.I expect that the Bill will come before the Dáil next week and am hopeful that it will be enacted before the summer recess.

We are both in agreement that, far from leaving non-national parents and their Irish born children in a legal limbo, the judgment of the Supreme Court of 23 January 2003 has in fact clarified the constitutional and legal position greatly. It is clear from the judgment that the parents of an Irish born child, contrary to what is supposed to have been the prior existing position, do not derive a right to reside in the State from the fact that they are such parents. It is also clear that the Government may determine to deport an immigrant family, notwithstanding the effect of the removal of the Irish born child, without violating the child's rights. In the instant case the Supreme Court upheld my decision to deport parents of Irish born children. It is also clear that the general requirements of the common good are a significant factor in the determination of these cases.Many non-national parents who have had a child or children born in this jurisdiction appear to have assumed that they could not be removed from the State because they had Irish born children. That assumption was mistaken and was never based on information supplied by me or my officials. The question to be decided therefore is the manner in which I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, seek to carry out my function as the Minister of Government charged with making decisions of this kind. My decision will be informed by Government policy on the matter, the constitutional rights of the children in question and the exigencies of the common good. I want to ensure that whatever mechanism is put in place to deal with these matters has the capacity to withstand any objective analysis in terms of effectiveness, fairness and transparency. My intention is that it will be sustainable in the longer term and will be a considered response rather than a hasty response taken in the interests of political expediency.

I am not satisfied that any departure from this practice, particularly along the lines suggested by the Deputy, would be in the public interest.

The revised Estimates for the Public Services for 2003 show that the grant-in-aid for the authority for 2003 is €5.16 million. Some 45 posts and eight contract posts are approved for its staffing. I am of the opinion that this level of resources is sufficient to enable the authority to carry out its statutory function to work towards the elimination of discrimination in our society.I do not expect that additional resources will be required by the Equality Authority to assist complainants in taking cases of prohibited conduct, including discrimination, to the District Court. It is my intention that, under the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003, the Equality Authority will have its existing powers of representation under the Equal Status Act 2000 transferred to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill in relation to prohibited conduct, including discrimination, directed against any person in licensed premises.The Equality Authority has discretion under the Equal Status Act 2000 to grant assistance if it is satisfied that the case raises an important point of principle or it appears to the authority that it is not reasonable to expect the person to present adequately the case without assistance.The assistance provided by the Equality Authority may be in a variety of forms, for example, the provision of case law precedent, legal advice, advice in relation to the running of the case, or legal representation. The Equality Authority has delegated the decision-making function in relation to which cases to support to the chief executive officer, subject to certain specified criteria and also subject to internal review by the board of the Equality Authority. The current interim criteria for representation were set out in an appendix to the annual report of 2002, copies of which were laid before the Oireachtas on 5 March 2003.The decision on whether or not to provide representation before the District Court will rest with the Equality Authority on the same basis as representation is currently provided before the ODEI – the equality tribunal.

In that response, I indicated that a framework proposal had issued to the association with a view to early negotiations on a new way forward and that the Irish Prison Service had invited the association to discussions in that context.These discussions are focused on the operation of the proposed new annual hours system and the detailed attendance and payment arrangements which will need to be put in place.While it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail on the discussions, I am in a position to report that Irish Prison Service management is satisfied that a constructive and intense application to negotiations by both sides is under way. This active engagement of management and staff interests in addressing this long-standing issue is most welcome.Notwithstanding the sensitive and complex issues involved, I have reiterated to Irish Prison Service management the urgency with which this matter must be addressed, and I look forward to an early positive outcome to the current negotiations process.

In this regard the NACD recently published a study on the prevalence of opiate use in Ireland. It is worth noting that this first formal estimate of opiate use since a 1996 study noted a decrease in the reported figure for opiate users in Dublin from 13,461 in 1996 to 12,456 in 2001. This being said, the Garda Síochána annual policing plans set the enforcement of the legislation in relation to drugs as one of the primary objectives of the organisation.

It is now at an advanced stage of recruiting an additional six members which will bring its full staffing complement to ten, as it requested. I have already indicated that the commission's ability to service the public is limited until such time as it has its full complement of staff. However, I believe this stage will now be achieved fairly quickly. The commission recently published its strategic plan for 2003-06. The plan sets out key areas of work on which the commission proposes to focus over the next four years. The commission's budget allocation for this year is €1.28 million.

Prior to the implementation of that Act in November 2000, immigration officers received training concerning, inter alia, their obligation to assist asylum applicants in making their applications.In the first five months of this year almost 600 people claimed asylum at our airports and ports. During the 12 months of 2002, 1868 people claimed asylum at these points of entry. In addition many more claimed asylum at the Refugee Applications Commissioner's office in Mount Street. This evidence of the situation generally is not consistent with the allegations contained in the Deputy's question.

The Government has decided that this process should continue so that all bodies appropriate for inclusion are covered by end of 2005.A working group comprising members of the Garda Síochána and representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was established by the Garda Commissioner in March 2001 to examine all issues arising from the possible extension of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to the Garda Síochána and to prepare a detailed proposal of action for consideration by the Commissioner.Following on from this, the Commissioner has recently made a submission to my Department analysing the issues to which any such extension would give rise. I will carefully consider this submission before coming to a final view on the matter.

As regards equality matters, the report contained a number of suggestions for legislative changes, one of which was the transfer of jurisdiction from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court, but no formal recommendation.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including emigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found the inspectorate seek redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to emigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers.In 2002 the inspectorate undertook just over 8,300 inspections/visits mainly dealing with issues arising from more than 1,000 case-files, the national minimum wage, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and employment regulation orders and ensured the payment of €354,000 in arrears of wages to employees. A total of 32 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for legal proceedings, 25 of these arising from the investigative work of the labour inspectorate. To date, the inspectorate has undertaken 1,194 inspections/visits and ensured payment of €105,655 in wage arrears. Seven cases have been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for legal proceedings, all of these arising from the investigative work of the inspectorate.In addition to the investigative work undertaken by inspectors in 2002, work also commenced on the development of a new case management system to support streamlined work procedures in the labour inspectorate. The new IT system is due to come fully on-line by the end of June this year. It will be the result of considerable investment by my Department – approximately €900,000 when completed – and will provide the technological support to enable inspectors operate more effectively and efficiently in their interactions with employers and employees alike.Accordingly, I am satisfied that there are sufficient procedures in place and an appropriate level of inspection activity to ensure, as far as possible, that rights and entitlements under Irish law are being observed. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting emigrant workers I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.

This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The key elements of the package are as follows: increasing grant levels by 15%; extending the thresholds and increasing the gradations where there are less than four dependent children as follows: €0 to €32,000 for full grant; €32,000 to €34,000 for 75% grant; €34,000 to €36,000 for half grant; €36,000 to €38,000 for 25% grant; increasing the amount of the top-up grant to the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance, which, it is estimated, will benefit in excess of 7,500 students; and extending the threshold for the €670 student service charge from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the €670 student service charge.The maintenance grant schemes are being finalised taking account, where appropriate, the elements of the above package. I expect that the schemes will issue to the awarding bodies in the near future.

The school authorities were advised at that time that the question of permanent recognition would be considered when the Department was satisfied that long-term viability had been demonstrated and that the school was operating in accordance with the rules for national schools. Until such time as permanent recognition is granted to the school, my Department will not consider purchasing a site to permanently accommodate the school. If and when permanent recognition is granted, budgetary factors will then determine the rate of progress on the acquisition of a site and on the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.The school was made aware, on being granted recognition, that it was likely that a period of seven to ten years would elapse before permanent accommodation would be provided given the number of schools already awaiting permanent accommodation and that it would remain the patron's responsibility to provide interim accommodation. As part of the recognition process the school's proposals for accommodating the school were examined and in granting provisional recognition the Department accepted in good faith that the school had arrangements in hand to accommodate the school's growing needs for five to six years. The patron and board of management were instructed to undertake to develop and implement an enrolment policy that would, among other things, provide for incremental growth that would be manageable without overcrowding within the capacity of available accommodation. The available accommodation may necessitate the school in any year having to restrict its intake.

This proposed project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and has been assigned a band 2 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. The timing of when projects listed in section 6 and other sections of the school building programme can progress to tender and construction will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the band rating.

Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.Bus Éireann, which is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school transport scheme has advised that an extension of service for the pupil would cost approximately €8.22 per day. In the circumstances, it is not open to my Department to sanction an extension of service as the cost involved is considered prohibitive.

In the event of the school making the appropriate application to my Department, the matter will be considered in the context of the capital programme for 2004.

NEPS was established as a dedicated executive agency of my Department with effect from 1 September 1999. The financial outturn for NEPS for each year since its establishment was €1.111 million in 1999, €3.586 million in 2000, €6.261 million in 2001 and 11.097 million – provisional – in 2002.Since the establishment of NEPS in September 1999, the number of staff assigned to the agency has almost tripled, rising from 47 in 1999, to 139 at present. The number of staff working with the agency since its establishment in 1999 is 47 in 1999, 82 in 2000, 96 in 2001, 134 in 2002 and 139 in 2003 to date. It is anticipated that up to an additional 29 staff will be assigned to the agency, by the end of 2003. The further recruitment of staff will be undertaken as resources permit.

Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of special needs assistants rests with the relevant school authority. Appointments are made on an annual basis. The requirements for appointment to a special needs assistant post stipulate that appointees must be under 65 years of age on 1 September of the year in which they take up appointment. It is not possible to allow exceptions to this requirement in individual cases.

Under this particular initiative, my Department provides a grant to schools and control and responsibility for the planning and construction stages of the building projects is devolved to the school authorities. The pilot initiative is focused on enabling each of the participating schools, including Scoil Phadraig, Clane, to undertake a permanent solution to their immediate classroom accommodation needs.

Section 4 of the programme sets out the large scale primary school projects that are intended to be authorised to proceed to construction in 2003. My Department's building unit is currently assessing recent reports from the design team in relation to this project and expects to be in contact with the school authorities in the very near future concerning this project.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	628	Temporary qualified teachers are paid salary for the entire period of their employment, including vacation periods or other school closures that fall during the period of employment. A temporary qualified teacher who is employed throughout September or on the first working day of October and continuing in employment until the end of that school year will be paid for the summer vacation. A temporary qualified teacher taking up employment after the first working day in October and continuing in a temporary capacity until the end of June will not be paid for the summer vacation unless he or she secures further temporary or permanent work with effect from the following 1 September.Under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, short-term temporary unqualified teachers are entitled to holiday pay at a rate of 8% of the hours worked, subject to a maximum of 20 days in a school year. Temporary unqualified teachers also have entitlement to payment for public holidays provided that they have worked continuously for the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday. Such teachers are also paid for Saturdays and Sundays provided that they are employed before and after the weekend. They are also paid for all casual school closures and mid-term breaks provided that they are employed before and after the closure.Unqualified teachers should only be employed in primary schools in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. My Department has introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers and is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.
Question No. 93 answered with Question No. 79.

This is currently being examined. When the appropriate analysis has been completed a decision in the matter will issue directly to the school management authority.In relation to the proposed refurbishment of the school, in view of the scale of the 2003 school building programme as published and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, my Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow the refurbishment works to proceed. The timing of when this project can proceed is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the competing priorities for this funding.

Therefore the school is entitled to one extra mainstream class teacher. With the introduction of Giving Children an Even Break, schools already in receipt of additional teaching resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school referred to by the Deputy, retained their entitlements under that scheme. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher.Under Giving Children An Even Break, schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth classes. In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of Giving Children An Even Break in respect of the 2003-04 school year are determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2002.On the basis of this approach the school in question would exceed the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes in the 2003-04 school year, and consequently one teaching post under Giving Children An Even Break is due to be suppressed with effect from 31 August 2003. This post will now be retained as the eleventh mainstream post.The school authorities have been reminded that my Department allocates adequate staffing to schools to ensure that the Giving Children An Even Break maximum class size guidelines are implemented in both the junior and senior classes. If schools are unable to operate within the maximum class size guidelines for the 2003-04 school year they may make a submission on the matter to my Department for consideration.Schools for participation in the school completion programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using my Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools. The school to which the Deputy refers was not identified as a main feeder primary school for the second level schools selected to participate in this programme in the Dublin 5 area.

My Department received an application on behalf of the child for full-time special needs assistant support. This was considered by the national educational psychological service, which concluded that a full-time post was not warranted. This information was conveyed to the school authorities in April 2003.

Approval of a scheme was strictly on the basis that it would not lead to an increase in fishing effort in the existing polyvalent segment of the Irish fleet now or in the future. The scheme was approved by the Commission on the basis that the vessels involved targeted lobster, crab, crayfish and shrimp and would not target quota species.

Donors must be voluntary and non-remunerated and fulfil established criteria on the day they attend the clinic to donate. In general they must be in good health and have a clear medical history.I have been informed by the IBTS that persons who are carriers of the haemochromatosis gene, but who do not themselves have the condition, are accepted as blood donors. However, individuals with the disease are currently deferred.I have been assured that the IBTS are working closely with the Irish Haemochromatosis Society in monitoring developments in this field and if it becomes appropriate to accept donations from persons with haemochromatosis then the IBTS will respond to this development.

In 2000, the respite care grant was extended to beneficiaries of domiciliary care allowance.At this time it was decided that: the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would be responsible for paying the respite care grant to those providing care who are beneficiaries of the carers allowance/benefit only, or the carers allowance/benefit and domiciliary care allowance; and the Department of Health and Children, via health boards, would be responsible for paying the respite care grant to those providing care who are beneficiaries of domiciliary care allowance but who are not in receipt of the carers allowance/benefit.The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the domiciliary care allowance – which is a pre requisite for payment of the respite care grant – is a matter for the relevant health board. Accordingly, a copy of the Deputy's question has been forwarded to the chief executive officer, Western Health Board, with a request that she examine the case and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.As my Department only has responsibility for payment of the respite care grant in the case of domiciliary care allowance recipients, the Deputy may wish to contact the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.

Nine of these sites are in the ERHA, with three in each health board area, and the remaining eight sites are in the SHB area. The services provided by these units will include respite, convalesence, long-stay and rehabilitation.There are a number of stages in the PPP process which must be completed before these facilities will be provided. Public sector benchmarks (PSBs) are currently being prepared by the ERHA and the SHB, with the assistance of business advisers and the National Development Finance Agency, which will be submitted for approval to the Department of Finance this summer. They will test whether the PPP proposal offers value for money in comparison with the most efficient form of public procurement. If approved by the Department of Finance, the next stage for the ERHA and the SHB will be to advertise in the Official Journal of the European Community for consortia to design, build, finance and partially operate the facilities.

The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. An offender may be rehabilitated through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime. The probation and welfare service of my Department supervise those offenders undergoing community service orders.The making of a community service order is a matter entirely for the judiciary and one in which I have no function. However, the courts already have and do exercise wide discretion in using community service orders in dealing with people over 16 years of age who offend. It is used in practice for all age categories of offenders, first time or recidivist.Work projects are negotiated by the probation and welfare service with a wide range of community and voluntary agencies, usually resulting from an approach by the agency but, when necessary, arising from an approach to an agency by the service. An agreement negotiated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions requires that the work undertaken would be work which would be left undone if the labour was not made available through the community service order scheme. It also requires that the work undertaken would not normally be the work of persons employed by the organisation e.g. collecting litter.

The place and date of death must be known as certificates are issued under the jurisdiction of where the person died. A coroner cannot become involved in such circumstances. The presumption in law that a person is dead arises when it is proved that: the person has not been heard of for seven years by persons who would be likely to have heard of him or her; and all appropriate inquiries have been made.A person can apply to the High Court for a declaration that a person has died. The courts can make a declaration saying that a person is deceased which in turn may allow the other spouse to remarry even without a death certificate. However, as stated above, certain information is required in order for a death certificate to issue. Where persons have disappeared and cannot be traced, applications can be made to the courts for the purpose of distributing estates.

Our criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the growth of organised crime and specific measures enacted to meet our particular domestic situation. The strategy statements of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform set out the range of challenging goals and activities across the broad spectrum of the Department's activities, including the delivery of the Government's comprehensive initiatives to tackle serious crime.

If the Deputy has a more specific query in mind, I would be very happy to let him have whatever information is available.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.Under the Courts Service Act 1998 the Courts Service, which is responsible for the day to day management of the courts, is independent in the performance of its functions. I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, €92.179 million has been provided in 2003. This represents a 5.6% increase on 2002.Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the Service to decide how the funding provided is specifically allocated. The funding provided allows the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies and I am confident that the level of funding provided is adequate, not only to maintain existing levels of service, but also to provide for improvements in services and in court accommodation.
Question No. 139 answered with Question No. 134.

If successful, a grant of refugee status results in legal entitlement to residency in the State. If unsuccessful, the issue of residency falls to be considered in the context of a proposal to make a deportation order.In relation to asylum applications, the Government's asylum strategy envisages that such applications should be processed within a six-month timescale. Significant progress continues to be made in relation to the processing of asylum applications, which is evidenced by the fact that the number of cases which are over six months old in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT, was in the region of 1,800 at end May 2003 as compared with a figure of 6,500 approximately at end September 2001. The vast majority of these applications are in the final stages of processing. The ORAC is now scheduling for interview in June 2003 some applications made in March 2003.

This represents an increase of 105 in the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 6 June, 2002. I strongly support specialised and focused Garda operations, such as Operation Encounter, to counter late night disorder and I remain determined that the resources of the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system in general are used effectively to combat street crime.

However, with many prisons operating at or near full capacity, some accommodation difficulties occur from time to time. It should be noted that this issue is not simply one of matching the global prisoner population to a global figure for beds or cells. A number of factors have to be taken into account including the prisoner's age, gender, the nature of the offence, location, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced.The Government is committed in its agreed programme to complete the modernisation of prisons and to the provision of extra places so as to avoid overcrowding and the reopening of the revolving door.

Nevertheless, prisoners may still be considered for temporary release in certain circumstances, for example, release under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service, on compassionate release because of ill health or family related circumstances, or because they are nearing the end of their sentences.I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the information requested is not readily available. However, the Director General will arrange for the figures requested to be forwarded directly to the Deputy once they have been compiled. On a general note though, I can inform the Deputy that the overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has been reduced from a figure of 19% in 1997 to a current daily figure of about 8% of the total prison population.

Responsibility for funding capital works to Garda premises is, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, a matter for the Office of Public Works.Resources available to the gardaí are continually reviewed to take account of current requirements. Funding for the gardaí has increased significantly in recent years. For example, in the area of information technology systems, approximately €21 million was allocated in 2003, an increase of approximately €5 million on 2002.

The Act has two main objectives. Firstly, it targets the child sex tourist by providing that Irish citizens or persons ordinarily resident here who engage in sex with children abroad can be dealt with by Irish courts. Secondly, the Act also targets organisers by making it an offence to arrange transport for, or to actually transport, child sex tourists. It is also an offence to publish information on child sex tourism.The Act gives the Garda Síochána substantial powers to deal with this evil. If experience shows that additional powers are needed I will not hesitate to seek Government approval for them.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	678	Section 75 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that a local authority may enter arrangements for the twinning of its administrative area or a part of it with any other area outside the State. The decision to enter such an arrangement is a reserved function. The purpose of twinning includes the promotion of tourism, industrial development, cultural exchanges, fostering of understanding and co-operation between countries and the implementation of joint projects.Twinning arrangements are made by the local authorities involved and my Department has no role in the process. I understand that European Union funded town twinning, under the community action for town twinning programme, is facilitated by the Institute of Public Administration.

The preliminary report, received from Sligo County Council in April 2002, has been under examination in my Department and I understand a letter will issue shortly to the County Council requesting additional information to assist in finalising this examination. The timescale for examination of such proposals is dictated by the competing demands placed on my Department's technical staff and the scheduling of individual schemes within the overall water services investment programme.

The maximum level of rent which a person may incur is determined by each health board and is set by reference to household composition and local property rental prices.The South-Western Area Health Board has advised that the rent being sought in this case is €205 per week which is almost twice the relevant rent limit for a single person, normally €107 per week. The person was given the opportunity to provide evidence of any exceptional circumstances which ought to be considered by the board. In light of the information provided, the board determined that the circumstances of the case were not such as to warrant payment of the rent being sought. The person concerned has been advised that he should secure more reasonably priced accommodation to qualify for a rent supplement.
