#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is proposed to take No. 1a, Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007 [Seanad] — Second and Subsequent Stages.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Second and Subsequent Stages of No. 1a shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m.; (ii) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and (2) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 September 2007.

As this is the last day before the summer recess, the Government is in a position to provide additional time to properly address the very important matters arising from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007.  As other Deputies pointed out, legal and potential constitutional issues arise from the legislation.  While the list of amendments is not large, nevertheless there is a critical need to give each Stage the full scrutiny and attention it deserves.  Accordingly, I oppose the imposition of a guillotine and appeal to the Minister to extend the time available for the debate to allow it to be completed naturally, today if that is the Government's wish.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	7	In respect of the time allocation for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007, given that this is a short Bill, the House needs more time to debate Committee Stage than to debate Second Stage.  The structure of the Second Stage debate does not facilitate discussion of conflicting opinions as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the legislation.  I suspect Opposition Deputies will simply repeat each other and the Minister will respond only once.  I propose, therefore, that debate on Committee Stage will commence at 1 p.m. rather than 2.30 p.m. because the meat of the Bill is in Committee Stage and serious concerns arise about its constitutionality.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I have no problem accepting Deputy Quinn's proposed amendment to the Order of Business.

Is the proposal that the Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 September 2007 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	10	This will not be the usual rant.  I propose that the Dáil sit on 11 September on the grounds that committees are not established before the House goes into recess for 12 weeks and a great deal of parliamentary work could be undertaken.  I regret it has not been possible for committees of the House to perform their functions in July and the early weeks of September.  I propose, therefore, that the House sit again on 11 September.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I second Deputy Kenny's proposal.  I do not propose to discuss in detail the reasons sittings should resume earlier than proposed as they are obvious and best set out by Deputy Sargent in column 1208 of the Official Report of 6 July 2006.  I fully support everything the Deputy said at the time.I regret the House will rise without appointing committees.  It is further evidence of the disrespect shown to the House and the rights of the Opposition.  Yesterday, for example, the Taoiseach absented himself on one of the rare opportunities to be accountable in the House.  The conference of trade unions lasted for four days, during which the Taoiseach would have been accommodated at any time, but he chose to attend at a time that coincided with Leaders' Questions.  He would not attend to take parliamentary questions or the Order of Business but he managed to get back to pose for photographs with candidates for the Seanad.  I hope when we begin business in earnest in the autumn that we will see a bit more respect for this House and the Opposition.

While looking forward to the summer recess and the holiday opportunities as much as any Member of the House, there is every justification for an earlier return.  We are on the last day of this sitting with no Government programme published.  Despite what the Tánaiste said yesterday, the Government will hold the programme until we have all left and the earliest opportunity to address it in a real and careful way will be deferred until the end of September.  The earlier return in order to examine exactly what the Government proposes to do, and not to be dependent on any one party's presentation of that, is in the interest not only of this House but of the roles and responsibilities entrusted to us.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Given the timing of the election in 1997 and 2002, it was not possible to constitute committees before the Dáil rose for the summer recess on those occasions either.  I am not in a position to take amendments to the Order of Business in respect of our return.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I listened this morning to the comforting tones of the Minister for Defence.  It is great to know that the Irish people are safe from terrorist attacks after his pronouncements.On a serious note, as the Dáil will not sit again for 12 weeks and there is concern about this matter, will the Government make arrangements for the leaders of the Opposition parties to receive a briefing on aspects of terrorist threats, however high or low they might be?In 2002, the then Attorney General, Michael McDowell, raised the issue of non-consultation with his party about certain State appointments and a structure was put in place apparently to deal with that problem.  Will the Tánaiste confirm whether Mr. Joe Burke has been appointed chairman of Dublin Port and, if so, were the structures put in place in 2002 followed in this case?  Was there consultation with the Progressive Democrats group and the Green Party?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Ceann Comhairle was at the Cabinet table in 2002 when the matter was first raised.  I am not asking him to breach Cabinet confidentiality but maybe from his legal background he contributed to that structure being put in place.  Will the Tánaiste tell me whether that structure was followed in this case and was there consultation with the other members of the Government?  Will he confirm that Mr. Burke is the chairman of Dublin Port?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I wish to draw attention again to the Cabinet handbook which, as I pointed out earlier in the week, has already been breached in another respect.  The handbook states:All Government and Ministerial appointments should be published in Iris Oifigiúil as soon as can be arranged following the appointment. The Government Secretariat will arrange for publication of appointments made by the Government.There have been several appointments since 24 June, not just the one to which Deputy Kenny referred, and they have not been published in Iris Oifigiúil.  The Ceann Comhairle might demonstrate some laxity and ask the Tánaiste to confirm why — if it is true that the Taoiseach’s very best friend has been reappointed — this did not go to Cabinet.  I thought all these appointments had to go to Cabinet.I saw last night that no less a colleague than Deputy O'Rourke congratulated the Green Party because Fianna Fáil is pleased that it does not speak out any more.  Could it speak out on——

We all thought he meant Christmas 2006 but clearly we were wrong.  I ask the Tánaiste when the Bill will be published.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I expect the Dublin transport authority Bill to be brought to Government, and some decisions to be taken on it, before we return for the next session.

The Bill is designed to clarify and update the provisions relating to eligibility for health services.  Will the Bill be published before the resumption in September?Given the Taoiseach's grossly insensitive remarks yesterday and the need to counteract the negative impression they created, will the Government place a renewed emphasis on the rights and entitlements of those who suffer from mental illness and those who are at risk of suicide?  Will the Bill be brought forward so that we can address the needs and rights of those at risk and all those who use our health services?

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I have a letter, which I only received last night, too late to bring up on Committee Stage of the Roads Bill 2007, in which the Taoiseach gives a commitment, three weeks before the general election, to introduce mandatory drug testing at the scene of an accident if Fianna Fáil was re-elected to power.  In light of this new information, of which the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, was not aware, when will the proposed legislation come through?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It has not been promised in the House but the Government will look at all these matters in the context of trying to ensure we do everything possible to make our roads safer and to ensure people discharge their responsibilities adequately.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	54	On Tuesday the Taoiseach suggested that amendments to the Competition Authority Act 2002 would be needed in order to retain the right of workers in self-assessment to be in a trade union, to be represented and to collective bargaining for those who had negotiating licences.  He gave the impression this had been solved.  In view of his meeting with the social partners, is he still of that opinion or will we have amending legislation to ensure such workers will have the right to be represented and negotiated for by their trade union?On Wednesday I raised the question of whether changed procedures were envisaged for the drafting of legislation so that, in the autumn, we would not get a virtual proposed programme of legislation but one in which Bills would be in a position to be brought before the House.  I have not heard from the Office of the Taoiseach on either of these matters.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Competition Authority is an independent body and I am not aware of any legislation promised in this area.  It is true, however, that the question of preventing abuse of agency workers was raised at the meeting of the social partners.  That will be dealt with under an agency Bill which will be considered in due course.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I am aware of that legislation but refer to legislation on foot of a High Court undertaking sought by the Competition Authority from SIPTU that equity members, who work for several different employers and are on self-assessment, would not be represented by their union, SIPTU.  The union officer would be sent to jail if he or she represented, for example, the actors involved in making advertisements.I prepared Private Members' legislation on this matter but that is where it lies.  I understood it was raised at the meeting of the social partners and the Taoiseach said we would, if necessary, go back to it because it involved contravention of an ILO regulation and undermined the trade union representation, among other things.  One would have thought the brothers and sisters at their meeting with the Taoiseach yesterday would be in a position to know whether their friend, the Taoiseach, intended to legislate on this matter or not.  It is as simple as that.  I have Private Members' legislation which I will be glad to reintroduce to the Dáil to seek the support of all elements of Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I am informed by the Minister that there are no plans to change the Competition Act 2002.  Discussions took place in respect of the other issue, and are ongoing among the Minister, the Department and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.On the question of the list of legislation, obviously we hope it will be an accurate reflection of what will come on stream in our coming term.  It will be promulgated when it is ready.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19835	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I see from the programme for Government that the Government is proposing the establishment of a national transmission company.  It also states it is totally opposed to nuclear power.  Since the Government programme was published the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has indicated he would welcome a debate on the introduction of nuclear power.  Can I have clarity as to the Government's position?  Is it the one set out in the programme for Government or is it the alternative one as articulated by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	59	That issue does not arise now.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19835	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	60	It does arise.  There is a long tradition whereby we have the right to raise issues relating to promises set out in the programme for Government which involve legislation, in advance of the programme for legislation, which the Government has yet to produce.  These matters involve legislation and I am perfectly entitled to ask the question.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Legislation relating to the national transmission company will probably be brought forward during the course of next year.  I do not accept for a moment that what the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, said on a debate on energy policy, including the options for nuclear energy, is in any way at variance with the commitments in the programme for Government.  I had not finished my answer but I will stop if the Deputy wants to interrupt.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19835	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The programme for Government says the Government strongly believes that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor an answer to Ireland's energy needs.  That statement was only published one month ago, but the Minister with responsibility for energy is now articulating a different view.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The issue before us, which requires the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 to be amended, centres on the activity following the PIAB making a formal award.  While PIAB awards mirror court awards, as both have regard to a book of quantum to determine the appropriate award to be given, some claimants choose to reject the award and commence litigation proceedings in the hope of receiving greater compensation.  It is their right to choose this course of action and this Bill in no way interferes with that right.  However, as these proceedings advance, some claimants are accepting the same amount as the PIAB award but are also recovering legal costs and additional costs of up to €1,500 to cover the cost of engaging a solicitor to assist with the original PIAB claim.  The proceedings were therefore unnecessary for the claimant to receive the same level of award.This development completely undermines the rationale and the positive impact of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  By any standards, a charge of €1,500 to assist in filling a form is exorbitant, uncompetitive and unsustainable.  The PIAB offers an independent and impartial monetary assessment of damages based on medical evidence, in a non-adversarial document based system and without the need for an oral hearing.  Claimants can be assured that the amount of damages reflects what is awarded in the courts.  It is a matter for each claimant to either accept or reject this fair and impartial assessment.  If they decide to reject this assessment and enter the litigation route, they need to be aware there are risks regarding legal costs.  There is no intention in this amendment to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 to interfere with claimants' rights of access to the courts.  However, the Bill is entirely consistent with the objectives of the principal Act to prohibit, in the interests of the common good, the bringing of unnecessary legal proceedings.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 and this Bill are definitively pro-consumer, in as much as they highlight the cost risks in taking legal proceedings and contribute to lower insurance costs.If the situation is allowed to continue, the consequences will be far-reaching.  The cost burden will fall on the consumer and business.  We must not forget that it is only a few years since businesses were being squeezed out of existence because of the spiralling costs of insurance.  This was an unhappy situation and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has done a great deal to address it.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business made the following recommendation in its third interim report on reforms to the insurance market: "Where, not having accepted a PIAB award, the court award is equal to or less than a PIAB award, legal costs should not be allowed to the claimant."  The Bill implements this recommendation.The purpose of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007 is to provide that in certain circumstances, where a claimant rejects a PIAB assessment that has been accepted by a respondent and where he or she fails in any subsequent proceedings to get more than the amount of the PIAB assessment, he or she will not be entitled to legal costs.  Section 1 of the Bill provides that two new sections are added to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 as follows.  A new section 51A provides that where a claimant rejects a PIAB assessment that has been accepted by a respondent and where the claimant fails in any subsequent proceedings to get more than the amount of the PIAB assessment, he or she will not be entitled to legal costs. A new section 51B provides that no legal costs shall be allowed for the making of an application to the PIAB.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the citation of the new Act.The PIAB was established in April 2004 as part of the Government's insurance reform programme, with the aim of allowing certain classes of personal injury claim, where liability is uncontested, to be settled without the need for the costs associated with litigation. The threat of rising insurance costs at the time posed serious risks to Irish business and the economy generally.  Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, claimants are obliged to submit claims to the PIAB.  They may submit their claims directly or they may employ a solicitor at their own cost, which is something similar to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.Since its establishment, the PIAB has successfully fulfilled its legal obligations and is now assessing claims three times faster and four times cheaper than under the old litigation system.  By the end of May 2007, the PIAB had made actual savings of more than €45 million on awards totalling €115 million, when compared with the old, unwieldy, adversarial and litigation-based system.  This is quite an achievement in such a short space of time and can only be good news for accident victims, business and consumers generally, who have seen big reductions in insurance premiums.In addition to the provision of these savings, the PIAB has succeeded in establishing a new non-adversarial culture of settling claims.  It has put paid to the long wait for compensation and the adversarial approach to the process that previously led to huge uncertainty and stress for claimants.  Within a few years the old system has been replaced by a speedy, low cost, user-friendly system.  In 2005, personal injury cases going through the courts system dropped from over 35,000 cases in 2004 to less than 5,000.  The effects are felt throughout the court system where valuable time has been freed up to deal with cases that should more properly reside there.The PIAB is a new body that has significantly changed the environment for making personal injuries claims, and is the subject of regular challenge.  I am aware of these challenges, and the Government will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the board is not undermined in its ongoing work.It is projected by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board that an absence of corrective legislation has the potential to lead to the rejection of almost all PIAB assessments which will subsequently proceed to litigation for the sole purpose of securing costs.  The Bill addresses the issues I have described to ensure the stated Government policy of streamlining the settlement of personal injury claims is not permitted to be circumvented in the manner currently evidenced.I emphasise to the House that this Bill will in no way limit claimants' range of choices or access to the courts.  The current amendment is a short technical proposal designed to address a significant risk to the intent of the Act.  With this in mind the co-operation of Deputies in assisting the smooth passage of the Bill through this House would be greatly appreciated.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Fine Gael supported the setting up of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board but we cannot support this Bill.  It was the Fine Gael Party that first called for a mechanism to be put in place that would lead to reduced charging by the various intermediaries that were in place in order to speed up the processing of those claims in a less costly manner.  Ultimately, we got the Government to act but a legal and perhaps constitutional principal is being trampled on here.As has been spelt out, the purpose of the Bill is to provide for a situation where a claimant rejects a PIAB assessment that has been offered and where they fail to win more than the amount offered by the board when they go to the courts.  I understand the logic behind that.  Nobody wants to encourage frivolous claims.  We co-operated with the House on the Civil Liability Bill when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought that Bill forward in 2005 to deal with some of the exaggerated claims.  Nobody wants to tie up the time of the courts unnecessarily or add to the costs incurred by businesses and employers.  This Bill, however, is a serious step in terms of the rights of citizens, aiming as it does to restrict through discouragement the exercising of the legitimate democratic and legal rights of citizens.I want to quote directly from representatives of the Government at the time of the passing of the original legislation in 2003.  It is in the context of that debate, and the undertakings Ministers gave at the time, that we raise some objections today.  The then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, on Second Stage in the Seanad stated:"I am convinced the introduction of the PIAB, as well as the other reform initiatives being undertaken by the Government, will lead to a properly functioning market that will attract new entrants into the market and provide the much needed competition to drive premia down further".There have been no new entrants into the market.  While premiums could always be lower, the PIAB has done great work in helping to reduce costs but where is the evidence that people going to the courts are doing otherwise?The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, the then Minister for State in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at the end of that debate, stated:The PIAB is not designed to deny people's access to the courts nor their entitlement to seek independent legal advice.  The priority for the PIAB will be to implement fair procedures in accordance with the principles of natural justice as they apply in this "documents only" procedure.He went on to state: "At the end of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process, the parties are entitled to reject the award if they consider they would secure a more favourable outcome through the courts system".  Why has there been a U-turn on that?We were told also during the course of that legislation that the legal advice from the Attorney General to the Government would ensure there would not be any necessity to have a client take a case to the courts in respect of getting their costs restored if they used the services of a solicitor or a barrister for the purpose of presenting their case to the PIAB.  The whole idea behind the setting up of the PIAB was to ensure the legal people and all of the other people would not be necessary.  In other words, the process would be so simple, people would not need the help of a solicitor to draw up an application to the PIAB.  That did not happen because in the O'Brien case Mr. Justice MacMenamin ruled that access to justice for the citizen was important and that what the Government had tried to do, despite the legal advice and assurances we got, was to take away the rights of the citizen to go to the courts, in denial of what the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, had said in the course of the conclusion of that debate.Another Minister made a contribution at that time.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Frank Fahey, in the Dáil debate, stated:It has also been alleged that respondents will consent to a case going to assessment with the full intention from the outset of rejecting the award and fighting liability in court.  This makes no financial or tactical sense.  Why would a respondent waste fees on the PIAB and then incur litigation costs?  Delaying a case never operates to the advantage of the respondent but always enhances the value of the claim with the passage of time, which hampers rehabilitation.That is what we are arguing today.  There is no incentive for anyone trying to play the system to go to the PIAB with the intention of taking a frivolous claim to the courts.  Only when there is a legitimate concern at the decision reached by the board would a decision to proceed to the courts follow.It should not be forgotten that in its rush to tackle the little guy the Government is ignoring the massive profit increases for insurance companies since the introduction of the PIAB.  We were told the savings the PIAB would accrue would be passed on to consumers.  That was the rationale behind this Bill being introduced and the co-operation of the Opposition on that in terms of the benefit to the consumer.  In 2005, the profits of insurance companies amounted to €418 million, an increase of 26% on the previous year, while the savings that have accrued from the PIAB amounted to 1.8%.  The various savings from the PIAB are going into the hands of insurance companies rather than to the consumer.Britain has seen the bonanza profits made as a result of the changes to the claims regime in Ireland and is begging the Government there to follow suit.While I am on the subject of the big guy versus the little guy, I need not remind the Minister of a case that has been brought to my attention.  It involves a 78 year old widow from Limerick who was offered €14,000 from the PIAB in an action she took against Bus Éireann in 2004.  Bus Éireann fought the case and she went to court where she spent a day and a half in the witness box.  The court awarded her €40,000.  If we enact this legislation that lady will get €14,000 in a similar case.  She will not have the prospect of going to court to get €40,000.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The Minister gave us all these assurances when the Bill was going through the House in 2003 but they did not turn out to be true, in spite of the advice we gave the then Minister, Deputy Harney, at the time but she knew best.For our part, we supported the establishment of the PIAB but laid down some important markers at the time.  We made the point that Article 34 of the Constitution prescribes that justice must be administered in courts established by law, by judges appointed under the Constitution, and in general must be administered in public.  There are specific provisions in law which allow the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature other than by judges.  It is clear, however, that the exercise of such powers must be in accord with the principles of natural justice and in accordance with fair procedures.In the original legislation, injured claimants are obliged by law to present their claims to this board, which will operate in secret and which will, effectively, deny them the right of independent advice, assistance or representation.  Despite those concerns, we favoured the Bill.We are not alone in our view.  I point to the remarks of the late Mr. Justice Seán O'Leary, who did the State some service.  He set down his thoughts on the administration of justice prior to his death, which were published following his death.  He stated the culture that has grown around the operation of the PIAB is one where all claimants for personal injury are viewed as fraudsters.  He went on to state: "The culture so created has been added to by the aggressive advertising of the insurance lobby".  He further stated:Much more needs to be done to restore an appropriate balance.  If this is not done by the Oireachtas, then, in my view, the courts must insist on appropriate protection when suitable cases are presented for adjudication.Those are the views of an eminent judge who had the respect of Members on all sides of the House and who made posthumous remarks about the operation of the principles of natural justice.Today's debate gives us an opportunity to review where we are in terms of natural justice and fair procedure.  I ask the Minister to reconsider whether it is appropriate that the State should seek to discourage people exercising their legal rights.  I ask him also to review the operations of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board after three years in operation, which was promised by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, to determine if it is efficiently dealing with claims.  Why are the benefits accruing from the savings being made by the PIAB, amounting to €45 million, not going into the hands of consumers rather than into the hands of grossly profitable insurance companies?

This amendment Bill is simply anti-citizen and anti-consumer, contrary to what the Minister stated.The Bill constitutes an assault on the most fundamental principle of our democracy and our Constitution, that is, the principle of freedom of citizens to their entitlement to be treated fairly before the law.  The Constitution protects that right, inherently and in a variety of Articles, and this Bill acts as an assault on that.It is simply alarming that this legislation, which is aimed at attacking that freedom of equality before the law and equality of representation, is being pushed through by this Government in a style that is redolent of the Politburo in Soviet Russia.  Allow me to highlight some of the tactics that have been applied.  There has been no public consultation on this Bill, there has been no public debate on it, there was no reference in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to this legislation, there is no reference to it in the programme for Government and the Minister is now proposing to rush it through the House as though it were emergency legislation, which it clearly is not.

If this Bill is passed, it will more than likely be enacted within two weeks.The Bill aims at narrowing the options available to members of the public who are seeking justice and proper recompense before the courts when they have been wronged.  These people are not wrongdoers.  They are innocent victims who have been subjected to some form of personal injury but it seems that the Government now wants to punish them.They are consumers.  The Minister repeatedly referred to the rights of consumers but he is totally ignoring their rights in this Bill.  It is his duty to protect them, but he is attacking them by railroading this legislation through the House.The effect of the legislation will be to blackmail people away from their legitimate right to recourse to the courts.  That right should be sacrosanct and, indeed, is sacrosanct in the Constitution, and the Minister will tip the balance in favour of wealthy insurance companies and away from the rights of consumers and claimants in legitimate personal injury cases.This crucial legislation is being rushed through the Dáil as though it were emergency legislation, which it is not.  I want the Minister to tell the House what is the urgency to amend the Bill enacted only in 2003.  What is this urgency to amend such new legislation?  Why not review the operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board?  Why railroad through this ill-conceived amendment Bill?The constitutionality of the proposals in this Bill really is the crux of the issue.  I have major concerns about aspects of its constitutionality.  It has been brought to my attention that the legal opinion of probably the most eminent senior counsel in the country in the past few days was furnished to both the Minister and the Attorney General and I want to know what the Minister is doing with that legal opinion.  Will he take it on board or will he merely cast it aside and ignore it?There are two specific provisions in this Bill which constitute the essence of what is unconstitutional.  First, section 51B(2) is blatantly unconstitutional in that it imposes a blanket ban in all circumstances on the recovery of costs in subsequent litigation conducted by a solicitor in respect of work done during the course of the PIAB process.  That, in effect, is what the Minister proposes.A raft of case law has consistently held that the right to recover costs is an inherent aspect of the right to access to the courts under Article 34.1 and Article 40.3.1° of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Cases such as Heaney v. Ireland and Murphy v. Greene have set out in great detail learned judgments — if the Minister is unfamiliar with our constitutional law, I would be happy to explain it in further detail to him — not to mention the O’Brien v. PIAB decision in 2005 which challenged and defeated the Government’s attempt to quell people’s opportunity and right to legal representation through the PIAB process.In addition, section 51B(1) is unconstitutional because it is retroactive.  If the Minister's legislation is passed, people who are currently going through the PIAB process will not be able to claim their legal costs for that process which is totally unjust and unfair.The Minister can chooses to ignore the clear legal facts here at his peril.  It would be remiss and arrogant of him to ignore the constitutional issues here.  As the Minister will be well aware, of course such action is not unprecedented.  Last year virtually the same Government chose to ignore the constitutional lacuna in the statutory rape legislation, and we saw what happened there.  I would ask the Minister not to make the same mistake again.Fine Gael is asking the Minister to make a clear choice.  He should withdraw this legislation and come back to the Dáil in the next session when we can debate this properly and, hopefully, have an opportunity to vindicate the rights of citizens.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is disgraceful that this Bill is being rushed through in a way that reduces an opportunity for Members of this House to make a statement on the issue.  I have been five years out of this House and this place has changed.  Deputies' rights have been diluted to the extent that since we came back here two weeks ago almost every item of legislation has been guillotined.A Cheann Comhairle, as Chair of these proceedings, the manner in which the rights of Deputies elected from constituencies up and down this country are safeguarded does no credit to you.  I would hope that you would look at it during the summer, that the Government would look at the manner in which it treats this Chamber as a rubber stamp and that we might get off to a better start come the autumn.  We are not in the dying days of a Dáil.  We are at the start of a new five-year term.  This Bill is not urgent and it is wrong to push it through without giving adequate time for parliamentary debate and for public scrutiny and submissions.This is an attempt to push through a Bill that will limit the constitutional rights of citizens to take a personal injury case and it is nothing short of Government-sponsored blackmail.  Before empowering the insurance industry and the PIAB and before we should limit the rights of the citizen even further, there is a need on the part of Government to weed out unscrupulous practices within the insurance industry.Earlier this year a Sunday newspaper alleged that a major insurance company was recruiting serving and retired gardaí to investigate and settle claims to the detriment of the victim.  I will be returning to this in the autumn when we have time.  It is not unknown for accident victims to be visited at their hospital bedside by ex-gardaí acting as private investigators for large insurance companies and persuaded to settle their claims at gross undervalue.  To date there has been no serious effort, either on the part of the Garda or of the Government, to halt this practice.  Before he left this House the former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, stated that he viewed the matter as one of the utmost gravity.  I have not seen much action on the matter over the past few months.The citizens of this State are being left vulnerable to unscrupulous practices.  The idea of elderly accident victims being awoken in their hospital beds to be confronted by an ex-garda waving a claim form and an acceptance receipt is grotesque.  This Bill will copperfasten further the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to the detriment of the citizens of this country.  I heard a great deal of talk about consumers.  We are dealing here with the rights of citizens of the State to bring their cases fairly to an arbitrary proceeding, which is a court of this land.Newspaper investigations into alleged collusion between gardaí and the insurance industry reveal that privileged Garda information on road traffic accidents was used by insurance companies to settle cases more quickly and cheaply, and thereby contributed to a large rise in profits for the market share, a point made earlier by Deputy Hogan. According to the latest figures, motor insurance profits have risen to the tune of 25%.  There has been a decrease in premiums but this was cyclical and would have occurred in any event.  It should not be attributed to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Allianz Insurance reported a 16% increase in profits in its motor business but these savings have not been passed on to the citizen and the consumer.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been given further powers by the Government in such a way as to stack the odds in favour of the insurance industry, of which the PIAB is nothing more than a puppet.  The Government has strengthened its powers to limit an accident victim's capacity to seek compensation through the courts.  The Bill marks an erosion of people's rights and an attempt to muzzle the vulnerable and the voiceless.  This is not about fraudulent or frivolous claims but massive profits for the insurance industry on the backs of the victims of accidents.  Using the guillotine on the Bill makes a mockery of the parliamentary process, which is regrettable.

The Minister describes the PIAB as making an independent and impartial monetary assessment of damages based on medical evidence in a non-adversarial way.  It does not have a monopoly.  In a number of cases it made offers that were declined and the courts made significantly higher awards.The idea was to have the PIAB legal free but this is a misconception.  Insurance companies are stacked with legal opinion and the PIAB has significant legal knowledge.  The claimant is legal free, which is unfair.  The evidence does not stack up, given that 90% of those who make a claim through the PIAB have some legal knowledge or backup.The direction of the PIAB is a concern.  Deputy Flanagan referred to it becoming a puppet of the insurance industry.  It accepts that a wrong has been done and that the only matter to be agreed is the amount of damages to be paid.  It does not have a monopoly.  Speaking as an employer, the benefit of the current health and safety position of employers is as a result of claims made in the courts and the PIAB.  However, the profits of insurance companies have continued to rise dramatically, despite the existence of the PIAB.  Premiums have not been reduced to reflect the decrease in the cost of claims.The consumer does not benefit from the PIAB and will certainly not benefit from this amendment.  The proposal is designed to force claimants to make an assessment of what is offered without legal advice.  That is wrong and I am surprised it is proposed.  Now, if a case proceeds to court after undergoing a PIAB assessment and the courts do not award higher damages, the claimant must pay for legal opinion out of his or her own pocket.  These are strong arm tactics that benefit the PIAB.  Joe and Josephine Soap who we accept have suffered a wrong are not getting the benefit of legal advice.  They are playing Russian roulette with the court system.  To Deputies Flanagan, Creighton and Penrose who are professionals in the legal world, this is wrong.As an employer, I suggest this measure should not be taken.  Evidence suggests it may be unconstitutional.  If someone receives an increased amount from the court system, he or she does not have costs of the PIAB application covered.  How can the Minister support this?  The legislation is designed in order that people make a legal assessment without legal advice.  Insurance companies and the PIAB have legal advice, while Joe and Josephine Soap do not.  I refer to the final point in the Minister's speech, that the Bill will in no way limit claimant's range of choices or access to the courts.  That is incorrect.  The Bill will exclude people by using the fear that they will be left with a significant legal bill if they take a case to court.  That should not be the aim of the legislation.I have only been a Member for a number of weeks.  It seems the mighty are being facilitated to grow mightier.  There is nobody as mighty as the insurance companies.  The Bill will lead to increased profits and the ordinary citizen will not receive a just amount for the wrong done.  That is unjust.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I wish to share time with Deputies Penrose and Kathleen Lynch.I look forward to Committee Stage when we can engage in dialogue that was not characteristic of the publication and urgent debating of this Bill.  I support the concept of the PIAB and argued for it when I was Minister with responsibility for enterprise and employment.  I was persuaded of the necessity to reduce the costs of employment and insurance, both legal and premium costs, as they affected small business.  I remain convinced of the prevailing argument and believe the PIAB has contributed significantly in the case of 35,000 people out of 40,000 who could access a quick and easy settlement with minimum cost.  Some sections of the legal sector have had their personal injuries business significantly reduced and are hurting as a consequence.  However, the weak insurance market has not been reformed to the extent that there is now more competition.  As a result of changes in the marketplace, we have not seen the arrival of new elements that would drive down costs through competition.  There is an urgent need to review the operation of the system in place.For a short period I was a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, chaired by Senator Cassidy.  Representatives from the PIAB appeared before the committee and I am saddened that we have not had dialogue with them before passing all Stages today.I refer to the legal opinion received from Mr. Gerard Hogan, Ireland's most esteemed constitutional lawyer on these matters.  We tabled two amendments designed, in effect, to ensure this legislation would be constitutional and that there would be some residual discretion left to the courts in regard to these matters.  For a technical reason which I understand but think is nonsense, they were ruled out of order by the Chair on the grounds that they constituted a charge on the Exchequer.  If our amendment was passed, in some cases the court would be able to agree to award costs and that, consequently, would be a cost, ultimately, on the Exchequer.  I take it that it is possible for the Minister to introduce such amendments, should he consider they are worthy.  He might want to consider this as an option on Committee or Report Stage.What I do not wish to happen is for this legislation to be found unconstitutional.  It should be amended.  Deputy Charles Flanagan raised concerns in regard to the revelations about an insurance company using retired members of the Garda Síochána to informally access accident records within the Garda Síochána, which is an absolute abuse of privilege, an abuse of former servants of the State as well as data belonging to the State concerning citizens.  The matter should be vigorously investigated because it is one of concern.  While the article in question was written sensationally and the claim has been denied by the principal insurance company named in it, I am not satisfied we, as Members of the Dáil, have been satisfied that an undertaking and inspection have been carried through that refutes the claim in the article in the first instance, if such a refutation can be made, and more to the point, if it cannot be refuted, that effective action is being taken to stop this practice.We must examine the impact of the PIAB on how the insurance industry is working and how it is affecting our costs in terms of overall national competitiveness vis-à-vis other countries.  As the Minister has rightly stated on numerous occasions, we have to compete in a most competitive world and take responsibility for those costs and charges over which we have direct control.  This is a clear example of one of those costs.  Sometimes the intentions and interventions, well intended though they are by politicians, the Civil Service or the Minister of the day, have outcomes that were unanticipated or do not necessarily achieve the objective intended in the first place.I wish to read the conclusions of the opinion offered to the Minister and other Deputies in the House by Mr. Gerard Hogan.  I invite the Minister to give the advice he received in return, as no doubt he has received a response.  I will make this advice available.  The conclusion of the eminent senior counsel was:Summing up, therefore, I am of the opinion that:A. Judged by reference to the decision of Finlay P. in Henehan, section 51B(2) of the 2007 Bill is unconstitutional insofar as it imposes a blanket and artificial prohibition in all circumstances of the recovery of costs in subsequent litigation done by a solicitor in respect of work during the course of the PIAB process.B. Judged by reference to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Health (Amendment) Bill, section 51B(1) is unconstitutional insofar as it interferes retrospectively with the vested (albeit contingent) right of a claimant to recover the PIAB element of such costs in subsequent litigation.This is a serious charge from someone who commands respect across the House.  It would be rash and unwise of the House to rush through legislation which will, because there is no commencement date for it, upon signature by the President in three or four weeks time, take immediate effect and have an immediate effect on cases pending.  My colleague, Deputy Penrose, might address this matter in a more professional way as he is a practising lawyer.  There are legal difficulties associated with this issue.  Irrespective of the merits of the case, as Members of this House, as a constituent part of the Oireachtas, in line with the President, we have to be vigilant in ensuring we do not pass laws, however well intended, that will turn out to be unconstitutional and which will, undoubtedly, be challenged on foot of this opinion and by the legal profession.I thank the Minister for the copy of the opening statement he made available.  However, I am not satisfied he has made a compelling case as to why we need to do this now and so quickly.  It is not clear what are the additional costs.  We have not received a briefing from the PIAB in regard to the Bill, although I received brief correspondence from its chairperson in response to a press release I issued.  I am not satisfied this is the way we should be making this law.  We have the experience of this House which the Minister will remember in his previous ministerial responsibility when his successor tried to rush through legislation to make the payment of nursing home charges retrospectively legal and it was deemed to be unconstitutional.  We should learn from our collective experience.  This is not about point-scoring.  This is not a case of Fianna Fáil v. the rest.  This is not the cut and thrust of party politics; this is the workshop of democracy where we try to get laws on the Statute Book that will enable our society to function well.  We are not doing that job effectively.I urge the Minister to respond fully to the points that have been made and give a reason as to why all Stages of the Bill have to be enacted today and rushed through the Seanad in the next week or so.  What is the reason for this urgency if, as the Minister stated, 35,000 out 40,000 legal cases that previously went before the courts are happy to go to the PIAB?  It was never the intention that the access route to the courts would be shut off for all 40,000.  It was always the intention for those persons who felt they had a reasonable argument to go to court, should they want to have the complexities of their individual case argued in court, that that constitutional and legal door should be left open to them.  However, it was intended for others for whom there was no dispute in regard to the damage done and no dispute as to liability or responsibility who simply wanted to make their application, receive compensation and get on with the rest of their lives and did not want to wait in a legal queue for two or three years and that as a consequence, the legal element of the costs of insurance would be reduced for them in a simple and straightforward way.All of us welcomed that principle, in so far as we could see it functioning and it has functioned well for the 35,000.  Why are we closing off this door in this way to such an extent and in such an absolute manner when we have an opinion from an eminent lawyer to the effect that it is unconstitutional?  This is a reckless way to proceed.  I urge the Minister to reconsider.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I am a practising barrister; immediately therefore the PIAB and those associated with the insurance industry will say, "You would say that".  Notwithstanding the fact, some of those involved in the PIAB are closely associated with the insurance industry or had backgrounds in it.  That is their profession.  It is often the case when one is a legal person that there is a tendency to shoot the messenger because one may make points with which people are not happy.Let us be clear; I am here, not as a legal person but to represent my constituents, people who have rights that are being trammelled upon and curtailed.  They are not being shown respect, despite the fact that under the Constitution, they are entitled to have those rights vindicated.  A plethora of cases have indicated people have rights of access to the courts and that they are entitled to receive the best legal advice available to them.  If they win their case, because they have been the victim of an injury perpetrated by somebody who has done wrong, their costs should also be recovered.Like Deputy D'Arcy, I also have a business and pay insurance.  The premium has reduced to some extent but it is nowhere near the level of reduction that, according to the Minister, should be passed on to me as a consumer since the introduction of the PIAB.  The biggest beneficiary to date of its introduction has undoubtedly been the insurance companies and the insurance industry.  The cost of insurance has come down but the magnitude of the decrease, some of which would have happened, is dwarfed by the significant increase in the profits of insurance companies.  In 2005 the profits of the motor insurance industry increased by 26% to €480 million.This figure comes from a report by the Financial Regulator.  Overall, insurance companies made a net underwriting profit of €802 million in 2005.  This figure only pertains to the Irish risk business and represents a 16% increase on the €689 million achieved in 2004.  This gives the lie to any displays of the poor mouth from such sources up to now.  Profits have continued to increase in 2006 and I would like to see those figures.It is clear the major winner from the introduction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was the insurance industry.  Is that a coincidence, simply pure good fortune or would this have happened to some extent in any event?  The board has played a role.  However, it only handles uncontested cases and Members should understand that many such cases are contested.  Although some Members were of the view that one had a choice and was not obliged to go through the board, one must do so.  Moreover, it is obligatory to go through PIAB even when one has a case against the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, which was set up by the Oireachtas in a parallel measure.  In such cases, it is passed back and subsequently the entire process begins again.While the Personal Injuries Assessment Board offers assistance to people to try to get them into the system, the important point is that one must get some advice before going through the board.  Not everyone can read the plethora of complex forms that come to them.  Mr. Justice John MacMenamin's judgment in the O'Brien case is very interesting.  He went to great lengths to spell out the reasons and cited various cases from America and elsewhere.  Every other jurisdiction recognises that legal representation involves conduct as well as advocacy.  However, the Minister's actions today will ensure they are wiped out.No one who is involved in any way in a legal profession is able to offer any criticism of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board because we are deemed to be vested interests.  Others however, including those with senior jobs in other fields involved in the insurance industry, can say what they like or put forward any view without being deemed to be vested interests.  There is no point considering matters through rose tinted glasses that are coloured by whatever background from which one comes.  It is important that people's rights are not simply trampled upon.Insurance companies have not passed on the moneys saved to their customers.  I wish to acknowledge the work of Pat Leahy of The Sunday Business Post who has conducted a critical analysis of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which was not the most popular thing to do.  I understand that Dearbhail McDonald, the legal correspondent for the Irish Independent, has also done so.  In an interview with The Sunday Business Post on 5 November 2006, the chief executive of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board stated “It’s not my job to criticise the insurance companies” and she refused to comment on the level of premiums charged.  While she may believe it is not her job, the PIAB criticises everything else.  Incidentally, I was holding a clinic one day when I overheard an avalanche of Personal Injuries Assessment Board people coming on air to criticise and take issue with everything she said.Members should consider the facts.  How many of the claimants, of those who have filled forms with the board, have had their cases proceeded with and have accepted the awards?  While the Minister has cited a figure of 35,000, the duty of lawyers is to act in the best interests of their clients.  Everyone, including IBEC and the insurance industry, is claiming we are all one big happy family.  I have always taken the view that when everyone is pronouncing that we are all winners, someone must be losing.  It is clear the losers are ordinary claimants and consumers.  While the ultimate aim is a lawyer-free zone and there is nothing wrong with that, not everyone is able to understand the intricacies and complexities that exist.  Clearly this is a one-sided equation as the insurance companies can arm themselves with the best lawyers and claims managers.  Such individuals are very good at their job and I salute them for that.  They can be as tough as nails.  However, as Deputy Flanagan asked, what about the little person?  Undoubtedly, the system will gain a fresh impetus after the passage of this Bill.  Basically, it is so designed to compel accident victims to accept settlements that may be significantly lower than their true value.  A fear will be generated that were one to reject an offer of €25,000 and proceed to court, where one was awarded €24,999, one would lose both one's own costs and those of the defendants.  Although this constitutes a double whammy, the system is supposed to be fair.The Minister should recall the Bill.  I had always considered him to be a middle of the road or centre-left politician, unlike some of his colleagues and have always believed that he would consider matters from a broad perspective.  I am surprised he has presented this Bill to the House in a rushed manner.  Is there any control of the insurance industry under any circumstances?Recently, I read that insurance companies are offering parents money for injuries sustained by their children.  In other words, they are settling children's claims directly with parents.  I am unsure of the truth of this report.  For good reason, the Civil Liability and Courts Act and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act have in-built statutory safeguards to protect the rights of children.  All such offers of settlement to a solicitor or parent of a child under 18 years of age must remain just that, namely, offers until they are approved by the court of competent jurisdiction.  A time-honoured process exists for enabling the court to adjudicate upon the adequacy or otherwise of the offer.  Of course to invoke such vital safeguards, the claim must have been initiated, that is, legal proceedings must be issued or a claim made through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  When the court is not satisfied, the case will proceed to a hearing before a different judge and any amount ultimately approved or awarded by the court will then go into the Courts Service, to be managed until the child in 18.  I have read about such developments.  It would be a serious matter if an insurance company could settle such claims directly.Deputy Flanagan mentioned a scenario about which I have concerns, namely, when someone is injured.  Someone could come to one's hospital bed or home to make an offer within two or three weeks of an accident.  If it looks good, perhaps €15,000 or €20,000, one might decide to accept it.  At present, the incentive is to do so.  However, two years later one may be attending physiotherapists, be out of work with a bad back or be obliged to see an orthopaedic surgeon.  Where does it end?  This is a oneway road.  This is a genuine point as I no longer carry out as much work of this nature as heretofore, because I do not have time.This road is oneway.  I am disappointed with the trade union movement.  It represents workers in the industry and I have not heard a squeak out of them.  Workers are involved.  Why should it be that local authorities, big business and so on can have the best brains in the business representing them, while the Minister proposes that people should take the chance by going to court?  If one is awarded a cent less than one's offer, one is banjaxed.  This is what the Minister proposes and he is providing no discretion.I will not go into the opinion offered by Gerard Hogan.  As I told Deputy Quinn this morning, I was not aware of it.  However, I refer to the retrospectivity of this measure.  It cannot stand up and the Minister should withdraw sections 51B(1) and 51B(2).  The Minister proposes to implement a measure that is unconstitutional.I cherish a couple of things, namely, the Constitution and the independence of the Judiciary.  I am very proud of them and in that context, I urge the Minister to re-examine this Bill.

Civil servants write speeches for Ministers, but the least Ministers can do is ensure accuracy.  Insurance companies did not reduce their costs as a result of the PIAB's establishment.  Those costs had already fallen as a result of the intensive scrutiny of the industry by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  An issue on its agenda at the time was the establishment of the PIAB.I have no vested interest in this matter other than being a Deputy who represents people, the majority of whom would not be able to represent themselves in court or before the PIAB and who would be nervous about filling out the type of form required.  Throughout Committee Stage, we received assurances that one would always have the safety net of being able to go to court.

If we forget this, our democracy is in serious trouble.  The amending Bill to the legislation will try to remove that protection.  It will be challenged because it is constitutionally unsound.The PIAB's chairperson was impressive when it was established, but had I been the claims manager of Iarnród Éireann, I would also feel strongly about people taking that body to court.  Now, what I see are beggars on horseback.  The Minister knows as well as I the old saying in Cork about putting a beggar on horseback and being ridden to the devil.  This is what the amendment will do.  We got a pound of flesh, but it is not enough because we want two pounds.Someone may fall and be seriously injured.  It could happen through negligence.  I am a great believer in there being certain things as accidents and fault on both sides, but some people are injured through negligence on the part of the person with the duty of care.  In my example, the person would need to go to the PIAB, but the Minister assured us that one could bypass the PIAB and go directly to court.  The PIAB would decide that because of the person's circumstances and lifestyle — it is not a grand lifestyle and he or she does not have a lot of money or assets — €30,000 would be enough.  There is an attitude that a Gucci suit will get someone before the courts more than something from Dunnes Stores.As an offer of €30,000 would not be enough, the person would decide to go to court, but the first advice given to the person by those who know the law is that, if he or she goes to court, he or she may get a lesser award — it is the adviser's duty to inform the person of this — and become liable for costs.  What would a person with no means or assets do?  Would he or she continue in the hope of being brazen, then settle for half?  He or she would accept the €30,000 knowing in his or her heart of hearts that it would be wrong to do so.  It is like telling people to take their medicine or else they will be sent to hospital to have needles stuck in them.  Fear is being instilled in people who have no means or assets.The PIAB should not be chaired by someone with the chairperson's background.  The instinctive reaction that everyone is a fraudster is not correct.  Claims in respect of compensation for personal injuries had reduced regardless, but the screw is being tightened further.  The Minister knows it is unconstitutional and it is staggering that his officials are allowing him to proceed with it.  Who is pushing the amendment and on whose suggestion is it being made?I am not a solicitor, lawyer or so on.  My vested interest is in ensuring that people without means are protected, but this legislation does not protect them.  The Minister should examine the aggressive advertising by insurance companies making millions of euro in profit, not tighten the screws on people and put them in positions whereby they will not access the courts for fear they will lose the little they have.  The Minister should examine the amendment seriously and ask himself the questions each of us should ask ourselves, namely, who is pushing the amendment, what is the amendment's purpose and why is it wanted.

I congratulate too Deputy Michael Ahern on his appointment as a Minister of State at the same Department.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the people of Cork South-Central for giving me the honour and privilege of representing them in this House.I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007.  I do not have a background in the legal profession or the insurance industry, which is not intended as a slight to any Deputy with either background in the House.  Since the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in 2004, it has been a central element of the Government's insurance reform programme.  Its success in such a short period has been remarkable, but we have not given it enough credit for its work during this debate.  The number of personal injury cases going through the courts has dropped from more than 35,000 in 2004 to fewer than 5,000 in 2005.  This dramatic reduction has allowed more court resources to be used to deal with cases that must, by necessity, go through the judicial process.The majority of people who suffer a personal injury through the negligence of others want reasonable compensation in an efficient, timely and uncomplicated manner.  The judicial process is not the appropriate mechanism for dealing with the majority of such cases.  This debate should not be focused on the interests of the legal profession or the insurance industry.According to the Central Statistics Office, motor insurance premia fell by 34% between April 2003 and December 2006.  Other policy initiatives contributed to this improvement, but the establishment of the PIAB has played an important role in reducing insurance premia, including tangible financial benefits for individuals and businesses.  The introduction of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which includes penalties for giving false or misleading evidence in personal injury cases, has provided a significant deterrent to bogus claims.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Then why is this Bill being introduced?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The work of the PIAB has directly challenged the mindset of the compensation culture.  The independent assessment of personal injury cases carried out by the board is provided without the need for the majority of current litigation costs, such as solicitors', barristers' and experts' fees, associated with such claims.  These significant costs contributed to the high cost of insurance in Ireland for both consumers and the business community.The compensation awarded by the PIAB is not affected by the legal costs and experts' fees that add more than 46% on average to the cost of a claim.  The board has also reduced the amount of time it takes to finalise a compensation claim.  While it can take approximately three years to settle a claim under the court system, it generally takes nine months to settle a personal injury claim via the PIAB.The PIAB has recently announced that it has delivered total personal injury awards in excess of €100 million to date.  Having reached full flow activity this year, it expects to deliver compensation payments in excess of €100 million annually from 2008.  Critically, it has brought consistency to the treatment of personal injury cases.  We all know of cases where people were encouraged to take an action because of the outcome of a court case brought by another person in similar circumstances.  The consistent and even-handed evaluation of claims by the PIAB has ended the incentive for claimants to bring suspect claims in the hope of securing a perhaps undeserved bonanza in court.The work of the PIAB has not only benefited the victim of the personal injury but also the person or organisation alleged to be responsible.  According to the chief executive of the board, there is good news also for respondents — those paying for accidents — as the costs of processing claims through the PIAB continued to reduce and are currently up to 70% cheaper than litigation.  Based on trends to date and the achievement of full volume activity this year, the PIAB is targeting annual processing cost savings of €40 million relative to litigation from 2008.I have listened carefully to the debate on this legislation.  The fundamental point is that the Bill does not remove a person's right to reject a PIAB recommendation and take a personal injury case to court.  Equally, if a claimant's legal representative feels strongly enough that the case should be taken to court, that representative has the option to take the financial risk.  The bottom line is that after a decision is issued by the PIAB, the claimant will have to make a judgment call as to whether he or she wishes to take the matter to court.  Claimants will in general make that judgment call based on the advice of their legal representative who is perfectly free to offer to take the case on  a "no win no fee" basis.There may be proposals from the other side of the House that the court should be allowed a degree of discretion on the issue of costs in cases where it upholds a PIAB assessment and grants somebody an amount no greater than that of the PIAB in its decision.  However, we have seen in other situations, particularly in criminal law matters, where the Judiciary has been given a degree of latitude in regard to mandatory sentences, with the outcome being that the exception becomes the norm and the flexibility granted to the Judiciary is extended so far that the rule becomes meaningless.The result of adopting this Bill will be to strengthen the role of the PIAB and make people think more carefully and perhaps more sensibly before embarking on a costly and lengthy legal process where the outcome is uncertain.  I commend everyone involved in the PIAB for the outstanding work they have done thus far and wish them every success.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an tAire, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern.  I support this legislation.  Some of the Members who have spoken have legal backgrounds.  I have practised as a professional insurance broker for more than 30 years, working on behalf of insurance consumers.  It is my experience that insurance premia have increased consistently in that period due to insurance companies incurring major losses.  Companies frequently imposed across the board increases, for both private and business customers.  People may choose to ignore the statistics but they undoubtedly show that motor, public liability and employers' liability claims were consistent loss makes for insurance companies.  Those clients who had the misfortune to have claims paid out of their policies suffered a further penalty when their insurance company imposed a claims loading.Before the advent of the PIAB system, most claimants brought their claims to court.  It is my experience that it generally took three to five years for claims to be settled.  These delays caused great annoyance to genuine claimants.  Furthermore, those policyholders against whose policies the claim was made suffered an increased premium for the duration of the three to five years in which the claim was awaiting a court hearing.  The insurance companies made sure no-claims bonuses and so on were not paid to such persons.  There is no doubt that insurance brokers had great difficulty in trying to negotiate the loading imposed by insurers on these policyholders.One of the consistent problems for insurers in the pre-PIAB era was that the courts were inconsistent in granting awards for seemingly similar claims.  There was a general view that particular judges were more or less likely to award substantial amounts.  This was a factor in the apparently relentless annual increases in insurance premia.  Since the introduction of the PIAB system, there has been a major reduction in the number of claims and the amounts of payments.  There has also been great consistency in the amounts awarded for similar injuries.  In 2005, for example, the number of claims in the court system reduced from some 40,000 to fewer than 5,000.  This has allowed the courts to deal with genuine cases in a more expeditious manner.  Under the previous system claimants had to wait three to five years to have their cases settled and receive their money.  Notwithstanding these developments, I have not seen any poor solicitors or barristers.  On the contrary, they seem to be flourishing.  One can only wish them good luck as they play an important role.Before the advent of the PIAB, legal costs at 40% were payable on the settlement achieved by the claimant.  A person who received a settlement of €10,000, for instance, had to pay €4,000 to his or her legal representative.  The difficulty in this regard is that it was insurance consumers who paid these costs via increasing premia.  Insurance companies are not the Society of St. Vincent de Paul but in business to make profits.  When they lose money, the losses are passed on to all customers through increased premia, not just those unfortunate persons who have a claim against their policy.It is my experience that in the last three years insurance premia across the board have reduced by 50%.  This is a direct result of the PIAB system by which claims have been substantially reduced in numbers and costs.  There is now greater competition within the insurance industry which was open in the past to charges that a cartel was in operation.  Both private and commercial business clients have benefited from reduced premia.  I suggest to Deputies D'Arcy and Penrose that if their premia have not come down by 50%, they should consult a good insurance broker.Reverting to a situation where claimants were encouraged to go to court would undoubtedly lead to higher settlements and drive premia up.  This would not be in the best interests of insurance consumers, whether private citizens or businesses.  While insurers are currently making large profits, it would be a sad day if we reverted to the problems we faced in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when insurance premia were considerably higher due to a lack of competition.  This Bill will continue the policy of streamlining the settlement of personal injury claims in a non-adversarial manner and replacing the old system with a speedy, low cost and user friendly one.  I do not wish to suggest that claimants have no rights to go to solicitors because if their claims are genuine they should be able to take that course.  However, the provisions in this Bill are in the best interest of insurance customers.   I strongly urge Deputies to support this Bill.

Like a rogue elephant trampling all before it, the Government will force the legislation's passage through sheer weight of numbers, regardless of the legal and democratic rights of our citizens.  I am stunned that the Minister, despite all the advice available to him, has stood over a Bill that is constitutionally unsound.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Deputy is an old hand.  He does not get upset at interruptions.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.Surely it is realistic to expect the Government to produce watertight legislation that will not waste our time or leave the door open to constitutional challenge.  This is not to take from the work being carried out by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which was advocated and supported by Fine Gael, albeit with some reservations.  However, our support cannot be extended to this Bill.  It is unbelievable that any Government or its representatives would legislate to restrict the rights of its citizens to access the courts without regard for public consultation.  Speaking on the original debate on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in 2003, the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated: "The PIAB is not designed to deny people's access to the courts or to their entitlement to seek independent legal advice."   It appears, however, this Bill not only adversely affects the rights of citizens but it may also force the introduction of other legislation to review and revise the operations of the assessment board.  That would be the unfortunate result of the railroading of the legislation.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2007 seeks to curb a reported practice whereby a large percentage of claimants are rejecting PIAB assessments and taking their cases to court in the hope of securing larger settlements or awards.  According to The Irish Times, this amounts to a figure of 40%.  The route is made more attractive by media reports on claimants who were awarded legal costs.   The important words here are “curb” and “practice”.  The Government is seeking through legislative means to impose a blanket ban on the recovery of costs in any subsequent litigation conducted by a solicitor in respect of work carried out in the course of the PIAB process.  This is further compounded by section 51B(1) which interferes retrospectively with the right of a claimant to recover the PIAB element of costs in subsequent litigation.  So much for the Government commitment to allow people to access the courts.  The right of access to court is an inherent element of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and covers civil proceedings.  Peter Leach has observed in Taking a Case to the European Court of Human Rights that the effective exercise of this right may create other obligations on the State, such as the provision of legal aid in civil proceedings where legal representation is made compulsory for certain types of litigation or simply because of the complexity of the procedure or the particular case.The PlAB initially sought to minimise lawyer involvement in the new procedure by corresponding directly with claimants rather than their legal advisers.  This policy was tested in the High Court in the case of O'Brien v PIAB 2005 and it was held by Mr. Justice McMenamin that the board had no statutory authority to exclude an applicant’s legal adviser from the process.An article in the Sunday Business Post on 1 July 2007 noted that the process of settling claims has changed hugely since the advent of the PIAB and stated:"The new system was designed to help insurers reduce costs but an unfortunate by-product has been the way it has encouraged insurers to short-change consumers.  Few outside the legal profession decry PIAB's professed aim of creating a lawyer-free zone, but the system has given carte blanche to the insurance industry to get the unsuspecting victims to accept settlements that are considerably lower than their true value."In supporting the establishment of the PIAB, Fine Gael made the point that Article 34 of the Constitution prescribes that justice must be administered in courts established by law, by judges appointed under the constitution and in general must be administered in public.  Where is the care we should be giving to personal injury victims?  The Government has become so obsessed with reducing insurance premia that the rights of victims have simply been forgotten.  The denial of their constitutional rights is just another way of leaving the average citizen adrift without the necessary recourse to viable options.  Rather than rushing through this legislation, the Minister would be better advised to pause to consult the Attorney General because Fine Gael is tired of repeating that rushed and railroaded legislation is bad legislation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I thank Deputies for their contributions, in particular newly elected Deputies such as Deputies Creighton, Michael McGrath and Kennedy, whom I congratulate on their election.  I wish to make several general points before addressing the specific issues raised by Deputies.I am somewhat taken aback by the strong anti-PIAB sentiment expressed by the Opposition and in particular by Fine Gael Members, despite their efforts to mask it.  I regret the personalisation of some of the attacks in regard, for example, to the chairperson.  That should not be part of any debate in this House.  Furthermore, does anyone seriously think the Government's agenda is to trample on the fundamental rights of citizens?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Of course the Government does not have that agenda.  Our agenda is completely the opposite because we want to protect the common good, the ordinary citizen and, ultimately, the taxpayer, as well as make our economy and society more competitive, effective and efficient.That is what we are trying to achieve.  I find the Fine Gael position quite extraordinary.  It is clear we are in a post-election scenario and I invite the spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Hogan, to take down the Fine Gael website entitled rip-off republic because the party's stance here is not about protecting people from rip-offs.  It is the antithesis of what that party was doing for approximately 12 months before the election, attacking the Government about rip-off this and rip-off that.  The Deputy should take down the website because his party's stance here is not in the interests of the consumer.

That is, in essence, what has happened here.

I have no axe to grind with the legal profession but its opposition to the PIAB has been relentless and will continue to be so.  The legal profession will seek every opportunity to undermine the PIAB.  Let us be under no illusions about that and let us not be naive about it.  We are endeavouring here to close off loopholes that will be exploited to the detriment of the consumer, the ordinary citizen and the common good.  That is all we——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Of course we must do it within the terms of the Constitution.  I accept, by the way, the measured approach taken by Deputy Quinn.  I accept that his presentation this morning is consistent with his earlier positions, in terms of enterprise, and I understand his legitimate concerns about the constitutional framework.  The Deputy made a measured contribution and I will deal with the issues he raised later.Fundamentally, our objective is to close off a particular loophole.  Mention was made of the membership of the PIAB.  I accept what Deputy Penrose argued regarding the bona fides of the case but unfortunately he questioned the composition of the board and referred to members' allegiances and so forth.  We all know Senator Joe O'Toole, who is the vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  I have had many discussions with the Senator, whose qualities as a parliamentarian I value.  I also value his contribution to the PIAB.  The Senator is a nominee of ICTU.  He made it very clear in the Seanad that the matter before us today relates to a succinct and net issue, that is, costs that are being unnecessarily incurred when the Personal Injuries Assessment Board makes an award and, in some instances, the amount has been rejected by claimants represented by solicitors.  These costs comprise two categories.  First, an amount in the region of €1,500 being sought for the completion of a PIAB application form, which had led to the award.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	134	That is exactly our concern.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Second, a further amount in legal costs, adding another 46% on top of the compensation itself, where the majority of the cases do not proceed into a court and no additional amount in compensation is achieved on behalf of the injured party.  That is the net point here.What is available to the citizen?  In short, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, as Senator O'Toole pointed out, is open six days a week to assist claimants in completing their application forms at a nominal cost of €50 per case.  We simply cannot preside over a system where a charge of approximately €1,500 is being levied on the public by an intermediary for this same service.  We cannot preside over that and this legislation is designed to close off that opportunity and close off the loophole.

With respect to Deputy Hogan, I suggest his party colleague was a little over the top in terms of her description of my good self.With regard to the other members of the board of the PIAB, one represents the insurance federation, as Deputy Penrose pointed out.  Another is the chief executive of the national consumer agency.  There are two nominees from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one of whom is the aforementioned Senator O'Toole.  The consumer director of the Irish financial service regulatory authority, which protects the consumer, is also on the board, as are a number of other individuals with relevant expertise.  It is unfair to suggest that there is a bias towards the insurance industry on the board.  I do not accept that contention, as expressed by Deputy Penrose.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I wish to give Members details of a case which illustrates my point.  We must balance the points raised with the real situations which arise in practice, such as in a particular case that has already been processed.  In one leading case, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board made an assessment of €9,200, which was rejected by a claimant.  Immediately after rejecting the assessment, proceedings were issued and an offer was made for the same amount as had been assessed, plus €1.  That offer was accepted.  One would think that was the end of the matter but legal costs were added on, amounting to €6,120.  Included in that was a figure of €3,250 for the solicitor.  Those were only the costs for the claimant and they did not take account of the other costs to the defendant of defending the case.  This is the kind of situation that the original Act was specifically introduced to deal with.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	151	That can be dealt with by other means.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	152	That is the kind of situation which made insurance costs prohibitive in this country.  We do not want to go back on the progress that has been made to date.  That is what this amending Bill now rectifies.  It will not affect the claimant who has a genuine reason for getting more from the court than was assessed by the PIAB.Deputy Quinn raised the issue of the potential impact of not moving on this issue.  If allowed unchecked and if current practices continued, the financial impact could potentially be €75 million, given the number of cases on hand in 2007.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Does that figure relate to 40,000 or 5,000 cases?

Deputy Quinn raised the issue of impact and the figure of €75 million is based on a scenario where all the awards are rejected and cases proceeded with through the route identified.  There is a conservative estimate that an additional cost of 39% of the award, plus up to €1,500 per case could arise.  That is based on an average award of approximately €20,000.  We estimate an additional cost of €9,300 per case or a total of almost €75 million per annum, which would be passed on to consumers in higher premiums.With regard to legal matters, my Department takes on board serious legal opinion submitted to it.  This Bill was published on 25 April, before the last Dáil was adjourned.

Perhaps this is something the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will have to address.  I was somewhat taken aback because I get the feeling that there is an anti-PIAB sentiment emerging here.  Whether or not I am wrong about that I do not know.

I am prepared to take it on board and accept that there may be a need for greater dialogue with the proposed committee and with Members.  That is something we may have to pursue further.  People may say that the PIAB has nothing to do with anything and is not responsible for the fact that motor insurance premiums are now down to 1997 levels.  That is spectacular progress by any yardstick.  During a recent "Drivetime" programme, IBEC said that employers' personal injury liability is no longer as big an issue as it was.  Household premiums are down to 2001 levels.

Premia in that year were reduced by 1.8%, even though there was a 26% increase in profitability for such companies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	174	Before taking that point, I want to acknowledge the presence of Senator Cassidy in the Gallery.  Deputy Lynch already referred to the work of his committee in driving the insurance agenda and keeping on top of it.  Deputy Hogan was a member of that committee, which recommended part of the course of action we are now taking.  Profitability has increased in the insurance industry.

Nonetheless, it is an issue that must be addressed by having more competition in the marketplace.  We are anxious to attract more competition.  It is not valid, however, to set that issue up as a counterpoint to the issue before the House, in terms of closing off a significant issue.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I think we should clarify our position on section 1 of the Bill, though the Minister has done his best to distort it.We sought a body such as the PIAB for years and, as in the case of the small claims court, its establishment was welcomed by all sides.  An efficient structure was required for dealing with personal injuries claims and the PIAB has benefited many, including 35,000 individuals who availed of its services last year.  It facilitates people who would not normally pursue a personal injury claim through the courts because it is such a stressful process.  With few exceptions people would prefer to be anywhere but court.Opposition spokespersons teased out the legislation establishing the PIAB at length.  We were given repeated assurances on Committee Stage that the safety net allowing people to take a case to court would be retained.We have no choice but to repeat many of the arguments.  I am not convinced by the Minister's argument for introducing the legislation.  Of the 40,000 personal injury cases registered last year, 35,000 went before the PIAB and 5,000 went to court.  Surely these figures demonstrate that the introduction of such draconian legislation is unnecessary.  If only 5,000 of the 40,000 people who could have taken a case to court chose to do so, this legislation is redundant.People of no means or property will be most affected by the Bill and will be deterred from taking cases to court.  We should not allow those with valid cases to be dissuaded from going to court.  In recent months, several high profile people pursued cases through the courts with no regard for the consequences or costs.  People of no means or property will not pursue cases in the courts because they will be afraid of losing what little they have and finding themselves in debt for the rest of their lives.Who is driving the Minister's agenda?  Who asked for the amendments to be made?  One sometimes finds that those who have acquired a little power want to amass more power.  In this case, the PIAB is not satisfied that 35,000 cases appear before it each year and wants all personal injury cases to come before it.  In acceding to this demand the Minister is undermining the constitutional protection to take a case a court.  This legislation will be challenged and struck down.The Chair's ruling on the amendment is unfair and should be reconsidered.  We must assume that those who take cases to court will win and are not all fraudsters.  What is the potential charge?  The figure cited of €75 million is clearly calculated on the basis that the 40,000 individuals who took a case last year would all win cases in court.The legislation is deeply flawed and unnecessary.  Legislation considered necessary is sometimes found to be flawed.  In this case, the Bill is unnecessary because it relates to 5,000 people who are dissatisfied with the award they receive from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The courts vindicated a person who took a case to court.  Is information available on the number of other successful court challenges to PIAB awards?  The House needs an answer to this question.It is wrong of the Minister to twist the facts concerning our position on the PIAB.  All Opposition parties voted in favour of its establishment.  However, the amending legislation before us is stand-alone in nature and goes too far.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It is disingenuous of the Minister to blame the Opposition for the fact that the Bill must come before the House.  That is not the case.  If one examines the record of the debates on the principal legislation in 2003, it is clear the Opposition parties and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, engaged in a constructive dialogue on Committee Stage.  The then Minister had the same legal adviser, an eminent former Attorney General, as the current Minister.  We warned of problems ahead regarding access to solicitors and redress for the legal costs incurred by the claimant.  We also argued it would not be possible under the Constitution to completely eliminate access to the legal framework for clients.  The Minister rejected our argument but was proven wrong in the O'Brien case adjudicated on by Mr. Justice McMenamin.Based on legal opinion we make the same case today.  The Minister has the same legal adviser as his predecessor and a belt and braces approach has been taken under the new Attorney General.  Our legal opinion is that the legislation is unconstitutional because it proposes to deny citizens access to certain legal rights.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board could easily have availed of an option to have money lodged in court.  I do not understand the reason it does not utilise this facility.  Why does it not agree terms in court at an early stage and before most costs have been incurred?  Only a small amount of costs are incurred in the early part of the legal process.  The expensive phase begins once court proceedings commence.  Money can be lodged in court early in the proceedings and efforts made to reach an agreement between the parties.  This practice is not in evidence.  Perhaps the Minister will make representations to the PIAB to determine whether this approach would speed up cases, reduce costs and benefit consumers.The arguments made by the Fine Gael and Labour parties in 2003 were constructive and supportive of the establishment of  Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which my party continues to support.  While the Minister can twist and turn this fact, it remains indisputable.  Legal opinion available to us suggests the Minister's approach to this matter is unconstitutional, although he is entitled to disagree.  When the case made by the Minister in 2003 was tested she was proved wrong.We hear a great deal about decreases in the cost of insurance premiums.  In 2002 and 2003, every Minister referred to the events of 11 September 2001 which resulted in a 150% increase in the cost of insurance premiums.   Reinsurance companies did not want to take business from general insurance companies but their profitability or investment income did not reduce substantially.  The average increase was 150%, although it has reduced significantly from that level, which no economy could sustain.  Employer's liability, public liability and motor premiums have also reduced.As a former insurance broker, I understand how the system works.  However, it is no good to suggest that the benefits of the savings made by Personal Injuries Assessment Board — €45 million was the figure suggested — have arrived in the pockets of consumers in terms of broad choice, more competition and reduced premia.  The Financial Regulator's statistical review for 2005 suggested a 1.8% reduction in premia but in the same year there was a 26% increase in the profits of insurance companies to €418 million.  I am not surprised the Minister sees nothing wrong in this.  However, we need legislation on behalf of consumers so that where there are savings, the consumer gets a fair benefit, in the interests of competition.We were promised by the then Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, that she was ready and willing to go to London at any time to bring in a new insurance company and generate increased competition.  In fact, we were waiting with bated breath for the following couple of months to find out what new company was on the way to bring more competition.  It never arrived.  There are just four or five players in the general insurance market in Ireland.  Were it not for Quinn Direct, the situation would be different.  It made the major contribution towards generating competition in the Irish insurance market.  I salute the efforts of the Quinn Group.  Mr. Quinn put it up to those who had no stake in the country, and certainly no shareholding interests or investment intermediary interests.  Quinn Direct was the basis of the competition that came to the market; it came not from outside the country but from within.All the various promises and commitments regarding increased competition and more intense competition in the general insurance market arising from the 2003 legislation, including the commitments given by the then Minister, Deputy Harney, came to nothing.  The reality is the Irish insurance market is very small; we are only the size of Manchester.  We make a big deal about ourselves from time to time but there are only four or five companies prepared to do business in such a small market.  When one company is able to make as much in the Irish market as the British market, we know it will be happy to continue with the cosy arrangement that is in place at present.The Minister is intent on proceeding with the Bill and I understand the principle and logic behind that.  However, there comes a time when he must ask whether it can be implemented.  In the next couple of months, somebody will test this legislation.  Just as we warned it was unconstitutional to proceed with the 2003 Bill, so we give the same warning in this regard.  Bad law is not what we on this side of the House wish to support.  The wording and framing of section 1 is not appropriate, nor is how it is likely to be implemented.

It is far better than the old adversarial litigation system.  Let us not be qualifying and qualifying or saying: "On the one hand but also on the other..."

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	198	There is a classic "Tadhg an dá thaobh" aspect emerging in this debate.  Processing costs under the PIAB are on a fixed basis and are 70% cheaper than under the old litigation system.  The PIAB promotes the early settlement of claims.  It is open six days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  By facilitating contact and the exchange of papers between the parties, it is estimated that 40% of claims are resolved before assessment by the PIAB.  To date, the board has made more than 10,000 assessments.  It has delivered its assessments on average 75%faster than the law courts.  The average timeframe for an assessment to be made is 7.4 months from the date of consent, which is extremely favourable when compared with the 36 months under the old system.This has freed up the courts.  The number of High Court cases has reduced from more than 15,000 in 2004 to approximately 2,500 in 2006.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The Minister should introduce it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I will come to that shortly.  The estimated number of personal injury cases in the Circuit Court has fallen from 20,000 in 2004 to 5,000 in 2006.  Monthly insurance cost indices produced by the Central Statistics Office show that the cost of consumers' motor insurance is now at May 1997 levels, a matter I dealt with in my closing speech on Second Stage.Deputy Lynch referred to the numbers going to the courts.  The point is that a case does not have to go to court.  However, there is a difficulty.  It has become known throughout the solicitors' profession that if a claimant rejects the assessment made by the board, the respondent is likely to offer, tender or lodge the same amount of the assessment when proceedings are issued.  If the assessed figure is accepted at that stage, the plaintiff is entitled to have his or her costs.  This in effect means the primary purpose of the 2003 Act is thwarted.  Proceedings are instituted and legal costs are being needlessly incurred, and a coach and four may be driven through the legislation.  This is what has opened up.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The point is that people are not taking that.  They are not doing it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	210	In the second case, an assessment of €6,678 was declined by a claimant and was subsequently accepted after the issue proceedings.  The claimant's costs were taxed at €3,474.80, which included a professional fee of €1,300.  Costs incurred in regard to PIAB work were not allowed as only the costs of proceedings were awarded.  The assessment process was declined by the respondent in another case and subsequently settled.  Some €1,500 was sought by the claimant's solicitor for PIAB work in addition to the normal professional fee.There is no penalty for declining a PIAB assessment and later accepting the same amount after the issue of proceedings.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Costs have been recovered by claimants in cases where assessments are being rejected and subsequently accepted after the issue of proceedings.  Fees of €1,000 to €1,500 are being allowed by county registrars throughout the country for PIAB work in addition to the full professional fee of the proceedings.We are aware, and PIAB has raised the issue with me, that this is becoming a widespread practice.  The PIAB has independently confirmed with four county registrars that they either currently or will in the future allow costs of this magnitude.  I am informed that the anomaly was exposed at a recent Law Society seminar held on 13 March 2007.  It is legitimate to expect that this practice will become widespread.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	213	How many cases are involved?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The Deputy is missing the point.  The case does not have to go to court.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I know that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	218	That is the point I am making.  The loophole is there to be exploited before the case gets to court.  We are cutting off this loophole in the interests of the people of no property or no means.  This is to protect the people of no property or no means to whom Deputy Lynch alluded.  It is why we are moving with urgency.I respectfully suggest that if I introduced the Bill next year and the practice became widespread, Deputies throughout the House would attack me for not moving quickly enough when I was alerted by the PIAB to the loophole that was being exploited.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	219	So it is coming from the PIAB.

That is how politics works.  I am satisfied this is a reasonable position to adopt.  It is important we protect the edifice of the PIAB.  It has been good for people.  The practice that has emerged has the potential to undermine its work and impact on it significantly.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I have no problem with the PIAB.  I simply want to articulate a view on the protection of people's rights, particularly the right of access.  My words have been construed as an argument on behalf of the legal profession, which they are not.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I clarified that I accepted the Deputy's bona fides.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The people on the PIAB are eminent and competent and argue from another perspective.  They have processed many cases.  I have been asked to advise on awards and have told my clients that it would be difficult to better them in court.  That is a professional opinion.  Some insurance companies have computer systems which read medical reports and calculate the likely awards.  I do not believe it is possible to computerise the calculation of a personal injury award.  Two people in the same accident might sustain different injuries according to their predispositions, such as a weak back.If a solicitor or barrister states that in his or her professional opinion €15,000 is not sufficient to compensate a person for injuries, the person will reject the award and go to court.  The court may, however, award €14,999 because there are no rules for awards, apart from the books of quantum.  The costs of the action are then levied against the person.  The PIAB was set up for a good reason and was supported by almost everyone in the House.  It has been subjected to various comments but has stood the test of time.  While I understand the Minister's concerns in the situation I outlined the court would have no discretion but to impose a court order for the defendant's costs and the plaintiff would have to pay his or her costs too, despite having been professionally advised that the PIAB award was inadequate.  That is one of the special circumstances covered by Deputy Lynch's amendment.  That is what happened in the O'Brien case.The PIAB has worked extremely hard, has made quick decisions and is accessible and helpful.  I have made inquiries and have found it helpful in that regard.  It appears insurance companies get the rub of the green because they do not pass on the benefit of their high profits to their customers.  PIAB has helped to reduce premiums but was not the sole impetus behind that development.This amendment will immutably hammer into the legislation that no discretion will be vested in a member of the Judiciary to examine the issue of costs from the perspectives I have outlined.  I have no gripe against the PIAB.I did not know about Gerard Hogan's opinion.  I had my view on the matter and am glad it coincided with that of someone more eminent than me.  I am astounded that section 51B subsections (1) and (2) exist.  They add nothing to the Bill.  Legal representation is more than advocacy.  It is advice on the conduct of pleas at every step.  For that reason people in the system who consider whether to accept their awards would have a legitimate right to expect their costs would be covered.  I am as subject to correction as anyone else but as I understand these subsections those people no longer have that right and that applies retrospectively.  That is an extraordinary proposition.  The Minister is well aware of the case concerning long-stay charges in nursing homes that arose in 2005.  This provision is suspect and one does not have to look back as far as the Heneghan case to realise it may be challenged.Our job is not to act as promoters or cheerleaders for legislation.  If we make valid points in the House I do not expect people to say we do so because we have particular interests.  Our role is to ensure legislation is subject to detailed scrutiny, invigilation and critical analysis.  Our points are bona fides, for example, that this provision may be constitutionally suspect.  If so, it will be subject to judicial review.  I have no special insight into this and have no personal interest in the matter.  I do not have the time to even contemplate such a case but somebody will examine it.  I did not know about Gerard Hogan's opinion when I read these provisions yesterday and thought they were fraught with difficulty.  Gerard Hogan is an eminent constitutional lawyer.That is the point I wish to make, maybe in a scattergun approach but we can be more focused on Committee Stage.  I have no axe to grind with the Minister or anybody else but it is incumbent on me to scrutinise legislation fairly and impartially.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I found the Minister's response to the Second Stage debate entirely unconvincing.  The fact that he pointed to vested interests and U-turns is indicative of the paucity in his own case.  He is unable to address the points raised by Deputies Kathleen Lynch, Quinn, Penrose, Hogan and Creighton or to deal with them in a constructive manner.  Accordingly, I am anxious to make a brief contribution.My question concerns the nub of the argument.  Is the PIAB on the side of the victim or biased against the claimant?  Where stands the Personal Injuries Assessment Board vis-à-vis the victim?  The Minister says the PIAB is the defender of victims’ rights for €50.  The basis of the establishment of the PIAB in 2003 was to reduce the costs and overheads involved in personal injuries.  If we take that as the sole objective, which we must, given the speech on Second Stage by the Minister’s predecessor, I must question the assertion of the Minister today that PIAB is on the side of the claimant and the victim.  I question it because many claimants are unhappy.I am a member of the Law Society but do not engage in these cases at all, being primarily a conveyancer.  However, I raise the issue in the context of public policy and the entitlement of the citizen of the State to pursue an action where the person believes there is a wrong or an unfairness.  The Minister is closing a resort that has been heretofore available to deal with such people's grievances.  It was perfectly in order in the parent legislation of 2003 to go to court following the rejection of an assessment but the Minister, in passing today's legislation, is stacking the odds very unfairly against the victim, the claimant, the applicant and the plaintiff to the court and that is where I have a difficulty.Lawyers and the parties involved are obliged before an action under family law to engage in counselling.  The opportunity for counselling before proceeding to court is a good thing.  Similarly, in the personal injuries legislation, there is an opportunity for an assessment without the need to resort to court.  I accept the fact that professional costs were high and I also accept the general principle of the legislation.  However, the Minister is now closing that opportunity and stacking the odds very much in favour of the PIAB.  It is a group that has been, and will be, on the side of insurance companies.  Being respondents to actions, insurance companies have the best legal brains available to them as well as the biggest pockets with which to engage them.  The fact that insurance companies will not be devoid of legal representation in the form of the highest professional expertise available compounds the unfairness.The Minister is now telling the victims that if they are not happy with the PIAB, they must proceed to court very much on their own.  He is creating such a disincentive that it actually will not happen.  He is denying the claimant the right to seek recourse to the courts, which is where we have the constitutional difficulty about which Deputy Penrose spoke.  The Minister is introducing an indirect prohibition on legal representation and I agree with the well-reasoned points made by Deputy Penrose on that matter, which I will not repeat.It is a pity there was no public consultation or committee hearings on the issue.  There were no opportunities for Dáil Deputies, as elected Members, to make representations on behalf of the public or put questions to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which has driven this legislation from start to finish and ensured the Minister moved quickly without the opportunity for public debate.  It is disingenuous of him to point to the fact that the legislation was published in April.  He knows, as does everybody, that there was no political debate in April or May other than on the big issue, the general election.  It is nonsense to suggest there was adequate opportunity for debate.The taking of all Stages of Bills in one day is fraught with difficulties but suits the strong arm of the ministerial Department in that it ensures there is neither adequate debate nor adequate time for amendments to be tabled.  Amendments are ruled out of order at the drop of a hat, which brings this House into disrepute.Finally, many claimants are unhappy and the level of frustration with the personal injuries process is far higher than the Minister acknowledges.  By his actions today, he is further bolstering the edifice of the PIAB against the rights of the individual and I believe this measure will be struck down as constitutionally repugnant.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I have a brief question for the Minister.  The new section 51B(1) provides that no legal costs shall be allowed for the making of an application to the PIAB.  What is the position of that new section in the context of the judgment of Justice McMenamin in the O'Brien case on the issue of legal costs for applicants to the PIAB?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I accept from Deputy Penrose's contribution that he does not have issues with the PIAB.  I welcome his comments and, as I said in my response on Second Stage, I accept his bona fides.  I do not see him as approaching the subject with a vested interest at all.  I understand and value the point he made but the question of the exception becoming the rule is the problem we face as we attempt to close off a loophole.I will pose the same question to Deputies Penrose and Charles Flanagan.  Why should a process that at the moment costs €50 cost €1,500?  Why should we preside over that?  Senator O'Toole made the point very elegantly in the other House when he asked that question.  It would be the exact same service involving no additional benefits.

The PIAB is all about that.  I am getting mixed messages from the Fine Gael benches.

It seeks to provide a very good service.  The old litigation service, as Deputy Charles Flanagan should know, being in the legal profession, was appalling.  It was an adversarial system that lasted, in some cases, for three years which is an appalling situation for people with personal injuries.  The PIAB is an effective instrument for which the Oireachtas, on all sides of both Houses, can take credit.

I am not saying it is perfect or that we cannot have a continual review, but we should keep a balance and perspective in our commentary.  It is not about the strong arm.

Late this morning, part of a limestone stairs in the private part of the Natural History Museum fractured and collapsed.  Some 21 primary teachers attending a science appreciation course were in that part of the building at the time.  A number of those attending were in the vicinity of the stairs.  The museum immediately notified the emergency services, tended to the injured, evacuated and closed the building.  I understand 11 people were injured.  The emergency services, museum safety staff and gardaí were immediately on the scene.  I am grateful for their swift response.  As soon as I was informed of the tragedy, I visited the museum together with the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Noel Ahern, to see the extent of the incident and offer whatever help we could.  I was briefed by the director of the museum and I requested that the museum should remain closed and be subjected to a rigorous structural and safety audit, which he will now commence.The emergency services were on the scene within minutes and the injured were taken to St. James's, St. Vincent's and the Mater hospitals.  The public part of the museum was immediately evacuated and the museum's emergency plan was fully activated.  Pending a full health and safety audit by the Health and Safety Authority, and other relevant authorities, the Natural History Museum will remain closed to visitors for the foreseeable future.At this juncture, I am glad to say I have been informed that none of the injuries is life threatening.  The director of the museum, its board, and the Department will continue to monitor developments.  On behalf of everybody in the House, I extend our heartfelt sympathies to those who were injured, and to their families.  I wish them a speedy and full recovery.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I join with the Minister in offering our good wishes for a speedy recovery to all those who were injured.  I totally support the Minister's call for an audit of the building, following which an immediate investment should be made in the museum.  For some time, I have been calling for a significant investment in the structures not only of the Natural History Museum, but also the National Museum and the National Writers' Museum.  This incident is a wake-up call.  I urge the Minister to follow up on this rigorously and not to delay the implementation of a programme to ensure the building is safe not only for the staff but also for the thousands of people who visit the museum everyyear.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I concur with the previous speakers in wishing well those who suffered trauma this morning.  It is a matter of serious concern for them and their families, although it is good to hear that their health has not been seriously affected.  I congratulate the work of the emergency services.  From the minute word of the incident came, we saw those services take action.  It is always a revelation to see how organised they are.  I remember being on the dual carriageway that famous morning when a major crash occurred and I saw the emergency services at work then also.  They are to be congratulated on their efforts.  A mechanism has now been put in place to ensure the safety of the building.  Everything will be done to restore it to its position as part of our heritage, including its educational role.  Given the number of visitors to the museum every day, that work needs to be undertaken as a matter of urgency.  I am sure the Minister and his Minister of State will ensure that happens.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Last autumn the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George's Dock on a build, finance and maintain basis.  Arising from the Government decision, an interagency steering committee was set up to oversee the project.  The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, the Office of Public Works, the Abbey Theatre and the Dublin Docklands Development Agency.The steering group has met three times and is due to meet again on 20 July.  A process auditor has been appointed, in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.  At its first meeting in December 2006, the committee decided the Office of Public Works should prepare the documentation necessary for holding an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre.A project team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and representative of the same agencies as the steering group, with the exception of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, has also been set up and is currently overseeing the arrangements for holding the international design competition.  The OPW has asked the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, to organise the competition.  The RIAI, with the assistance of the OPW, is in the process of drafting the competition regulations.  The technical documentation for the competition must be carefully specified.  A jury is also being set up to select the winning design.  The jury will have representatives from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the OPW, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Arts Council, the Abbey Theatre and some international figures in the architectural and theatre worlds.Discussions are currently ongoing between the Abbey and the OPW on the detailed accommodation brief for the new theatre.  In the meantime, the OPW is working on the preliminary drafting of output specifications.  It is also liaising with the NDFA on assembling technical advisor teams, with a view to progressing the project as much as possible while the design competition is being held.The NDFA has recently appointed legal advisers arising from a market exercise.  When a winning design has been chosen the NDFA will oversee the procurement process in accordance with PPP guidelines.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I congratulate the Minister on taking over his new portfolio and wish him the best of luck.The issue of providing a new national theatre has been going on for approximately ten years.  As the Minister said, last July, the relocation of the national theatre to George's Dock was approved by the Government.  The then Minister made a public statement in September that there would be an international design competition.  On 26 October last year, the previous Minister said he hoped to have a design by the summer of 2007.  We are now well into the summer, yet we still do not have a competition, not to mention a design.  I hope there will be no further procrastination.  There is a need for a new national theatre.  The temporary arrangement, including the provision of new seating, is not good enough.  Will the Minister give us a realistic timescale for the publication of the international design competition?  How long will it take to process the various interests that respond?  Realistically, when does the Minister think the first block will be laid for the new theatre?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I thank the Deputy for his kind wishes.  The portfolio is a bit of a change from social welfare.  I look forward to working with the Opposition spokespersons for the benefit of the arts, sport and tourism in Ireland.The completion date I have for the entire project is 2010.  In the course of the next three years, therefore, all these steps must be taken.  The best estimate I have from the Department is a completion date, all going well, of mid-2010.  We will get through all these processes in the next three years, including the design competition, the PPP development, the National Development Finance Agency, and the procurement process.  In the coming 36 months, all of those hurdles must be overcome.I would like to see a landmark building emerging from this development.  This generation has been slow to provide such edifices.  The quality of architecture is first class and that is why I am glad we are holding a truly international competition.  This generation has been somewhat shy, however, in leaving the nation with some good, iconic, landmark buildings.  This will be an opportunity to do so.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I certainly agree with the Minister's remarks.   I believe €130 million was earmarked for this development and I ask the Minister to confirm this.  Is the Minister entirely confident that the jury, to use his word, that has been selected will have the competence to judge this international design competition?  Perhaps international consultants could be added to help the jury.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	261	If the Deputy has any suggestions regarding international consultants I will certainly consider them.  We are proposing to include international figures from the worlds of theatre and architecture on the jury.Regarding costing, this project is a public private partnership so, in that sense, it is difficult to produce an exact figure but it is expected to be around €150 million.  One must appreciate that this figure dates from 2004 or 2005 and may not be the same in 2010.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.I am aware that the Irish Sports Council, under its research remit, is striving to develop a profound understanding of sport in Ireland that can inform policy and investment over the coming years.  It commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake studies on its behalf.  Four major reports have already been published, each one adding to our knowledge of sport in this country.The fourth report in the series, Fair Play? Sport and Social Disadvantage in Ireland, to which the Deputy refers, set out to examine the impact of social disadvantage on various forms of participation in sport.  The report concludes that the large majority of people who play sport in Ireland and who enjoy the health benefits arising from this activity are from higher income and better-educated social groups.The report makes a clear case in support of substantial public expenditure to increase participation in sport.  This justifies the significant Government investment in sport in recent years.  The budget for sport has increased from €17 million in 1997 to over €295 million in 2007.  By the end of 2006, over €900 million had been invested directly in sport since 1997 to support the promotion and development of sport at all levels.  Furthermore, the National Development Plan 2007-13 includes a commitment to provide €991 million for sport under the aegis of my Department during that period.The increased funding provided to the Irish Sports Council, from €13 million in 2000 to over €54 million this year, has enabled a number of significant interventions for the benefit of disadvantaged areas.  Examples include the local sports partnerships network, development officers in national governing bodies and special funding to the FAI, GAA and IRFU.The ESRI report concludes that disadvantage starts at an early age and there is evidence that disadvantage begins to affect some children's involvement in sport from a very young age.  In this regard I am pleased that the Irish Sports Council's buntús programme is now rolling out to primary schools in local sports partnership areas.One of the stated objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports programmes.  In this regard the Deputies will be aware of the RAPID and CLÁR programmes and local drugs task force areas.  My Department liaises closely with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pobail and local authorities with a view to emphasising investment in disadvantaged areas.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I congratulate both the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Brennan, on their new positions.  I am sure we will have many constructive debates.This report highlights points I have been making for a long time and I will read an extract from the second paragraph on the second page.  It states, "Seen in this light a concern with Irish sports policy is that it relies almost exclusively on improvements in facilities to increase involvement, with little contact or communication directed towards people who do not currently participate in sport."  This represents a major problem.Local clubs and teams cherry-pick the best players in estates that experience anti-social behaviour and nothing is being done to involve more children from the areas highlighted in the report.  I asked the previous Minister to examine this issue because there is a need to provide personnel along with facilities and, in doing so, move the goalposts regarding funding.  Some clubs have used funding for the advancement of their communities while others have used it for members' facilities and this is where questions arise.  Can the Minister direct the Irish Sports Council to have more involvement in communities, rather than clubs?  We must foster communities, rather than clubs, around the facilities that have been provided.Sports partnerships are a good thing but are understaffed.  In local sports partnerships in Kildare only two people cater for 150,000 people and this is not enough to address the problems that exist.  Can the Minister move the goalposts towards the facilities and personnel aspects of lottery funding?  Can he increase the number of staff involved in local sports partnerships to give them the opportunity to build on the good work that is being done?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I will look at the issues the Deputy has raised.  None of us can be proud of the conclusion in the report that the large majority of people who play sports in Ireland, and who enjoy the health benefits arising from those activities, are from higher-income and better-educated social groups.  It is good that these people benefit but, having spent almost three years at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I know that sport can play a significant role in tackling disadvantage.  I propose, during my time in this office, to give priority to those experiencing disadvantage because sport provides great opportunities to tackle the issue and make a difference to communities, individuals and broken families.  We must try to absorb the findings of this report and focus more on bringing the benefits of sport to disadvantaged areas, communities and individuals.  I will return to the House on this issue because I intend to put a significant amount of work into the area.Local sports partnerships have received €16 million in Government funding since they were set up in 2001 and I have heard the Deputy's comments about Kildare.  A major initiative on disability officers and areas of disadvantage has come about through the dormant accounts fund and we will press ahead with such projects.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I appeal to the Minister to listen to the Opposition, whatever roles we may have next September.  Over the past five years Deputy Wall and I came up with many ideas and they were not always heard or implemented.  I think this Minister will listen to us and we are prepared to provide him with good ideas and initiatives.The Minister is obviously in agreement with the report and it is stark in its analysis.  It is based on the available data so it is almost certain that public money spent on sport in Ireland is regressive and represents a transfer of resources from the less well-off to the better-off.  The report plainly shows that levels of participation in sport depend on household income and educational attainment and this is not right.  I ask the Minister to intervene through local sports partnerships and schools.  I posed the following question to the previous Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Will the Minister give priority to applications for lottery funding for sport halls which are submitted jointly by schools in a disadvantaged area and local sports clubs?  A change in policy in this regard would lead to sports halls being provided in disadvantaged areas nationwide.  Will he consider this request when allocating national lottery funds?

Anyone who works with me knows that I listen to ideas, including suggestions from the Opposition parties.  The Deputy should be careful what he recommends because he might not be too pleased if I act on his suggestions.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I have recommended this course of action for a long time.  The Minister would gain from it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I will listen carefully to Deputies' suggestions.  I will examine Deputy Wall's interesting proposal to fund sport in communities as opposed to clubs.  I do not have sufficient knowledge of the issue Deputy Deenihan raises but I promise to find out about it before sittings resume in September.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Perhaps the Minister is unaware of the two-tier system in sport.  Summer camps, a brilliant facility, are being arranged all over the country.  As a former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister will be aware that a single parent on social welfare receives around €185 weekly.  Enrolling a child in a summer camp would cost almost €70 or almost half of his or her weekly income.  For this reason, it is not an option.I hope the Minister and the Irish Sports Council will inform organisations which organise summer camps, for instance, the GAA and FAI, that they must reduce the horrendous fees they charge as they prevent wider participation and a greater social mix.  Most of the costs of summer camps are associated with equipment.  Will the Minister make representations to the Irish Sports Council to ensure wider participation in these camps, even if it means a young lad no longer gets a sports jersey at the end of the camp because this may prevent his neighbour or friend playing?  One can imagine the effect that exclusion from such events for financial reasons must have on children from families in the lower-income bracket.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	270	This is a timely debate with an ESRI report published recently and an exchange on this matter on the floor of the House.  It is time to take a long, hard look at this issue and I will do so urgently.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level.  The programme is open to applications from local authorities and other community organisations for the development of multisport facilities.  Under the 2007 programme, more than €5 million was allocated to multisport projects serving the wider community.  This is on the back of sustained sports capital investment in this sector over the lifetime of the previous Government.  In that period, sports capital funding of approximately €35.5 million was allocated to community or municipal multisport projects.  These projects not only meet local needs but also add considerably to national and regional sporting infrastructure.  This investment increases levels of participation and improves standards of performance.As the Deputy may be aware, a national audit of sports facilities is ongoing.  This will provide me with a more comprehensive picture of the distribution and availability of sports facilities across the country, including multisport facilities.  I will examine the outcome of this audit, particularly in the context of the development of the national sports facility strategy and the structure of the sports capital programme.  In addition, my Department will work closely with local authorities in the funding of key, multipurpose municipal sports facilities, which will be identified in the gateway and hub locations in the context of the implementation of the National Development Plan 2007-13.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I welcome the thrust of the Minister's response. While I realise that €5 million from a total budget of €80 million is a relatively small sum, a precedent has been established.  I ask the Minister to place particular emphasis on encouraging the main outdoor sporting codes, notably rugby, soccer and GAA, to work together to provide simple, shared facilities such as changing and weights rooms and medical facilities.  They could have their own ancillary facilities attached to these facilities.  Opportunities for such co-operation are available across the country.  We have seen changes in Croke Park and Lansdowne Road as a result of co-operation between the Gaelic, soccer and rugby codes.  The Minister should urge the sporting bodies to engage in greater co-operation.We have an ideal opportunity to emphasise to local authorities and the principal sporting organisations, particularly those involved in outdoor sports, including athletics, the importance of co-operation in providing shared local, multisport facilities.  Such co-operation should also be encouraged among the indoor sports codes although indoor facilities generally cater for all indoor sports.  The provision of facilities would be enhanced if such co-operation were encouraged.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	273	It is incumbent on all of us to get the best value for money from the annual budget of approximately €300 million.  I accept the Deputy's thesis that sharing facilities and co-operation between various sporting bodies must be at the heart of this approach.  To use dreadful business jargon we must sweat the assets because taxpayers' money is involved and must be used in a manner that delivers the optimum benefits.  This means sharing facilities, co-operating where possible and avoiding wasteful duplication.  This is common sense.   I accept the allocation of €5 million for multisport facilities is low and I will examine it.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Does the Minister plan to meet the national sporting organisations to discuss the concept of sharing facilities and the development of multisport facilities?  It would be a good initiative if he were to bring these bodies together and encourage them to co-operate in the provision of these facilities.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I have had initial meetings on broad policy issues with the chief executive of the Irish Sports Council and representatives of other sporting bodies.  I will meet representatives from all the major national governing bodies in sport in due course and I will keep the multisport concept firmly on the table.  My focus will be to ensure the €300 million of taxpayers' money will be used for good, strong social purposes, does not result in duplication and maximises the benefits to taxpayers.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I welcome the open skies agreement with the USA.   It is a very positive development for tourism here and has long been a major objective of tourism policy.  It has been supported by industry interests and endorsed by the tourism policy review group.  Already, following on from the open skies deal, Aer Lingus has announced new services to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles.The open skies regime will result in the phasing out of the Shannon stop-over policy.  This is a challenge and an opportunity for Shannon Airport.  If the airport is to successfully rise to this challenge, a number of issues will need to be addressed, including the efficiency of the airport, the development of new routes into Shannon Airport, improvements to the ground transport infrastructure around the airport and the further development of the tourism product around the region.I am pleased to note that significant progress has been made in recent months in putting the airport on a more sound business footing.  This is vital because if the airport does not deliver a cost-efficient service, its future will be limited.The Government, under its agreed programme, is committed to providing "significant infrastructural development in the Mid West area, as well as marketing support... for a transitional period to help consolidate existing markets and develop new sources of business".  To help deliver on this commitment, my colleague, the Minister for Transport and the Marine, is bringing an economic and tourism development plan for the Shannon Airport catchment area to the Cabinet.  The draft plan will address the marketing issue.  Whatever the Government decides in relation to the plan, the Deputy may assume Tourism Ireland, Shannon Development and other agencies will make a special drive to deal with the challenges facing the area.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Will the Minister ensure the provisions in the plan which I understand is a proposal to spend €10 million a year on the promotion of the Shannon area are put in place as soon as possible?  If the current routes are not supported, they could be withdrawn.  The Minister may be aware that American Airlines and Air Canada will cease operations in October and Delta Airlines which I understand operates flights to Atlanta, an important hub for Florida and southern USA, will cease operations on that route this winter.  This will be a major blow to Shannon Airport.  One major hotel in the Shannon area has had cancellations from 11 group tours, representing approximately 2,000 bed nights, due to the uncertainty regarding flights into the region in 2008.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure this fund is put in place immediately as, otherwise, there will be further cancellations and uncertainty.A recent programme on American television, "Where in the world is Matt Lauer?", was watched by 7 million people.  It showed beautiful images of the west of Ireland but, at the end of the programme, suggested that to get to Ireland, visitors should come through Dublin Airport.  There was no mention of Shannon Airport, which was an opportunity lost.Will the Minister indicate whether he has the information I seek?  How many seats are available in summer 2007 coming into Shannon Airport and how many will be available in 2008?  That is what matters.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I will have to wait until the Government concludes its thinking on the proposals from my colleague, the Minister for Transport and the Marine, in regard to an economic and tourism development plan for the Shannon Airport catchment area, which the Government will examine shortly.  The Deputy will recall that, as Minister for Transport, I put legislation through the House in regard to securing the independence of Shannon Airport and giving it the opportunity to develop its own future and attract its own visitors.  I accept there are challenges in the Shannon area as a result of the open skies regime but there are also opportunities.  The plan which the Minister for Transport and the Marine and I will bring forward will help considerably to bring additional numbers into the Shannon region.  There are approximately 300,000 North American visitors to the Shannon area annually, although I appreciate that this number has remained static and that the phasing out of the stopover will bring real challenges.  However, there is a strong board and strong leadership at the airport.  The new plan which I am confident the Government will put together will make a real difference to the region.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The Deputy will appreciate that any change to the tax law in regard to the charging of VAT is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen.  I am, however, aware of the issue regarding the charging of VAT on non-resident performers and artists and have been briefed on the matter recently by my officials.  I intend to explore it further, with a view to seeing if there is a way in which it can be addressed and, in the process, will consult the relevant bodies and organisations.  I intend to discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance in due course.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I am delighted the Minister is in favour of investigating the matter and having it rectified.  The situation is counterproductive, given what the Arts Council is attempting to achieve.  On the one hand, the council gives grants to festivals while, on the other, the 21% VAT rate is applied.  This does not help to attract the artists who would make a difference.  In many instances, local organising committees must give huge incentives to assist fund-raising.  If the 21% rate did not apply, it would be far easier for them to get the best artists and advance their festivals through the addition of workshops and so on but that is not possible due to the huge incentives needed to attract the artists in the first place.  The 21% rate is prohibitive.  I am pleased to note it is the Minister's intention to deal with the matter and consult the Minister for Finance.  We will keep in contact in this regard because the issue has a major effect.  Whether a festival is small or large, the VAT rate is a major impediment to its progress.  It is welcome the Minister has been briefed and that some action will be taken.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I will certainly discuss the matter with my colleague.  The Deputy will recall that the Revenue Commissioners gave a one-year derogation in 2002 in regard to exemption from this charge on the basis of a request from the Arts Council.  However, there has been no progress on the matter since.  The difficulty is that the people who attend these gatherings, by and large, do not pay VAT on tickets.  Therefore, when the organisation involved comes to recoup VAT, it does not have VAT payments against which to offset the VAT it is required to pay.  We thought we were doing the right thing in removing VAT from entrance charges.  However, an unintended consequence is that the organisation does not have a claimable mechanism available to it.  In a way, we set out to do good work but it had this unintended consequence which I will discuss with the Department of Finance.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  I welcome his statement on the 21% VAT rate.  Progress in this area is essential to deal with the issue of developing the arts.  The Minister must prioritise spending and support for the arts in the next five years, given that artists make a major contribution to the country and the development of communities.As we are dealing with the issue of sports, will the Minister join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to the family of the late Derek Dougan who played for Wolves and Northern Ireland and made a massive contribution to sport in this country, particularly——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am sure this is very important but we might confine ourselves to the question in the short time we have available.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I understand.  Will the Minister join me in expressing public sympathy to the family of the late Derek Dougan who made a massive contribution to sport on the island?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am sure the Minister will agree that the quality of a festival is very much determined by its participants.  Unless a festival committee or organisation is able to attract major international artists, it will not attract as many people.  Festivals are becoming very competitive.  If one wants an international audience and to encourage tour operators to bring visitors, big names are needed.  The VAT rate certainly inhibits organisers in getting major names to perform.  The Minister may be aware that as Northern Ireland excludes VAT, we are at a disadvantage as regards festivals there.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Minister is wrong to state there is a loss to the Exchequer with regard to VAT on tickets.  In fact, the more a festival grows, the more opportunities there will be regarding bed nights, restaurants, petrol and food sales.  If the organisers can increase the value of the festival by bringing in more international artists it will bring in more people and the Exchequer will benefit.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I was not saying that the Exchequer would lose out but that under the mechanism by which VAT is collected one offsets the VAT one pays against that which is charged in.  If no VAT is charged in on tickets there is no mechanism for reclaiming it.  My point is a technical one but I accept the Deputy's broader point.I join with Deputy Finian McGrath in expressing my admiration for the wonderful contribution made in the case he mentioned and extend our expressions of sympathy to the family of Derek Dougan.I plan to make a fuller statement on investment in the arts and the future as I see it, hopefully soon.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The latest figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that there was an increase of over 4% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in the first four months of the year compared with the same period in 2006.  While it will be challenging to maintain the record-breaking performance of 2006, these latest CSO figures confirm that Ireland's tourism sector continues to perform at a very impressive level.Mainland Europe continues to be our strongest performing market with an increase of almost 25% in visitor numbers during the four month period up to the end of April compared with the corresponding period in 2006.  The North American market has also shown a good performance for the beginning of the year with an increase of 3.4%, while other long-haul markets are up by almost 12%.  The figures for North America are particularly encouraging when viewed in the context of the relative strength of the euro against the dollar.The number of visitors from Britain for the first four months is down by over 5% compared with the same period in 2006.  This is disappointing but is consistent with a general trend of reduced numbers of outward travellers from Great Britain to European destinations in the early part of this year.  It is believed that interest rate increases and other factors may be impacting on consumer discretionary spending power.  The numbers coming to Ireland from Britain for holiday purposes were up by over 6% for the first quarter of the year.Tourism Ireland is undertaking its biggest ever marketing campaign in Britain this year.  This includes spending €6 million to highlight regional attractions.  This campaign, which commenced in April, will run through July and I am confident that the months ahead will show the benefits for this most important market.  Additional marketing activity is also planned for the autumn, with a particular focus on the short breaks programme.Considering that 2006 broke all records in terms of overseas visitor numbers and associated revenue, we have set a challenging target of a further 5% growth in visitor numbers and 7.3% in associated revenue for 2007.  I am confident that the record levels of Exchequer investment for tourism services this year, €159 million, will enable both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to implement a comprehensive set of programmes to help ensure that these targets are met.  In particular, the marketing fund of €45 million, an increase of 12.5% on last year's provision, has allowed both agencies to step up their marketing activities significantly.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	289	There has been growth in short breaks here but concern has repeatedly been expressed about the need to encourage British families to travel outside the Pale.  The west and south of Ireland have suffered and we do not seem to be able to break that pattern.  Short breaks are the most attractive option for the tourism industry.How many of the British visitors on short breaks were families?  How does the funding for marketing in Britain break down as between holidays in Dublin and the rest of the country?  Are we getting full benefit from the British market when the exchange rate between sterling and the euro is good?  Is it feasible to extend the family holiday outside the capital city?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am concerned about the number of visitors from Britain and will talk to the agencies about addressing this issue.  Tourism Ireland has undertaken its biggest ever marketing campaign this year and I propose to examine that carefully to ensure that it is focused.  Last year we had over 4 million visitors from Britain which was an increase of 6% on the previous year.  There has been some softness in the market for the first four months of this year and the number is down 5% on last year.There are major challenges in Irish tourism, including cost competitiveness, focus and investment and I propose to study these carefully to see how to respond to them.  We cannot take Irish tourism for granted.  That is important.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Traditionally British tourists served rural areas well.  They supported small operators in the west and in Kerry principally because they brought their own cars.  There is a significant fall-off in the number of tourists from the UK coming here with their cars.  We all recall seeing the GB plate on cars around the country when we were youngsters.  They are not so prevalent now.Will the Minister ask Tourism Ireland and the ferry companies to concentrate on attracting the car driving tourist back into Ireland because rural areas benefited more from their business?  Our roads have improved to some extent, and are less dangerous than they were.Will the Minister encourage Tourism Ireland to sell our culture and heritage more?  UK tourists find our culture and heritage, especially the ecclesiastical heritage, rather fascinating.  We have not focused on this in the past.The Minister turned the sod on the famous Lartigue Railway which is now up and running and attracting many UK tourists with very little marketing.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I recall launching the Lartigue Railway when we were doing the Millennium Project.  I have built a couple of railways since then on a larger scale, particularly the Luas.  It is not quite Lartigue but it does the job.I do not have the figures that Deputy Wall wanted on the numbers of families taking short breaks but I will get them for him.  I agree with Deputy Deenihan in regard to bringing more families and more of the car business from the United Kingdom.  Tourism Ireland launched its biggest ever marketing campaign there last April under the direction of my predecessor who is now Ceann Comhairle.  That campaign is going well.  One of its objectives is to do as the Deputy suggested and to highlight the heritage and artistic benefits of visiting Ireland apart from the lovely weather.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The previous Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism established a high level London 2012 task force to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  This task force includes experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and is supported by staff within my Department.One of the first pieces of work that the task force carried out was an audit of high quality facilities suitable to attract international athletes to train in the years running up to the London 2012 Games.The superb national rowing centre in Cork is one of the facilities the audit has examined.  Given the paramount training requirements of Irish Olympic and Paralympic athletes and the exacting requirements of Olympic and Paralympic standard facilities, the audit has concluded that there is a limited capacity to host foreign Olympic and Paralympic athletes in training camps in Ireland prior to the London 2012 Olympic Games, although I have asked the Department to look again at this.In parallel with the audit and to better inform the future work of the task force, my Department appointed Indecon International economic consultants to carry out an economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  This evaluation is now nearing completion.  Overall, the most important economic benefits likely to accrue to Ireland from our proximity to the London Games are in the tourism and business sectors.In the sporting sector, more significant economic benefits are likely to accrue in attracting Olympic qualification tournaments to Ireland.  Our experience to date in attracting major sporting events to Ireland, such as the Special Olympics and the Ryder Cup, has been very positive and the economic impact of such events is far greater than that arising from a small number of elite athletes training for limited periods.  My Department, in consultation with the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Irish Sports Council and the national governing bodies of sport, is pursuing a number of high profile Olympic qualification events that will benefit the economy and give Irish athletes home advantage in their quest to qualify for the London Olympic Games.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	294	How many actual facilities meet the training brief for international athletes for the Olympic Games?  Did only the national rowing centre in Cork and Abbotstown meet the necessary criteria?  It seems funny to say we do not have the facilities but will look to host qualifications for the Olympic Games.  The national boxing stadium recently hosted the European Union championships, in which Irish boxers were very successful, winning five out of 11 titles.  Does the Minister intend that we host individual events such as boxing or triathlon, which was recently held very successfully in Kildare?  Can the Minister say how many facilities there are and what qualification events we are considering?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	295	My predecessor established the London 2012 task force last August and it has done very good work.  We are awaiting the final report of Indecon International economic consultants, which was commissioned by the task force and is nearing completion.  I would prefer to postpone detailed discussion until I have the report but the task force is of a very high order and comprises very experienced people representing different organisations.  They are all well aware of the opportunities for a number of sports to attract qualification rounds, such as basketball, boxing, equestrian events, hockey, rowing, sailing and soccer.  I hope the House will have a full discussion on the report as soon as it is available.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment.  Given the dearth of sporting facilities in Dublin North, what is the situation regarding the swimming pool grant in Balbriggan, which has very few sporting facilities?  Are there any plans for one in Swords?  What is the situation with regard to the Portmarnock sports and leisure centre pool?

I feel such a focus is required.  A task force is one thing and it has performed well but we need a high-profile person to take responsibility for selling Ireland to various countries around the world.

I would be interested in its members' advice on that subject.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 36 and 43 together.On 5 April last, the contract for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin was awarded to Spencer Dock Convention Centre Dublin Limited.  Under the public private partnership arrangement, Spencer Dock Convention Centre Dublin Limited is required to design, build and finance the national conference centre and to operate and maintain it for a period of 25 years, after which the facility will revert to the State.  In return, once the construction of the centre is complete and it is open for business, the State will pay the company an annual charge, the maximum total cost of which over 25 years will be just under €380 million in present day values.The centre will be capable of accommodating up to 2,000 delegates in plenary session.  It will also have 22 multi-purpose meeting rooms and approximately 4,500 m2 of flexible exhibition and banqueting space, along with associated press and delegate support facilities and general utility spaces.  The centre, which is to be known as the convention centre Dublin, is scheduled to open on 1 September 2010.  In the meantime, the operators, in co-operation with Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Dublin Convention Bureau, will be engaged in marketing the centre to secure bookings for 2010 and after.  In addition, the prospects for the successful marketing and operation of the facility will be considerably enhanced by the VAT deductibility of accommodation expenses for business conferences, announced in last December's budget at the behest of my predecessor and included in this year's Finance Act.The imminent realisation of a national conference centre in Ireland represents a wonderful boost for Irish tourism and for the economy generally.  According to a number of independent estimates, the national conference centre, when fully operational, is expected to generate additional foreign revenue earnings of between €25 million and €50 million per year.  Currently, promotable business tourism attracts 295,000 visitors and is worth €475 million to the economy annually.  Fáilte Ireland's target now is to grow this sector to 600,000 promotable business visitors with a revenue value of €1 billion by 2013.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I have a few questions on the cost to the Exchequer over the 25-year period before the facility is handed back to the taxpayer.  The Minister said it would cost €380 million.  Is there a fee on the handover or does it come back automatically without a fee?  Will the Minister confirm the date the centre is supposed to be up and running?I welcome progress on this issue.  It is a question I have asked at almost every Question Time for the past five years.  I recognise the work done by the Ceann Comhairle in progressing the project when he was Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  It is a very important project.  Barcelona has four conference centres and we saw what a conference centre did for Birmingham.  It will provide a major boost to the economy of Dublin city.In the proposal for the Shannon region there is a recommendation, supported by the Irish Hotels Federation, that the Government consider a similar conference centre in the Shannon region, otherwise all business tourism would come into Dublin and the centre in this city would take business tourism away from other parts of the country.  Will the Minister comment on that?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The centre is scheduled to open on 1 September 2010.  Once it is open for business, the State will pay the company an annual charge.  The maximum total cost over 25 years will be just under €380 million.  That is net current value.  An annual payment will be made that adds up to no more than €380 million at net current value.  I do not know whether there is an additional handover fee.  That would be a contractual matter and I will have to come back to the Deputy on it.There is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine the feasibility of a conference centre in the Shannon region.  I will move that forward as quickly as possible.  The Ceann Comhairle does not need me to plámás him in any way, but we should all salute his work in delivering these projects.  It will stand as one of many monuments to the man in this Department, where he did a tremendous job.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I also compliment the Ceann Comhairle on this.  It moved on in his term in the Department and it is great that we will now have a national conference centre.  Will there be transport infrastructure in line with the conference centre?  Will there be a Luas connection to Spencer Dock and what will be the timescale for that?  It needs to be built by 1 September 2010.

They fit in fairly well with the delivery date of 2010.  I will have to get more specific delivery dates, but we are committed to developing the Luas in the docklands area, which will be an enormous help to the convention centre.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I want to be associated with the congratulations to the Ceann Comhairle on the conference centre.  Is the Minister happy with the size of the centre, with a capacity of 2,000?  I have been at medical conferences where 5,000 and 10,000 people have attended.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	310	It was studied very carefully and the optimum figure was 2,000 delegates.  If we fill it with 2,000 delegates on a regular basis, it will be more beneficial to us than on the rare occasion in which we will get 5,000 or 10,000, unless there is a Fine Gael Ard-Fheis being held.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	311	They are getting bigger all the time.  Tourism Ireland is promoting the conference centre, as the Minister stated.  Generally speaking, some of these companies often plan conferences two, three or four years in advance.  Can the Minister refer to the initiatives that are ongoing at the moment?  Have businesses already shown an interest in holding conferences in Ireland?  What are the plans to promote this centre?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I will have another occasion to outline that in more detail.  Fáilte Ireland and the Dublin Convention Bureau are already engaged in marketing the centre.  They are actively looking for bookings for 2010 and afterwards.

If business is being displaced from Kerry or other places, then it will not serve its purpose.  It is very important that new business should be targeted.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I take the Deputy's point.  The facility will be here at that date and it is incumbent on us to fill the halls.  I am greatly encouraged that the bodies are actively marketing at this point to ensure we have bookings.  The convention business is long term and companies must book many years in advance.  Systems are in place all over the country to book most of our conference facilities for 2010, 2011 and thereafter.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 12 together.I refer the Deputy to my answer earlier today to Priority Question No. 1.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Government has provided €149 million under the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013 for the development of a national sports campus at Abbotstown.  The Government has already approved the development of facilities under phase one of a development control plan prepared by CSID, the predecessor of the National Sports Campus Development Authority, NSCDA.  These facilities will be designed to meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons who compete at national and international levels, and will also provide for the needs of the local community.  Preliminary planning for this phase has begun and the NSCDA has advertised a competition to appoint a design team and a project management team for the project.The facilities to be provided in phase one of the project will include a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 20 national governing bodies of sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and the renovation of existing buildings to provide administrative offices for sporting bodies.The Government decision for this stage of development included agreement to move the headquarters of the Football Association of Ireland to the former State laboratory building at Abbotstown.  Planning permission for a change of use for the State laboratory has been secured and work on the building is underway.  It is expected the FAI will relocate there in the autumn.  It is also intended to provide a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport by refurbishing an existing building on the site, and preliminary planning on this project has commenced.A planning study for the Abbotstown site, which is a requirement under a local objective of the Fingal county development plan, has been completed by an inter-agency group which included the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  This study sets out the mix of sporting, leisure and amenity facilities appropriate for the site.  The planning study was considered by Fingal County Council at a meeting held on 12 March 2007 and a proposal was considered to change the zoning of a large portion of the site to open space to allow for sports use and for the woodland area of the site to be zoned for high amenity use.  The statutory public consultation period for the proposal for rezoning is due for decision at the meeting of Fingal County Council on 9 July.Under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006, the National Sports Campus Development Authority was established on a statutory basis in January to succeed in function and responsibility Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company Ltd.  In addition to overseeing the development of phase one of the campus, the new authority has been requested to identify the facilities that might be considered for the next phase of the development of the Abbotstown project.  When completed, the Abbotstown facilities will provide a much needed range of training and competitive facilities for our finest sportspersons.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Abbotstown is of major significance for our national athletes.  How many sports organisations will have their headquarters in Abbotstown?  I believe 30 organisations were to be facilitated, but I would like to know what has been done.  The capacity of the stadium created many problems along the way.  Is it still to be 50,000?  Also, did the Minister indicate the organisation that will determine the second phase or will submissions be sought from the various groups interested in having a facility at Abbotstown?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	320	As I said, the FAI is moving there in the autumn.  That building is being renovated.  The headquarters of the institute of sport are located there also.  In due course discussions will be completed with other organisations to determine their intentions.  I plan to visit the area in the next few weeks if possible to see the situation for myself and be satisfied as to future developments on the site.  There are a number of options, as the Deputy is aware.  The National Sports Campus Development Authority is to bring forward proposals for further phases of the campus.  Possible options include a 25,000 seater capacity stadium, which was mentioned in the programme for Government, a velodrome and an indoor arena.  I want to visit the location and be satisfied as to the route forward, but the NSCDA is to bring forward proposals to me for further phases of the campus and I will await them.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Many of the functions of the new campus the Minister outlined are being provided in the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick.  It may be too early to ask this question but does the Minister believe that the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick, which is now referred to as Coaching Ireland, will have less of a role to play in the future because so many of its functions will be taken over by Sports Campus Ireland?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The short answer to the last question is "No".  I do not see any reason for the National Coaching and Training Centre to be interfered with in any way by possible developments at Abbotstown.  Even on a regional basis one can see that there is good spread there.  I do not see any need to worry from the point of view of Limerick, which has done a superb job and which has the Government's full confidence in what it is able to provide for us in the future.Question No. 12 answered with QuestionNo. 10.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 26, 37, 41 and 45 together.My priorities for the development of the tourism, sport and arts and culture sectors are set out in the programme for Government.  I will formulate policies and objectives, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, to achieve the delivery of these priorities, which will be articulated further in the Department's new Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, which is in preparation and is to be completed by the end of 2007.I can say at this juncture that the overriding objectives will be to drive the development of policy with the achievement of a sustainable tourism sector and accessibility and participation for all in sport and culture areas.  Under the provisions of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Department has a total provision of some €2.7 billion in respect of both current and capital expenditure across the three sectors.  This expenditure will fund programmes such as the international marketing and product development programmes in the tourism area, the sports capital and swimming pool programmes in the sports area and the ACCESS programme in the arts-culture area.  In addition, the Department will use the NDP funding to deliver such major capital projects as the national convention centre, the new Lansdowne Road stadium, the Abbotstown campus project, the new national theatre and the new National Concert Hall.Specifically in relation to tourism, the general priorities as of now are to ensure that tourism has increasing public recognition as a key economic sector; the tourism agenda is accommodated in the relevant policies and programmes which impact on tourism; consolidate and continue to grow sustainable tourism sectors across the island of Ireland and that this is facilitated by the Government and the Department; continue to maintain the strong partnership between the State and the tourism industry; and follow up on the actions laid out in the agreed programme for Government recently negotiated.  They would be the main priorities.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this important matter concerning Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana, County Donegal, on the Inishowen peninsula.  Scoil Mhuire is one of four secondary schools in the Inishowen peninsula.  That may sound like a lot of schools for one part of a county or constituency but the Inishowen peninsula is bigger than County Louth.  That is an indication of the geography we are dealing with and given the projected increases in population, there will be a need for the retention of these four secondary schools in their current form.Based on 2003 figures, 860 people — 60 staff and 800 students — have to work in an environment which can only cater for 600 people.  That is not appropriate from an education or a health and safety point of view.  The board of management and the principal have been lobbying for a long time to try to get an extension to this school.  A total of 25% of the students spend their time in 13 prefabricated buildings.  That is not appropriate from an education viewpoint but it is also not a satisfactory environment in terms of the ambitious new programmes the school is challenging itself with, be it in the area of technology or different types of learning.  An indication of the problem we are dealing with is the fact that some of the prefabs date back to the 1960s.The application for funding was submitted eight years ago and the school authority would like to know the stage of the project.  What is the Department of Education and Science's track in terms of the band rating it has been assigned?  The most recent figure given was 2.5, which the Minister of State will probably give me now.  I want to highlight the fact that this is an excellent school with an ambitious principal and board of management.  They want to continue with the type of learning they are engaged in, especially given that it is a disadvantaged area where they have very high retention records.  They want to be positive in terms of working with the Department.  They do not want to take a negative view.  They are willing to work closely with the Minister and the Minister of State present.I will continue to raise this issue during my time in this House.  I look forward to a favourable response from the Minister of State.  Unlike the Seanad, I realise I cannot ask a supplementary question in this House.  I see the Ceann Comhairle's head nodding in agreement with me.  There was great flexibility in the Seanad when it came to supplementary questions.  We do not have that facility here and I suppose I will get a prepared reply.  Irrespective of the type of process used in this House, I want the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to feed this back to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.I look forward to working with the Minister of State on this issue, to expedite it and to put in place a proper education environment for students who do not have one.  Even from a health and safety point of view, they have been compromised in the past, albeit in a small manner.  We certainly cannot compromise students or staff in terms of health and safety.  This should be expedited and treated as a matter of urgency and I look forward to a firm commitment from the Minister of State today on the matter.As I began hastily, I forgot to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, on his new position and I wish him all the best in it.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	337	At the outset, a Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you on your election as Cheann Comhairle.  I also congratulate Deputy McHugh on his election to the Dáil.I thank Deputy McHugh for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding the development of education provision in Scoil Mhuire, Buncrana, County Donegal.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment, more than €540 million is to be spent on primary and post-primary school building and modernisation projects in the coming year throughout the country.  Since 1997, a total of €3 billion has been invested in school buildings and this has delivered more than 7,800 school building projects.  This further investment in excess of €540 million will build on these achievements and will focus in particular on the provision of school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of our commitment, national development plan funding of €4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.I am sure the Deputy will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring that school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.  In addition, to reduce red tape and allow projects to move faster, responsibility for smaller projects has been devolved to school level.  Standard designs have also been developed for eight and 16 classroom schools to facilitate speedier delivery of projects and save on design fees.  The design and build method is also used to expedite delivery where the use of standard designs is not possible.  Taken together with the unprecedented level of funding available, these initiatives ensure that building projects are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.Scoil Mhuire Secondary School, Buncrana, is a co-educational post-primary school, with a current enrolment of 622 pupils.  Enrolment trends in recent years at Scoil Mhuire have necessitated a review by my Department of demographic trends and housing developments in the area to ensure that any capital funding provided will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school's need into the future.The Department is currently preparing the long-term projected enrolment on which the school's accommodation needs will be based and will shortly notify the school of same.  The building project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter which allows me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position on Scoil Mhuire, Buncrana.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter relating to Kilcredan national school.  I am sure the Minister of State has a note on it.Next September the school will have an average class size of more than 30 students and I am sure everyone agrees that this is not sustainable.  Some of the classes will have 36, 37 or possibly 38 students.  It is not right to have a junior infants class with such numbers and it flies in the face of every educational philosophy and good practice out there.On 30 September 2006 the enrolment was 227.  Some 205 is the number required for eight mainstream class teachers.  The projected enrolment for next September is 247.  The number required to qualify for a ninth mainstream teacher is 232 on 30 September 2006.This practice of looking at the numbers of the previous September is antiquated and daft, especially when there is such a large increase in the course of the year.  The school was five pupils short, yet during the year it accepted nine extra children, five of whom were from outside the country.  In September the school will have 36 in junior infants, 24 in senior infants and 27 in both fourth class and fifth class.  Other Ministers in the House who were primary teachers will see that this is not right.This was an amalgamated school, which had it not amalgamated, would have been three separate schools.  The schools agreed and co-operated with the Department and came together as one, and they have lost out as a result.The students and the teachers are suffering.  I know that the appeals board has turned them down and that the Minister will tell me that.  That is daft as well.  We need to look at the future of our pupils.  If they fall behind at an early age, as teachers here will be aware, it is difficult for them to catch up.  Having 37 or 40 junior infants in a class is not sustainable.  It is daft.  The Government has been saying the average class size should be 24 and here is a practical example of where the average class size is over 30.  That cannot continue.I do not know what the Minister of State can do about it.  I hope he can do something, that he will not merely wring his hands and state that we must adhere to the decision of the appeals board which is independent.  I do not accept that.  We must change the rules so that in cases like this there can be more flexibility built into the system and extra teachers appointed when they are needed for the sake of the pupils.  The situation is akin to sardines in tins.I look forward with some, although not much, hope to the Minister of State's reply.  I ask him to give me a commitment to look at this again or at least to look at the entire system again because it is just not working in its current guise.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment today.  I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the position regarding this school.The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to the Department by the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2005 was 229 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule, Circular 0023/2006, which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006-07 school year is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers.The enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 227 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule, Circular 0020/2007, which is available on the Department's website and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007-08 school year will be a principal and eight mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in circular 0024/2007, which is available on the Department's website.  Hard copies of this circular were issued to primary schools.The school referred to lodged an appeal with the primary staffing appeal board.  This appeal was heard at the appeal board meeting on 22 May 2007 and was refused.  The board of management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the appeal board on 24 May 2007.  The appeal board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I am pleased to see the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, but I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not here to hear this important debate.  Perhaps he has other engagements — I was often in that impasse and understand why one must cut one's cloth according to what one has.I hope the Minister of State can ad lib as well as stating what he was told by the Department.  A sinister development has taken place.  It has become a fait accompli that the water to supply the east coast, or the greater Dublin area as it is called in friendly fashion, will come from the Shannon catchment area and Lough Ree.  Before we sleepwalk into a disaster brought upon ourselves, let us examine the facts.  There was no consultation on this frightening proposal.  The EU framework directive of 2000 stated that a guiding tenet was full consultation with interested parties.  Other options for supplying water have been dismissed blithely in cavalier fashion, leading to the conclusion that the only option is to abstract water from the Shannon and Lough Ree.  The Minister of State’s county, County Clare, will be affected, as will counties Tipperary, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath, but the main abstraction will be from the Shannon area around Athlone and Lough Ree.  Grave disquiet is building about the way the proposal flouts the framework directive in an obvious fashion.Dublin has everything, including the Luas and other facilities.  Now  it is proposing to take our water and leave us in an arid situation, like a desert.  Flippant remarks have been made to the effect that people from the region are always talking about flooding.  We do not wish the source of tourism and our natural heritage to be taken away.  The low-lying meadows in the callows around Athlone are in a special area of conservation.  Nevertheless, if the Ceann Comhairle will excuse the pun, this status will be ditched in favour of the rape of our water.  The constant leakage of Dublin water will not be corrected and, in a cavalier fashion, our water will be taken.Other proposals have been ditched.  The aquifer, which could supply a viable amount of water for daily consumption in the Dublin region, is about to have a huge landfill dump built upon it.  It will be the largest in Europe, built on top of the source of the aquifer.  When people wake up and suggest examining the aquifer, it will be too late.The desalination proposal, carried out successfully in Spain and Portugal, is not considered because of high energy costs.  That is a load of bilge that I totally debunk.  This is a serious matter.  Dublin City Council should get its hands off our water, which we need for our purposes, including recreational, ecological and environmental reasons.  We have already fought the battle about the special area of conservation.  We have come to make our peace with those who require special areas of conservation.  Europe regards them as very important.How far has this process gone?  There was no consultation with elected representatives, sporting and tourism interests or the local population.  It is a case of uisce faoi thalamh, if another pun can be permitted.  Perhaps county managers have come together to decide this is the way forward and that water is only for ordinary people and not very important.  I hope the Minister of State can confirm that all options are being considered.  Otherwise, I will continue this crusade for a long time.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	345	This important matter is of interest to many people in the Shannon region and beyond.  The Minister, who regrets he is not available this evening, explained to the House yesterday in response to a written question that the Department had provided the funding to Dublin City Council for a study to assess the long-term water use and supply needs of the greater Dublin area and to identify potential options for meeting those needs.  The Shannon proposal was one of the options that emanated from the study.  It is no more than a study option and there is no related infrastructural proposal before the Department for consideration or approval.This Department is responsible for planning, prioritising and financing all of the major water services projects undertaken nationally.  Every effort has been made over the past few years to ensure that water and sewerage facilities have been available to service and support the huge growth and expansion that has taken place across all economic and social sectors.  Schemes approved by this Department are incorporated into the water services investment programme, a published document that is always available in the Oireachtas Library.  The approved schemes are drawn from regular assessments of needs undertaken by local authorities, at this Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for providing infrastructure needed to meet environmental protection objectives, development requirements and national and EU public health and water quality standards.  It was in that context that the particular study I have referred to was funded.  However, there is no scheme in the programme to provide infrastructure to take water from the Shannon to Dublin.Nevertheless, new long-term supplies of water are required in the greater Dublin area.  There is limited potential to abstract additional water from existing sources in the area and it is necessary to consider new long-term options.  That was the background to the study which estimated that an extra 300 million litres of water per day will be required from a new major source by 2031.  The study concluded that only two options could technically meet this requirement, the Shannon or a desalination plant.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I am only able to speak one sentence at a time.  I will come to that.  Dublin City Council is now carrying out a detailed appraisal of the Shannon and desalination options to determine which, if either, would represent the optimum solution to the region's long-term water needs.  The appraisal is just that, an appraisal, and no decision has been taken, at either local or departmental level, as to what might be the best answer.Any decision to proceed with the Shannon approach would first be subject to statutory procedures, including strategic environmental assessment.  The statutory process provides an opportunity for all interested parties to make an input.  I am well aware people on the Shannon have expressed concerns that there may be adverse consequences due to lowered water levels in the river.  Others have said ground water resources could be exploited instead.  All these issues remain to be fully teased out as part of the statutory process associated with the decision making on a preferred approach.It will be clear from the foregoing that it will be some time before any proposal is likely to come before the Department for approval or funding.  I assure Deputies that I, and the Department, are just as keen as the people around Lough Ree to preserve and protect the lake.  It is crucial to the livelihoods of many individuals and businesses and has high amenity value for people engaged in a range of pursuits.  I assure the House that before the Department would commit to funding any scheme on the Shannon, we would need to be absolutely convinced that all those factors had been taken into account and that it was the correct solution from every point of view.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I wish to speak on this Adjournment debate to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need to conduct a feasibility study into making my county town, Carlow, the first green energy town in Ireland, in order to advance the implementation of the targets set out in the national bioenergy action plan.This is especially important in light of the need for an indigenous fuel supply, concerns with peak oil, the consequences of climate change, and the need to meet our Kyoto targets.  The national bioenergy plan has an ambitious target of 33% for renewable electricity by 2020.  It sets a bio-fuel target of 5.75% for road transport fuel for 2010, and a target of 5% renewable share in the heating sector by 2010.My home county town of Carlow is ideally placed to establish itself as the leader in renewable energy among towns across Ireland.  I call upon the Government to initiate a feasibility study to explore the possibility of developing local value chains for renewable energy systems on how to heat large buildings in Carlow by biomass and by using microgrids connecting buildings that are close to each other, and in using district heating systems.  Using these methods, Carlow could become a renewable energy town linking in to local energy resources to develop biomass and other projects.  In so doing, Carlow, in tandem with public private partnerships, could attract many new businesses and become the giant of the renewable energy sector in Ireland.By leading the field in this vital sector of renewable energy, it could create sustainable employment and numerous new renewable energy enterprises.  This format could allow Carlow to work towards being totally self-sufficient in renewable energy, renewable heat and liquid bio-fuels generated from local sources.  This is particularly important in the light of the recent closure of the Carlow sugar factory and could give enormous competitive advantage to farmers in Carlow and the wider area of the south east to grow energy crops for bio-fuel and biomass.The county has a skilled workforce and with forward planning, in tandem with the extensive research facilities at Oak Park where Teagasc has its headquarters, this could develop many new business enterprises allowing the town to offer incoming businesses a most attractive package of reduced energy costs.This innovative idea is not something I have dreamed up myself.  It has been pioneered in Austria in the town of Gussing.  This town was located in one of the poorest regions of Austria but it has now become one of the wealthiest.  Carlow has a tremendous opportunity to replicate this success.  In 1988 the municipality of Gussing set a goal to replace its €1.3 million spend on imports of oil, electricity and other fuels with renewable energy supplies from locally available resources.  This is something I want Carlow to be able to do.  In 1990 a decision was made to fully phase out fossil fuel.  Today, Gussing is an autonomous renewable energy city for electricity and heating needs.  The needs of Carlow could be met by growing our energy crops and by having a good vision for renewable energy in the south east.  Carlow, with its excellent road network, good rail infrastructure and its vibrant and dynamic workforce simply needs a kick-start from the Government in the area of renewable energy technology.Carlow has recently experienced job losses in Lapple Ireland Limited, Irish Sugar and other businesses.  Our proud county town is eager to commit to renewable energy technologies and with our extensive land bank, expert agricultural sector and supportive local authority with its own dynamic bioenergy programme, in tandem with Teagasc, I put forward this concept that Carlow, the second smallest county in Ireland could become a giant of the renewable energy sector.  I call upon the Government to initiate this feasibility study to promote the concept of Carlow as a green energy town, in the national interest.In my five-year term in the Dáil, I will press this agenda hard and wholeheartedly in the hope the Government can come up with a resolution to my idea.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I welcome Deputy White to the House and compliment her on her contribution.The development of Ireland's bioenergy sector is part of a comprehensive strategy to increase deployment of renewable energy across the three energy sectors — transport, heat and electricity.  These sectors are almost equal in the amount of energy they use and their CO2 emissions.Bioenergy policy is relevant across several areas of Government responsibility and has potential benefits across a variety of diverse areas.  It addresses several cross-cutting policy objectives, including diversity and security of fuel supply, climate change, development of the rural economy, and enhancing competitiveness through the provision of cleaner, cheaper energy.The development of our bioenergy resources thus requires an integrated "whole of Government" approach to policy development.  In recognition of the complexities of the bioenergy challenge, a ministerial task force on bioenergy was established in 2006.  Seven  Departments were represented on the ministerial task force, reflecting the priority afforded to this area by Government.The action plan sets out ambitious targets for the deployment of bioenergy in the heat, transport and electricity sectors.  The targets are established to 2020, to provide a level of market certainty for prospective developers.  A range of deployment strategies across several Departments was identified in the action plan, many of which are already being implemented.The public sector, in particular, has been singled out to act as an exemplar for bioenergy deployment.  The OPW has committed to using bioenergy in all new buildings, and to retrofitting 20 of its large buildings with bioenergy heating systems within the next 12 months.  Schools too are to be targeted, with eight schools receiving funding to install bioenergy heating systems this summer, with a view to providing models that can be replicated in other schools.Renewable energy will also be given increased emphasis in the leasing of buildings for the public sector, and energy efficiency programmes are to be introduced.  In the transport area, the Government aims to use bio-fuel blends of 5% in its existing CIE and local authority fleets and to move towards 30% bio-fuel blends in new fleets, where possible.In the past two years a range of renewable energy support programmes, including the greener homes domestic grants, reheat grants and CHP deployment programmes, valued at more than €400 million, has been introduced.  The programmes are designed to be accessible to all energy users around the country, from householders, to community and voluntary groups, the commercial and industrial sector and renewable electricity producers.  Funding of up to 40% is available under the reheat programme for organisations wishing to examine the feasibility of utilising the technologies funded under the programme.  Grants have been made available to applicants in County Carlow under the greener homes and the reheat schemes.  In addition, funding has also been provided to a developer in County Carlow under the house of tomorrow programme towards the development of 56 low energy design housing units.  These programmes are backed up by strong investment in energy research and development, as well as the €10 million Power of One energy efficiency campaign.In reaching out across all sectors of society, the renewable energy policy and this biomass action plan, which I stress is a national plan, empowers everyone to play their part in a cleaner and more competitive environment.  The adoption of a "whole of Government" approach to this challenge will ensure its ability to maximise the national benefit of these policies.The renewable electricity, heat and transport programmes offer a range of new opportunities for farmers and foresters.  The action plan recognises the need to develop the entire supply chain, from producer to energy end-user and a range of schemes have been introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to incentivise energy crop production.  The forestry machinery grants, bio-energy establishment scheme and top-up payment to the energy crop premium are proving popular and are designed to mitigate perceived risks and encourage investment in energy-related farm and forest businesses.The action plan sets the scene for the establishment of new rural enterprises using raw materials that previously may not have had any value.  Forest residues and thinnings, as well as dedicated energy crops and farm wastes, all provide new opportunities, while wastes such as used cooking oil and meat and bone meal that incurred disposal costs can now be converted into bio-fuels for transport or used to generate electricity.The bio-fuels sector has seen a sharp rise in activity and interest in recent years and the Government has established ambitious targets in line with EU thinking.  It aims to create a level of long-term certainty for potential investors through the establishment of targets for 2010 and 2020 and the announcement of the intention to move to a bio-fuels obligation.  The Government intends to launch a public consultation process on Ireland's bio-fuels obligation later this year, which will give stakeholders an opportunity to have an input to the roll-out of this important policy initiative.The action plan is a valuable first step in recognising the complexities of the bio-energy supply chain and providing cross-departmental support for development of bio-energy in Ireland.  Together with the publication of the White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, and the revised national climate change strategy, the Government has set an ambitious agenda for change.The input of producers, processors and consumers will be a valuable part of the process to deliver the necessary changes and the Government will continue to engage with the various sectors and the diverse range of stakeholders on the roll-out of schemes and initiatives to incentivise production and demand.  The Government will be glad to consider any proposals put forward by groups or individuals that would contribute to its aim.  Deputy White's proposal will be considered and examined in that context.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Following Ireland's successful hosting of the Ryder Cup in September of last year, Fáilte Ireland, in conjunction with the PGA / European Tour, commissioned Deloitte and Touche, Consultants, to conduct an economic impact assessment on the Ryder Cup in Ireland.   According to the Report, the findings of which were announced in April last, the 2006 Ryder Cup was worth a record €143 million to the Irish economy.  This total direct economic impact figure of €143 million exceeded pre-event predictions of €130 million and represented a significant 32% increase on the impact of the 2002 Ryder Cup in England and an 80% increase on that of the 1997 Ryder Cup in Spain. It also, I understand, excluded the "downstream" effect of the additional expenditure generated by The Ryder Cup, where direct spending is recycled through the economy, bringing further benefit. By applying carefully selected economic models, Deloitte calculated that when this effect is taken into account, the full impact of the 2006 Ryder Cup on the Irish Economy was around €240 million. However, not only did the Report provide welcome confirmation that the total economic benefit of the event to the economy comfortably exceeded earlier estimates, it also confirmed previously reported perceptions about our visitors' experience, with over 80% suggesting that they would return to Ireland in the future and 92% prepared to recommend Ireland as a golfing holiday destination. The challenge now for our tourism agencies and for the industry generally is to build on that positive outcome and to ensure that the legacy of the Ryder Cup 2006 is secured for the benefit of Irish tourism.

In total, since 1998, capital funding of €568 million has been allocated in respect of 6,716 projects all over Ireland, as well as several major infrastructure projects.  One of the stated objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities.  In keeping with Government policy, allocations under the programme reflect special priority for the development of sports and recreational facilities in areas designated as disadvantaged i.e. RAPID, CLÁR and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  My Department liaises closely with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pobal and Local Authorities with regard to continuing to prioritise applications for sports capital funding from areas designated by Government as disadvantaged.I am pleased to say that in the period 2003 to 2007 almost €152 million has been allocated through the sports capital programme towards the provision of a wide variety of indoor and outdoor multi-purpose and sport specific facilities in disadvantaged areas which are providing excellent opportunities for people of all ages in the communities concerned to participate in sport and physical recreation in modern top class facilities and in positive social environments.  In addition, my Department's National Sports Facility Strategy will help identify any gaps in provision and will assist in the targeting, support and funding of areas of greatest need including those people experiencing social and economic disadvantage.Through my Department special funding of €1.98 million has been allocated from the dormant account funds this year for projects that are increasing participation in sports and recreation in disadvantaged areas.  This investment is having a positive impact on the lives of young people in disadvantaged areas. In total 781 worthwhile projects throughout the country are benefiting from grants ranging from €500 to €10,000.  A variety of sporting and recreation activities for disadvantaged young people are being supported including funding for coaching, training, purchase of equipment, hire of facilities and outings to activity centres.The funding is being distributed through 33 Local Sports Partnerships and Local Authorities, where no Local Sports Partnership currently exists, whose knowledge and expertise was called upon in identifying worthy projects throughout the country.

Phase One is being carried out within my Department and will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities. The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  This National Sports Facility Strategy will aim to: increase opportunities among people of all ages to participate in sport; increase rates of participation in sport among people of all ages; and improve performance levels through access to appropriate facilities.A key objective in relation to the preparation of the National Sports Facility Strategy is to ensure consistency "on a nationwide basis" in relation to the completion of the audit facility so that inter-regional planning can be undertaken.  With this in mind, the preparation of a guidance pack and survey/audit toolkit for use by Local Authorities and / or Local Sports Partnerships to assist them in carrying out local audit has been prioritised as part of the Sports Facility Strategy.  This element of the strategy will greatly help in the completion of the audit.

This was an unprecedented achievement for the Irish Cricket Team.The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing funding to sporting clubs, voluntary and community organisations towards the provision of sporting facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.  All applications received are evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.I am aware of the wish of the Irish Cricket Union to develop a new ground for cricket in Ireland. In this connection I understand that the Irish Cricket Union has established a committee, chaired by the President of the Union, to draw up proposals and make recommendations in relation to the establishment of this facility.  I look forward to receiving these proposals in due course.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	359	The National Concert Hall, within its limited space at Earlsfort Terrace, is highly energetic and operates with a strong commercial market focus. Seat occupancy consistently exceeds 80% with patrons being turned away from many "house full" events.The Government has decided to redevelop the Concert Hall which will incorporate a main auditorium with a seating capacity for 2,000 patrons, the existing auditorium, which will be retained as a rehearsal hall and a mid-scale public performance space, and a smaller flexible hall.  This three-hall configuration will enable the National Concert Hall to provide for public demand including the staging of key performances by top-class world artistes at reasonable ticket prices.The redeveloped Concert Hall will meet the requirement for universal access.  Furthermore, the proposal incorporates easy access for large articulated trucks transporting orchestral and concert equipment.  It is envisaged that the Earlsfort Terrace buildings would be re-united with the Iveagh Gardens, facilitating increased public access and new public rooms, cafes and restaurants would over-look the Gardens and the city.Contracts for the purchase of the interest of University College Dublin in the Earlsfort Terrace site were executed on 20 September, 2006.  University College Dublin has already transferred some of its personnel and functions to Belfield and will decant from the remainder in 2007.  A lease back arrangement has been put in place by OPW with the college until late 2007, by which time the college will have fully vacated the premises.In accordance with the decision of the Government, the redeveloped National Concert Hall will be a Design Build Finance Maintain type Public Private Partnership project.  It is being overseen by an Interagency Steering Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. This committee includes the Chairman of the Office of Public Works, the Chairman of the Board of the National Concert Hall, the Manager of Dublin City Council, a representative of the National Development Finance Agency, and the Assistant Secretary of my Department with responsibility for the Arts and Culture brief.  The Director of the National Concert Hall also attends the meetings of the Steering Committee. My Department provides the Secretariat to the Committee.The task of the Interagency Steering Committee, in general terms, is to oversee the procurement, negotiation and construction phases of the design/build/finance/maintain PPP for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall, in compliance with relevant Department of Finance Guidelines and in adherence to the terms of the Government Decisions germane to the project, and to realise the vision set for the project.  A Project Committee has been established to progress the detailed work. The accommodation brief for the redeveloped National Concert Hall has been approved by the Steering Committee.  The Process Auditor and legal advisors have been engaged. The procedures required to engage financial and technical expertise to carry this project forward are under way at present.  These advisors will play an important role in carrying out the very extensive work which has to be completed prior to the seeking of tenders for the PPP project.I look forward to this project progressing speedily and officially through the PPP process so that Dublin will have a Concert Hall which will be on a par with leading concert halls in capital cities throughout Europe and which will enable the current and expanding market demand for musical entertainment to be met.

The purpose of the Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill is to provide for the granting of powers to the Irish Sports Council to establish subsidiary companies which will facilitate the establishment of the Irish Institute of Sport and Coaching Ireland. The Bord na gCon (Amendment) Bill is intended to give effect to the recommendations of the recent "Dalton" Report into certain matters affecting Bord na gCon. The Bill deals with the reconfiguration of the Board, with particular reference to the number and tenure of ordinary Board members and the tenure of the Chairman, and the need to separate regulatory functions from promotional functions, both of which are now the responsibility of Bord na gCon. I hope to publish these Bills later this year.

The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  Thereafter, following consideration of the recommendations in the Review, it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a provision of  €184m in the National Development Plan, 2007-2013 in respect of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Ireland offers a unique racing experience to the race going public both at home and abroad.  I am satisfied that Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), in close collaboration with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, is very much engaged in marketing that unique experience internationally.HRI, as the national authority for racing, includes within its remit, the representation of Irish racing abroad.  Through its board, its senior executives and its international marketing subsidiary, Irish Thoroughbred Marketing, it promotes and enhances the reputation of the Irish thoroughbred industry internationally.  HRI's five year Strategic Plan specifically prioritises the development and promotion of Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding and I have every confidence that they are committing the necessary resources to that task.I am aware that HRI carries out extensive promotion of Irish racing in the UK and works in close collaboration with Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in this regard.  My Department has encouraged synergies between the bodies and the parties now meet on a regular basis and work on a number of joint strategies for the UK market.  Their combined trade stand at the Cheltenham meetings in November and March, promotes racing at all Irish racecourses and assists British racegoers in planning their visits to Ireland.  The Irish Racing Festivals are particularly popular and the Punchestown Festival, in particular, is proving a major attraction for UK racegoers.  Recent independent research carried out by NUI Maynooth indicated that almost 20% of the attendances at Punchestown Festival are from the UK.Following the success of these initiatives in recent years, HRI and Fáilte Ireland have recently agreed on an additional joint programme to promote racing in Ireland in September.  This is a unique month in Irish racing, providing a full spectrum of the racing experience from small local meetings to world-class contests including Laytown, Leopardstown, Galway, the Curragh and Listowel.  It has been identified as an ideal opportunity to showcase Irish racing to a UK audience.I also understand that HRI has invested significantly in upgrading its website, providing comprehensive information on all 27 Irish racecourses.  Visitors to the website can also register to receive a weekly newsletter on Irish racing and copies of HRI publications such as the ‘Courses for Horses' booklet, which includes recommendations on places to stay and things to do while attending any of Ireland's racecourses.  The website is the most important point of contact between Irish racing and the international market and currently attracts some 150,000 visits per month.This is a golden era for Irish racing, given the level of success achieved by our horses, trainers and jockeys, both at home and abroad which has contributed to the growing international reputation of Ireland as a world leader in the industry.  I am confident that the combined expertise of the agencies will produce the right result for horseracing and for tourism and that the level of attendees from abroad, currently in the region of 70,000, can be increased.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 28 and 34 together.As the House is aware, in January 2004, the Government agreed to provide funding of €191m towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road Stadium as a 50,000 capacity all-seater state-of-the-art facility. The decision in March last by An Bord Pleanála to grant permission for the project cleared the way for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road to commence. The Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company commenced the demolition of the old stadium in May 2007. The estimated construction period is approximately 29 months and the new stadium should be ready by late 2009 or early 2010.There are legal disputes regarding the project involving some residents and the I.R.F.U., and I am informed that these have recently been referred to the Commercial Court for adjudication. I am precluded from further specific comment while these matters are before the courts.  However I understand that the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company has been engaged in a sustained consultative process with local residents and other bodies in fully understanding and taking on board real concerns to the greatest extent possible.In common with any construction project, I am informed that there may be minor design revisions identified as requiring the seeking of fresh planning permissions but the Deputy will understand that is a matter entirely for the Development Company working within the relevant Planning Acts. I hope the Deputy will appreciate too, that, while specific tender processes are still in train, it would not be appropriate to comment on the budgeting aspects of the project.In relation to the tender process I am informed by the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company that the procurement process involves the inviting of tenders for a number of packages. The packages are in relation to Demolition and Rail, Substructure, Steel, Main Contract, Mechanical, Electrical, Cladding, Pitch. Contracts for the first three packages have been awarded and the procurement process is in train for the remaining contracts. It is planned that all of the tender process will have been completed before the end of this year. I understand that so far there has been a good response to initial invitations to tender.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Deputies will be aware that the National Sports Campus Development Authority has taken over the role and function of CSID since 1 January 2007. A fully owned subsidiary of the Authority, NSCDA (Operations) Ltd., is now operating the National Aquatic Centre. A full "health check" has been carried out on the National Aquatic Centre since it came back into the possession of CSID on 1 December 2006. This was done under the supervision of Kavanagh Mansfield & Partners, Consulting Structural and Civil Engineers. I understand that the NSCDA has received a report from Kavanagh Mansfield & Partners and is being considered by the Authority in consultation with its technical advisors.The necessary repair works to restore the Centre to its original working standard have been ongoing since it came back into the possession of the Authority. These repairs are being overseen by Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners and have been taking place in conjunction with the overall "health check". To date approximately €490,000 has been expended on remediation work. I am sure Deputies will agree with me that this is a wonderful facility which has been through and survived a difficult time over the past few years. I would invite Deputies to come and see the Centre for themselves and I look forward to their support for this key piece of our sporting infrastructure.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The National Development Plan's Tourism Development Programme, which provides for an €800m Exchequer investment in tourism over the next 7 years, has as one of its fundamental objectives the stimulation of regional development.  The Programme includes an "International Marketing" sub-programme which provides €335m to promote the island of Ireland in key international markets. The key objective over the seven years will be to increase tourism revenue and visitor yield and to help achieve a wider regional and seasonal distribution of business; Product Development and Infrastructure sub-programme funding of €317m, part of which will be used to support the delivery of Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Product Development Strategy for the period 2007-2013.  In rolling out programmes and initiatives under this Strategy, special regard will be paid to the need for integrated regional development; a Training and Human Resource Development Sub-Programme, which will invest €148m in the education and training of the tourism workforce, including the continuation of initiatives aimed at improving management capability and networking in SMEs and micro-enterprises at regional level. In addition; other tourism investment opportunities under the new NDP, for example the proposed new Gateway Innovation Fund, the Rural Social and Economic Development Programme, and the Built and Natural Heritage Sub-Programmes, also have a strong regional and rural dimension. I believe that the major reform of tourism structures that has been completed in the last year or so will contribute to the regional development objective and will help to optimise the benefits of tourism in the regions.  As the Deputy will be aware, five new Regional Tourism Development Boards were established in 2006.  These boards are now preparing strategies for their respective regions and their key priority is to ensure a greater focus on the individual needs of each region at a national level and the direct involvement of the region in the development of national policy and tourism strategy.  These new regional tourism structures will also be an important resource available to the various spending agencies in optimising the tourism benefits of their investment under the National Development Plan, thereby adding to the social and economic impact locally of such spending.Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that there are a number of other initiatives "day-to-day responsibilities of the tourism State agencies" that particularly favour the regional distribution of tourists. These include Fáilte Ireland's Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative; the use of predominantly rural imagery in the advertising and promotion of Ireland, both at home and abroad; the regional coverage with respect to visiting media; and the specific focus on achieving a wide spread of visitors in relation to access transport policies.

The GAA has been requested to submit a proposal which would be in line with that position.  Responsibility for player welfare issues rests with the GAA in the same manner as similar player welfare issues in other sports must be dealt with by the responsible National Governing Body of Sport.I am prepared to consider any proposal from the GAA that would be satisfactory to both the GAA and the GPA and in line with Government policy.  I have recently received a request from Cumann Luthchleas Gael for a meeting to discuss this matter and I will be responding in due course.  My Department responded to the GAA on 9 May noting the GAA's position but stating that the position remains as outlined above.  My Department remains available to meet with both organisations to assist in developing a proposal that would be satisfactory to both the GAA and the GPA.

However, the Arts Council does not provide funding for private, commercial arts organisations such as private galleries.  My Department provides capital funding through the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS) for the building of arts and culture facilities around the country, mainly in the not-for-profit sector.  Likewise, commercial organisations are not normally funded unless they fill a clear gap in the public arts and culture infrastructure needs of their area.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Some 155 applications were received seeking funding of over €200m under the recently completed round of the Arts & Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS II).  This demand greatly exceeded the total funding of €32m available for disbursement under this round of the scheme.  An independent Selection Committee, appointed to evaluate all the applications received, made funding recommendations based on the criteria set out when the scheme was announced.The standard of the proposals received was high and, while funding has been offered to 62 organisations, aimed at developing the arts and culture infrastructure around the country over the years 2007 to 2009, the Deputy will appreciate that difficult decisions had to be made and it was not possible to provide funding immediately to many very worthwhile projects, including this one.  All deferred applications will be retained on file, however, and will be considered further should additional funding become available, subject to them meeting the scheme criteria.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	370	As the Deputy is aware, my Department was designated under the Government's Decentralisation Programme as one of the "early mover" Departments.  It is intended that the entire Department (excluding the National Archives which will remain in Dublin) will relocate to Killarney.  Following a tendering process, the Office of Public Works selected PJ Hegarty and Sons to develop the permanent building for the Department's headquarters in Killarney. The construction of the new building in Killarney commenced in May this year and the anticipated completion date is September 2008. Allowing for fit out the premises should be ready for occupation late in 2008.Currently an advance group of 49 members of staff has been relocated to temporary accommodation at Fossa, Killarney.  My Department is now planning to transfer a further group of 21 staff to Fossa later this month. The temporary premises is capable of accommodating up to 70 staff.

In that context the potential for co-operation across the horse and greyhound sectors will be explored building on contacts which have already been made in these areas and at future Ministerial meetings.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The task of attracting international production into Ireland is dependent on a number of elements, not all of which fall within the sphere of influence of my Department or that of the Irish Film Board (IFB).  Decisions to site a film project in a particular territory involve complex funding, cultural, logistical and project-specific elements all of which are crucial for a successful result.Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board. This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.My Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the section 481 tax relief scheme. The scheme is kept under review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any necessary amendments to retain or regain competitiveness will be addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate. In that regard, the Department of Finance in conjunction with my Department and the Irish Film Board, is currently undertaking a review of the case for improvement in respect of the section 481 scheme. Consultants have been appointed by the Department of Finance and it is envisaged that the study will identify a structured way forward to develop and consolidate the Irish film industry, taking account of the serious international competition issues now apparent.The Irish Film Board with its overall funding for 2007 increased to €19.7m will be able to continue with its key role of developing and supporting film production in Ireland. The increased current allocation will facilitate the Irish Film Board in marketing Ireland as a film location and, in particular, will assist the work of the Film Commissioner in Los Angeles in raising the profile of the Irish audiovisual industry abroad.The continuing increases in capital funding to the Irish Film Board since 2004 have ensured support to meet the demands of the industry in the areas of project and talent development, training and indigenous film and television production.  The increased support enables the IFB to fulfil its aim of sustained growth of the industry — increasing the number and quality of films produced in Ireland each year.  In aggregate, since 2002 the film and TV production spend in Ireland, supported by the Irish Film Board and section 481, has approached almost €500m.

The publication of the report is a matter for the Arts Council.  In advance of my considering its proposals fully and discussing them with my colleague, the Minister for Education, it would be premature of me to comment further at this juncture.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The issue of pay for any sector of the economy is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, I can, of course, comment on the research, The Public and the Arts, carried out by the Arts Council.  The recent study does not show diminishing engagement with the arts. On the contrary the research confirms that levels of attendance at arts events in Ireland are above international norms.  The report noted a drop in figures in certain areas of the arts compared with activities and behaviours that prevailed in 1994.  However, the ways in which audiences are engaging with the arts are rapidly changing and expanding — particularly in the intervening 10 years.Significantly, research findings in The Public and the Arts also highlighted the increased way in which audiences experience the arts through the broadcast and new media.  The traditional models of experiencing the arts — of going to the theatre or a gallery, are being augmented by newer modes and the use of new media — including podcasting and downloading — is having a major impact on the way in which people now engage with the arts.  This is particularly evident, though not exclusively so, among younger generations.The Arts Council has established an Audience Project in response to the findings of The Public and the Arts Study to design and implement programmes which expand the definition of audience and which take cognisance of current trends within a wider cultural sphere.  These will address emerging audience patterns and enhance the capacity of arts organisations and that of existing and new partners to engage with a range of audiences across multiple platforms.The Arts Council has also undertaken a touring initiative in order to extend and enhance opportunities for audiences to see work across a range of art forms, particularly regionally.  The Council is working closely with arts organisations on this initiative and audience research that is happening in parallel will inform my policies in this area into the future.  This Government is fully committed to supporting the Arts and this year the Arts Council received €80m in funding, its highest level ever. Funding for the Arts Council has increased 67% since 2003.

It is unfortunate that the matter has become embroiled in a long legal battle and it is my belief that the money and energy being spent by all sides on this judicial review would be far better employed in providing much needed sports facilities in the Tallaght area.  My hope would be that the parties involved would resolve this matter amicably and come up with a workable solution whereby sport will be the winner.  If I can be of assistance I am happy to use my good offices to try to resolve this impasse.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Overseas development policy and programmes in general are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.The White Paper on Irish Aid, published by the Government last September, outlines the challenges and opportunities for the Government's aid programme, entitled Irish Aid, over the coming years.  The White Paper, inter alia, aims to strengthen coherence in our approach to development and to make the best use of the expertise and skills available right across the public service.  In that context, many Government Departments and agencies contribute to the official aid programme directly or indirectly.The White Paper also aims to promote links between the private sectors in Ireland and in developing countries.  In that context, I have no doubt that there is, in the private sector, a considerable pool of expertise which could be usefully drawn upon to help grow sustainable tourism in developing countries where, of course, it can be a means of generating much needed private sector employment.The Tourism Agencies' role is to promote Tourism to Ireland and develop tourism within Ireland.  In the case of the Tourism Agencies, I understand that they respond willingly to requests, for information, meetings or other contacts, which can contribute to sustainable global development and to the objectives of Irish Aid, as they arise in the course of their day-to-day operations.  It should also be borne in mind that Tourism Ireland is a North South Body which is responsible to two Administrations.My Department is represented in the Inter-Departmental Committee on Development, established as set out in the White Paper and which met for the first time on 12 April 2007.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Flood Protection Works have been carried out by the Office of Public Works on the River Tolka over the past few years arising from a report prepared for Dublin City Council and part funded by OPW.A Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study [CFRAMS] of the River Dodder has recently commenced.  The Study is being managed by Dublin City Council and is funded by the Office of Public Works.  OPW has already provided funding to Dublin City Council to construct flood barriers along a portion of the river Dodder following the severe flooding event of 2002.  It is planned to commence further interim flood relief works on the Dodder shortly.A Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study of the River Liffey catchment will also be undertaken as part of a programme of such studies to be commissioned over the next few years.  A study of the River Tolka catchment, which will further develop the information already available, will also be undertaken as part of this programme.The Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Study, which was commissioned by Dublin City Council and part funded by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Transport and the Marine, which has responsibility for coastal and tidal flooding, examined the causes and impacts of flooding from Portmarnock to Booterstown.  A final draft of the report is currently being examined.The flood defence proposals contained in the draft report would have an estimated capital cost  of over €100 million.  The works recommended in the report will need to be implemented on an incremental basis over a period of years.I take it that the reference to the construction of new flood planes is to development in flood plains.  Planning and Development control is a matter for Local Authorities in the first instance and for An Bórd Pleanála in certain instances. OPW does not have a direct role in the matter.  OPW has however, issued broad guidelines for Local Authorities on the consideration of flood risk in Development plans.  The Floodmaps website developed by OPW, which carries available information on previous flood events provides a considerable amount of information, which should be useful to planners in identifying areas of potential flood risk.OPW commissioned a study earlier this year in consultation with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government and the Department Transport and the Marine, to develop more detailed policy and guidelines on flood risk management in planning and Development Plans.  This study included a public consultation, which closed on 29th June. It is envisaged that the more detailed guidance will be available in the first half of 2008.

This cannot be seen from a tax point of view in isolation.  While a couple in such circumstances may lose entitlement to the employee credit of €1,760 per annum (where the spouse who has given up work was in PAYE employment), they may gain entitlement to the home carer tax credit of €770 per annum.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, there are a range of other services and supports available from the Health Service Executive to which families or individuals with particular medical conditions and needs may be entitled.  These measures, details of which are available from the Executive, can provide real and substantial assistance to families in particular circumstances.  Also, entitlement to the married tax credit of €3,520 per annum, which is double the value of the single basic personal tax credit, would continue to apply.  The incapacitated child tax credit of €3,000 per annum, where it applies, would continue to be available.  Similarly, entitlement to medical expenses relief to the extent that it applied would be unaffected.Where a couple decide to employ a carer to assist with the child's care needs, the couple may benefit from the support provided by the "employed person taking care of an incapacitated individual allowance".  The amount which may be claimed as a deduction under this provision is the lesser of (a) the amount ultimately borne by the taxpayer in the year of assessment in employing the employed person, or (b) €50,000.  In the event that a couple chooses this approach, the incapacitated child tax credit would not apply but entitlement to medical expenses relief, to the extent that it applied, would be unaffected.

The latest meeting took place in Maputo, Mozambique and was attended by a senior official from my Department.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has made significant commitments to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. This commitment comprises both bilateral aid and aid to multilateral institutions including IDA. The Government is committed to fully participating in the business of IDA and the business of other World Bank institutions to ensure that resources are made available in an effective and timely manner to the poorest and least developed countries.As the situation in developing countries evolves and the structure and composition of aid programmes are developed in response to changes in the economy and population of recipient countries, Ireland will continue to be proactive in ensuring that the aid programmes meet the needs of the poorest populations. At the same time, Ireland will work to help ensure that the aid programmes are managed in a way that is consistent with good governance, best practice and giving assurance to tax payers of donor countries, including Ireland, that their money is used in the most efficient and effective way. The concerns voiced by NGOs, including the Debt and Development Coalition and Trócaire, will be borne in mind in that context.

It is EU law, agreed by all Member States, that defines the scope for applying a rate to a good or service. In this regard, Ireland, apart from the farmers' flat rate VAT addition, operates three rates of VAT:Zero-rate which generally applies to most food, children's clothes and shoes, and oral medicines. While it is possible to retain the zero rating for goods and services that were in place on 1 January 1991, no new zero VAT rates can be introduced;Reduced rate of 13.5 per cent which applies, for example, to hot food, cinemas and certain live animals and plants. Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the VAT Directive;Furthermore, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent, any items not listed in Annex III, provided they carried that reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These items are considered to be ‘parked' and Ireland's parked rate equates to our reduced rate of 13.5%. Domestic fuels and labour intensive services are examples of parked items.Standard rate of 21 per cent for goods or services which are not zero rated or reduced rated. Examples would include; cars, electrical equipment, motor fuels and CD/DVDs. Under the VAT Directive Member States may set the standard VAT rate not lower than 15% — there is political agreement that the standard rate of VAT applying in each Member State does not exceed 25%.The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the scope for reducing the VAT rate on environmental goods and services from the standard VAT rate of 21 per cent to the reduced rate of 13.5 per cent. This and other measures under the Programme for Government clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges which we face.

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Southern region will cover counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary South Riding.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The National Implementation Body (NIB) in its statement dated 15 May 2007 proposed a two phase approach to the claim for reduced hours for nurses/midwives.Phase 1. The NIB proposed a reduction of 1.5 hours to 37.5 hours by 1 June 2008. This reduction must be achieved on a cost neutral basis and without diminution of service to patients. There will be local engagement over the coming months on changes in rosters, skill mix and other productivity measure which could facilitate the reduction. The Health Service Performance Verification Group would validate local proposals for the reduction in hours prior to its introduction. The Health Service Executive (HSE) has prepared an action plan for the management of the Phase 1 process, setting out timelines for the implementation of the various strands.Phase 2. The NIB recommended the establishment of a Commission to produce an independent assessment of how a 35 hour week can be achieved, having regard to the issues set out in the relevant Labour Court Recommendation (No. 18763). This Commission will be chaired by an eminent person and it will have four other members, two of whom will have international expertise. The Commission will be expected to report within six months. I will shortly be bringing proposals before Cabinet for the establishment of the Commission recommended by the NIB.

It would not be administratively feasible for the HSE to contact every person currently in a private nursing home.After the new nursing home support scheme — A Fair Deal — was announced in December 2006, leaflets giving details of the new scheme, and also giving information about the increased subvention payments for 2007, were distributed to Local Health Offices. This information, as well as the new National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme, was also made available on the HSE website. The leaflet advised that anyone currently in a private nursing home, or planning to enter a private nursing home, should contact their Local Health Office to apply for a subvention or an increased subvention.In accordance with the National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme, the HSE will cease imputing income from the principal private residence where it has already been taken into account for three or more years. This change is consistent with A Fair Deal. However, it would not be possible to apply this retrospectively as to do so would be unfair to all those who have already been assessed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive, together.Under the Minimum Benefit Regulations all insurance products that provide cover for in-patient hospital treatment must provide a certain minimum level of benefits. The 1999 Government White Paper on Health Insurance stated that the purpose of the Minimum Benefit Regulations is: to maintain inter-generational solidarity within the community rating system; to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital care cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population; and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure due to lack of proper understanding of the restrictions which, in the absence of a specified minimum entitlement, could apply to some types of policies.The minimum benefit regulations, having regard to psychiatric in-patient treatment, provide that all private health insurers must pay benefit for a minimum of 100 days treatment per annum. The provision of a statutory guarantee of indemnity benefit for not less than 100 in-patient days represents insurance cover in excess of the three-month period within which 92 per cent of discharges in the four Health Services Executive areas occur.The Competition Authority stated in its report on the Private Health Insurance Market that if limited cover plans are found to be feasible and compliant with the relevant legislation and community rating then the Minimum Benefit Regulations should be amended to give the Health Insurance Authority responsibility for approving limited-cover plans proposed by health insurers. However, the Competition Authority went on to state that the key criterion for any such approval should be whether any such products could undermine community rating in the market.Having regard to proposals in the recent reports on the Private Health Insurance Market, I have asked the Health Insurance Authority to consult with stakeholders on defining the level of private health insurance cover which should be subject to community rating.

Subsequent data for year ending October to December 2006 and data for 2007 have not yet been released by the CSO."Reach Out", the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, was launched in 2005.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established by the Health Service Executive to oversee the implementation of the Strategy; to coordinate suicide prevention activities across the State; to consult widely in relation to the planning of future initiatives and to ensure best practice in suicide prevention.In 2006, an additional €1.2 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive specifically for suicide prevention initiatives.  A further €1.85 million has been allocated for 2007 bringing the total funding available in 2007 to support suicide prevention initiatives to approximately €8 million.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	422	The 2007 Pharmacy Act was passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year.  The Pharmacy Act will be commenced in 3 stages.  The first stage is to put in place the Council of the new Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  The second stage is registration, offences, powers of investigation etc.  The third stage regards complaints, inquires and discipline (fitness to practice provisions).A three stage process allows flexibility in implementation dates, given the complexity and number of new policies and procedures that the new PSI Council must have in place to accommodate each stage.The 2007 Pharmacy Act allows for the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in removing this derogation was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable.In relation to the removal of the derogation, new policies and procedures must be in place before the second stage of implementation of the Act, including the removal of the derogation, can proceed.  Under section 17 of the 2005 Interpretation Act, the Council can complete drawing up these policies and procedures prior to commencement of the relevant parts and sections of the Act and this will be done in stage one.The second stage of the implementation of the Act will deal with the new procedures for registration of pharmacists and pharmacy businesses under Part 4 of the Act, the conditions for conduct of a retail pharmacy business, including 3 years post-registration experience for supervising pharmacists, Part 7 of the Act on the investigation of alleged offences, breaches of codes or professional misconduct, regulations for supervision of the sale and supply of medicinal products and, in the interest of public safety, new conditions for registration of pharmacists in terms of forensic and linguistic competency.  Once these new policies and procedures and the new regulatory regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses, are put in place by the Council, it will be possible to revoke the 1962 Pharmacy Act and remove the derogation.

I have made enquiries of an tÁrd Chláraitheoir and the position is as set out below.Section 38 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 makes provision for the registration in Ireland of the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State, which occurs outside the State in the following circumstances: (a) If there was not at the time of the death a system of registration or a system that applied to that particular death in the country in which the death took place; or (b) If it is not possible to obtain from the country in which the death took place a copy of or extract from civil records of the death.Provision is also made in the Civil Registration Act 2004 for the registration of the death of a person aboard an Irish aircraft or Irish ship, or the death of an Irish citizen on board a foreign aircraft or foreign ship travelling to or from an Irish airport or port, as the case may be. The death of a member of the Garda Siochána or the Permanent Defence Force, or of the spouse or specified members of the family of such a member, while the member is serving outside the State as such a member, may be registered in Ireland.Where a family considers that these circumstances apply in respect of the death of a family member, an application may be made to an tÁrd Chláraitheoir, Government Offices, Convent Road, Roscommon, who will decide, on the basis of evidence available to him, whether such a death may be registered in the State.My Department has no function in relation to the repatriation of the remains of Irish citizens who die abroad, or in deciding whether a post mortem should be carried out.  I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs provides consular assistance to Irish citizens who travel abroad, including assistance in relation to deaths abroad of family members, and I would draw to the attention of the Deputy parliamentary question No 244 at column 265 of the Dáil Debates for 29 November 2005 in this regard.

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has recently appointed three Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.I have also made available an additional €26.7 million capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork and University College Hospital Galway will be handed over later this year.BreastCheck is currently available in fifteen counties in the Eastern, North Eastern, Midland and parts of the South Eastern regions and Western regions.  The counties covered are Cavan, Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Longford, Laois, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon,Wicklow, Westmeath and Wexford.  BreastCheck provides free screening to all women in the 50-64 age group in these counties.  The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in its National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the current programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focussed at present on the commencement of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Since the beginning of 2005 I have introduced a number of significant changes to the manner in which assessment for medical cards are undertaken.  The assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and more so in the case of dependent children.  Applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.  Also in 2005 I introduced the GP visit card as a graduated benefit, with the specific purpose that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their general practitioner.The range of GP services available to holders of a GP visit card is the same as is available to persons who hold a medical card.  The guidelines used by the HSE to assess applications for GP visit cards were initially 25% higher than those used in assessing applications for medical cards and from June, 2006, the differential increased to 50%.  The aforementioned changes in the assessment of medical cards also apply to GP visit cards.Between January 2005 (1,145,083) and June 2007 (1,243,466) an additional 98,383 people have medical cards.  As at 27th June 2007, 77,844 persons held a GP visit card.  Thus since January 2005, an additional 176,227 people have free access to GP services.My Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) monitor the number of medical cards and GP visit cards on an ongoing basis and the need for changes to the guidelines is kept under review, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.Prior to 2005 decisions to increase the medical card assessment guidelines were a matter for the former health board Chief Executive Officers.  Increases which were applied were generally in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The purpose of this was to ensure that people whose general circumstances had not changed did not lose entitlement.  It did not constitute a linkage with the social welfare system.  Under the current assessment arrangements, persons whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE  payments, even if these exceed the assessment guidelines, qualify for a medical card.I set out below a table for the Deputy showing medical card assessment guidelines increases over the past 10 years.YearSingle Person (under 66, living alone)Couple (under 66)Percentage Increase%1997£88.00£127.501998£89.00£129.0011999£92.00£133.0032000£93.50£135.0022001£100.00£144.507(€126.97)(€183.50)2002€132.00€190.5042003€138.00€200.004.52004€142.50€206.5032005 (Jan.)€153.50€222.007.52005 (Oct.)€184.00€266.5020

This will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP).  The total allocation to the new Service is €33 million; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5 million for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the ICSP by the end of the year.The National Cancer Screening Service is planning to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.

My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A & E and do not require admission.In March 2006, the HSE established a dedicated Task Force to facilitate the implementation of the HSE's Framework for addressing the problems arising in relation to the delivery of Emergency Department Services. The report of the Task Force was published on 1st June.The Task Force report noted that the majority of the hospitals which were identified as experiencing difficulties in relation to the delivery of Emergency Department services have for some time been meeting the initial performance targets set by the HSE.  There are a small number of hospitals which have experienced particular difficulties in seeking to achieve the targets.The Task Force report recommends that revised targets should be set to ensure that no patient waits longer than 12 hours for admission to an acute bed, once the decision to admit has been made.  The ultimate objective is a total wait time target of six hours from the time a patient presents at the Emergency Department to the time he or she is either admitted to an acute bed, or is treated and discharged home.  The Task Force acknowledged that further work is required in relation to the establishment of total wait time targets.  Key issues to be addressed by the HSE in this context are the standardisation of processes and models of care within Emergency Departments and the standardisation of waiting time measurement.The HSE has announced that it intends to introduced revised performance targets in October 2007.  The basis for the timing of the introduction of the revised targets is to take account of key infrastructural developments, including the commissioning of 700 additional public long-stay beds.  In addition, a number of Emergency Department developments, including admission lounges and Acute Medical Admission Units, are to become operational in 2007/2008.  These developments are designed to deliver improvements in terms of the clinical decision-making within Emergency Departments and to address dignity and privacy issues for patients awaiting admission to an acute bed.

Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA).  The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.Since the Group was established, a legal issue has arisen with regard to the Competition Act 2002 as it relates to the negotiation of professional fees. It would be incorrect to state that there is an excessive delay in completing this review. The issues involved are complex and my officials are working with the Attorney General's office to clarify the way forward.The existing contractual arrangements with private dental practitioners under the DTSS for provision of dental services to eligible patients remain in place although I am aware that some dentists have indicated that they wish to resign from this scheme.It should be noted that dentists withdrawing from the scheme are obliged to work a three months notice period. To date, 75 of those dentists who have indicated they will withdraw from the DTSS have actually done so; the total number of dentists in the DTSS is 1,198.It should also be noted that the Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the HSE (formerly the GMS) has not noticed any significant decrease in either the number of claims or the amounts paid to dentists under the DTSS. I am also informed that the HSE are continuing to monitor service levels within the DTSS.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.The Government has allocated additional funding to the HSE in recent years to assist in tackling intercountry adoption waiting times. The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.The Deputy will be aware that demands for assessment for intercountry adoption are continuously increasing. It should be noted that consequent on the increased number of children coming from abroad, there is also a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports for sending countries. These are also being undertaken by HSE social work staff.In a number of areas, the HSE have increased capacity through contract arrangements with non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise. Officials from my office are currently engaged in discussions with the HSE to explore these and other strategies to increase capacity across the country.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

These practices and procedures are subject to monitoring by my Department's Aviation Security Division and are also the subject of periodic reviews by international organisations, such as the EU Commission and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).It is not the practice to comment on specific security measures in place or that may be implemented at the State's airports; however, aviation security arrangements at Irish airports are kept under continuous review by my Department and the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by a senior official from my Department.  The Committee comprises representatives of Government Departments, State Airports, airlines, the Garda Siochana, the Defence Forces, Customs and Excise, An Post, Irish Aviation Authority, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and the Regional Airports.

Transport 21 provides funding for the delivery of an extensive prioritised rail based network in the ten-year period to 2015.  This network is based on the Dublin Transportation Office strategy "A Platform for Change".The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is tasked with the delivery of the Luas and Metro elements of Transport 21.  In the short to medium term the RPA is focused on delivering all Luas/Metro projects for which financial support is provided for in Transport 21.  Since the launch of Transport 21 in November 2005 a growing momentum has developed on the delivery of this very large investment programme including Metro North which will serve Nevinstown.The DTO strategy remains the longer-term strategic framework for transport in the Greater Dublin Area.  Funding is provided in Transport 21 for feasibility studies based on elements of the DTO strategy which are not included in the current ten-year programme and the RPA will conduct such studies during the timescale of Transport 21.  Among these is a Luas line on the Northside connecting Metro North and the DART/northern suburban rail network, from the Whitehall area to Kilbarrack area.

We also recognised the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future.While the European Union will continue to pursue its dialogue with Cuba's civil society and to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all areas of mutual interest.  In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.The recent Council Conclusions represent a balanced approach, which is in accordance with the principles of the Common Position.  The decision which we took in Council to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels will provide an opportunity for establishing an open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	460	There are no plans to ratify the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers which was finalised in 1977.  However, I would point out that the provisions of the Convention in relation to work permits and re-employment have been largely provided for through the provisions of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 and their implementation in practice.With regard to the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, as I and other Ministers have indicated in relation to similar questions in the past, Ireland has not signed nor has it any plans to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990.  This is also the position of other Member States of the European Union.This Convention is a complex and wide ranging one, which has been examined by a number of Government Departments.  I understand that before Ireland could consider ratifying it there would need to be significant changes across a wide range of existing legislation, including employment, social welfare, education, taxation and electoral law.  Moreover, many of the issues addressed by the Convention would have a European Union dimension.  This would also complicate any proposed ratification by Ireland of it, if our European partners were to continue to refrain from ratification, as they seem likely to do.  I would however say that I am fully committed to the prevention of exploitation of migrant workers and to ensuring that all workers benefit from the full range of our employment rights protections.In this respect I would point out that this range of protections has been added to by the Employment Permits Act 2006.  The Act provides a number of new important protections for migrant workers including:the granting of the employment permit to the employee, rather than the employer.the employment permit containing a statement of the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including that the employee may change employment through the application for another permit by a new employer.provision prohibiting employers from retaining the personal documents of employees, including passports, driving licenses or identity cards, as well as a provision preventing employers from deducting recruitment expenses, including employment permit fees, from the remuneration of employees.provision to ensure that migrant workers in respect of whom application is made for an employment permit are entitled to the national minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (as periodically up-dated).It might be noted that Ireland's extensive range of employment rights legislation is applicable equally to nationals and non-nationals alike, without differentiation as to country of origin.In addition, I would also stress that the provisions of the new Social Partnership agreement "Towards 2016" contain a new employment rights compliance package for all workers, which includes new legislation as well as the establishment of a new office for employment rights compliance — the National Employment Rights Authority has already been established on an interim basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Directive 98/6/EC on consumer protection in the indication of prices of products offered to consumers was transposed into Irish law by way of the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002).  The aim of the Directive is to ensure that consumers have unambiguous indications as to the price of products.  This is done by requiring traders to show the final selling price and the unit price of products.  The final selling price is defined as the final price inclusive of VAT and all other taxes.  The unit price is the price per kilo or litre (or square or cubic kilo or litre as appropriate).  The Directive is enforced by the National Consumer Agency.The Directive does not apply to services.  Though the requirement to indicate the selling and unit price of products is of general application, article 3(2) of the Directive allows member states to derogate from this obligation in the case, among other things, of products supplied in the course of a service.  According to a study undertaken for the European Commission, ten of the then fifteen member states, including Ireland, opted to avail of this derogation.As the Directive is a minimum harmonisation measure, member states had discretion to apply the domestic legislative provisions transposing the Directive to services.  According to the European Commission's Communication on the Implementation of the Directive, four of the fifteen member states at the time of the adoption of the Directive applied their transposition measures to services as have eight of the member states that have joined the European Union since 2004.  There is no information available on whether such extensions applied to all services or required the indication of both the unit and the selling price.As regards air fares, the Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Information (Advertisements for Airfares) Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument No. 468 of 2000) requires advertisements for airfares to state clearly (a) the total price payable for the airfare as one single amount and (b) where applicable, and separately, the monetary amount of any charge to be imposed in respect of the method of payment of the airfare.  I propose to amend the Order to revoke the requirement relating to the separate indication of charges for payment methods in the light of the proposed commencement in October of section 48 (regarding the prohibition of surcharges where one method of payment is chosen in preference to another) and section 49 (requiring that surcharges, where otherwise permissible, must be stated as part of the price of a good or service) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The Consumer Protection Act has also remedied the previous problem whereby criminal proceedings in relation to advertising orders, such as the Airfares Order, made under the Consumer Information Act 1978 could be taken only against the publisher of an advertisement and not against the person who had caused it to be published.I am aware that a proposed European Union Regulation on Common Rules for the Operation of Air Transport Services published in July 2006 includes a provision on price transparency in air fares.  The Consumer Information (Advertisements for Airfares) Order 2000 will be kept under review in the light of the progress of this provision of the proposed Regulation.

The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment therefore does not have any power to enforce Irish employment rights legislation on board these ships.The ship to which the Deputy refers is registered in Belize.  The responsibility for the safety, rates of pay and living and working conditions on board this ship rests, therefore, with the ship operator/ship owner and the flag state Belize.The International Labour Organisation, ILO, deals with living and working conditions on board ships internationally.  ILO conventions are enforced by Port State Control Officers of the Department of Transport and Marine.  In undertaking this role, the Department of Transport and Marine carries out port state control on foreign flagged ships operating in and out of Ireland.  I understand that the Port State Control Officers from that Department inspected this ship in New Ross on the 15th of May, 2007.  Several deficiencies were noted and as these posed significant risk to the safety of the crew, the ship was detained.  In accordance with international law it is now the responsibility of the flag state Belize to re-inspect the ship and to invite the Port State Control Officers of the Department of Transport and the Marine to re-inspect it when all deficiencies have been rectified.At a national level Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote decent global labour standards for seafarers.  A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva.  Ireland was represented at the 94th Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of government officials, nominees of the employers (IBEC) and of the workers (ICTU).  The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers.  Ireland fully supports the new Convention and voted in favour of the proposal.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135     together.The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 (No. 28 of 2000) provides protection to musical publishers and recording artists in respect of their productions and recordings.  The levels of protection provided are fully in line with EU and wider international law in the area of copyright and related rights and are widely regarded in Ireland and worldwide as providing an effective legislative framework for the protection of the intellectual property rights of musical authors, arrangers and performers as well as those of musical sound recording producers.In accordance with the normal principles of law applying between nations, Irish copyright law does not apply directly to the works of Irish citizens outside the jurisdiction.  However, where copyright in musical compositions and arrangements is concerned, Irish authors of such works are entitled, under the terms of our membership of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), to the protection of other countries copyright laws at a comparable high standard on a reciprocal basis (basis of national treatment) where those other countries are members of that Convention and of the World Trade Organisation.  In practice, this means that a high level of protection such as that available here in Ireland should equally be available to Irish composers and arrangers in most foreign jurisdictions.As regards record producers and performers, the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations of 1961- generally called the Rome Convention — and the World Intellectual Property Organisation WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996, set comparably high standards for similarly reciprocal protections for Irish citizens and companies in the majority of countries which now meet these standards.My Department and I receive regular correspondence relating to various issues including music copyright protection matters.  This would include expressions of concern related to counterfeiting and to the damage that results from copyright theft in fields like music, film and software in Ireland and internationally.  I regard counterfeiting and piracy of music and other works as being serious offences to be actively prosecuted when detected.  I am however broadly satisfied in this context that our legislation — and the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, in particular, provides wide-ranging powers to facilitate doing so in an effective way within Ireland, that our EU partners have similar laws in place in their countries and that, in our dealings with the wider world, we encourage and support tougher legislation and its enforcement in protecting intellectual property where and when that is needed.

The regime of control includes approval of new designs of weighing equipment, verification of instruments of an approved design upon installation and following repair or recalibration, and inspection over the life of the instruments.The maintenance of weighing equipment is carried out on a commercial basis by private companies and not by the LMS.  However, as stated above, the LMS are required under their legislation to verify the equipment after repair or recalibration; there is a charge for this service.  It is an offence to use an unverified measuring instrument for trade and it is the responsibility of the trader to ensure legal compliance.There is a presumption that measuring instruments used by a trader are for trade use unless they prove otherwise.  In this specific case, following further investigation and discussion with the LMS, a number of instruments verified were subsequently deemed as not subject to verification since they were used in product preparation rather than for trade.  The charge made in respect of the verification of these instruments was cancelled and the company was advised accordingly by letter of 29 June.I might add that every instrument used in trade must be inspected at intervals by a Legal Metrology Service Inspector to confirm that it continues to comply with legal requirements.  As a key enforcement function LMS Inspectors are granted powers of entry to conduct inspections at traders premises under Section 10 of the Metrology Act 1996.  However, I would stress that no charge is made for these inspections.

The group in question were provisionally allocated €9,000 for sports equipment under the 2006 Sports Capital Programme.  No drawdown of this grant has taken place to date and, in this context, the Department have recently written to the group asking for an update as to the progress of the project.The group were also reminded of the terms and conditions attaching to the provisional grant offer in particular, the ‘sunset clause' provision.  Under that provision, it is the responsibility of the grantee to ensure that the project commences and that the Department is informed of the status of the project within six months of the date of provisional grant allocation and that a substantial amount of work is completed within twelve months.  Those provisionally allocated grants under the 2006 programme were asked to achieve this by 30 September 2007.  Failure to do so may result in the grant being withdrawn by the Department after that date.I would advise the group concerned to respond to the request of the Department to provide a written update with regard to any delay in their project and, in this context, to make a case for an extension of the deadline if necessary.

Certainly, on the basis of our record-breaking performance in 2006, we are doing that. That record run has continued into 2007. For the first quarter of 2007, reports from the Central Statistics Office show that visitor numbers are up by over 6% on the corresponding period in 2006 while the associated revenue is up by almost12%.  Both of these figures are ahead of industry targets for the year.These positive developments should not deflect us from the immense challenges facing us in the marketplace. Maintaining and enhancing competitiveness is a major issue for Ireland as a whole and tourism in particular.In dealing with that issue, it is important to bear in mind that competitiveness is about  more than price movements and costs. It encompasses a wide range of factors. These include productivity, exchange rate movements, taxation policy, education training and skills, public and private infrastructure and innovation. In particular, productivity means the effective use of resources and innovation to increase the value-added content of products and services.The question of competitiveness in tourism, like any other productive sector, must be seen in that broader light. In terms of the more efficient use of resources and energy costs, I believe that the Tourism sector will, like many other sectors, have to increasingly adopt sustainable solutions.I believe that the Irish industry is, by and large, aware of the challenge. People on the ground in the tourism industry know how fiercely competitive the market is. They know that it is essential to provide value for money.  Ireland is not promoted or sold as a ‘cheap destination' but our selling proposition has to be competitive; by that I mean the combination of price, product quality and service quality. There will be less and less place for poor product and poor service.The Tourism Agencies continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness as a tourism destination and I will encourage them to assist the industry in responding to changing conditions through a variety of programmes in marketing, human resource development, quality enhancement, product development and productivity.Tourism is just one part, albeit a significant part, of the overall economy. There is a  competitiveness challenge for the economy as a whole and that challenge will be addressed by the Government's wider competitiveness agenda.

It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €400 cost of education allowance is payable.To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  People in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years. An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of a person wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of a person wishing to pursue a third level qualification. The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action plan.The current scheme is in place since January 1998 and has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  In Budget 2007 the scheme was extended so that people who are awarded Statutory Redundancy may access the BTEA scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  The  qualifying period for illness benefit recipients was also reduced from three to two years.  These further improvements to the BTEA scheme will come into effect from the beginning of the new academic year i.e. 1 September 2007.

The scheme is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a means test, has applied for any other benefit or allowances to which they maybe entitled, has registered for work with FÁS if they are of working age and satisfies a habitual residency test may qualify for basic SWA. Under the legislation a number of categories are specifically excluded from receiving assistance. These are people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes.The Dublin/Mid-Leinster Area of the HSE has advised that the person concerned applied for SWA in June 2007 at which time he was requested to provide further information about his place(s) of residence and his source(s) of income, for the period of residence in the State. This information was required in order to undertake an assessment of his entitlement to basic SWA. The person concerned was refused basic SWA as he failed to provide credible evidence that he satisfied the habitual residence condition and also because he was unable to provide evidence of his source(s) of income.The person concerned was informed of his right to appeal the decision to the designated appeals officer of the Executive. To date the Executive have not received an appeal.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	473	An integrated occupational pension scheme is one where the pension payable, or the design of the benefit promise made, takes into account the state pension (contributory), or other similar contributory benefits payable by the State. In the public sector, these schemes are usually referred to as "coordinated" schemes.Integrating occupational and social welfare pensions is a common practice and most defined benefit or final salary schemes are structured in this way. The practise is not generally subject to legislation but derives from the rules of individual pension schemes, though in the case of some public sector schemes it may be included in the statute under which the scheme operates.Defined benefit pension schemes are becoming increasingly expensive to provide.  By operating integration, an employer may be able to provide an employee on retirement with an earnings-related pension which might otherwise not be possible. Most members of a private defined benefit occupational pension scheme will qualify for the state pension to which the employee and the employer have contributed.The most common method of operating an integrated scheme is by what is known as "salary offset".  This means that the employer will regard the social welfare pension as providing pension rights in relation to part of the salary. This is not an unreasonable position given that both employers and employees contribute towards the social welfare pension.   Notional adjustments are made to salary that take account of this to arrive at the "pensionable salary," on which both employer and employee contributions to the occupational schemes are based.The manner in which integration operates can vary and depends on the rules of individual schemes. However, in a typical private sector scheme guaranteeing a total pension of two thirds of final income, salary is reduced by 1.5 times the social welfare payment to arrive at "pensionable salary".  When the pension is paid the combination of the occupational scheme and the social welfare payment will provide the overall target of two thirds of final salary.It should be pointed out that under the Pensions Act 1990, integration may only take place at the point when a pension is first paid. Legislation does not permit reductions to be made to occupational pensions in payment to take account of subsequent increases in the social welfare pension. The legislation also provides for a minimum level of benefit to be paid from an occupational scheme based on the total contributions made by the employee to that scheme.Occupational pension schemes are voluntary in nature. In designing schemes a balance has to be struck between the expectations of scheme members and the costs which employers are prepared to bear. The increasing cost of defined benefit schemes is already a deterrent to many employers and in these circumstances it would be difficult to countenance any measures which would add to these costs and the pressures which already exist in the defined benefit pensions area.The Pensions Board published ‘A Brief Guide to Integration' in booklet form which provides guidance on the integration of occupational pension schemes.  This is available free of charge from the Board and on its website www.pensionsboard.ie.

The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course. The scheme also provides an annual cost of education grant of €400.To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study. People in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.

When applying for a PPS number, customers are asked to complete an application form and to provide documentation to establish their identity and address.  They are usually informed of their PPS number by post within ten days.The PPS number is a main personal identifier and the key to access a broad range of government services.  My Department has, for some time, encountered attempted abuses of PPS registration process.  Forged or altered documentation has been presented in support of PPS number applications and, where these are detected, they are referred to the Gardaí for action.  In addition, the investigative staff of my Department are engaged in a range of control activities to combat identity fraud.In order to combat fraudulent activity of this nature, the number of outlets for the allocation of PPS numbers is being reduced to one centralised location per County.  The only exceptions are Tipperary and Cork, which will have two locations. As a result of this, customers in the Castletownbere area will be required to travel to Bantry and not to Cork city which would otherwise have been the case.

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase. The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups. This approach was continued in Budget 2007 with increases of up to €16 and €18 per week granted on personal rates. The policy is subject to review and I will consider the position in the context of the next budget.

This is achieved principally through the contribution based Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension, and the non-contributory Disability Allowance. A range of secondary benefits, such as the Free Travel Pass for those on Invalidity pension or Disability Allowance, are also provided while the Supplementary Welfare Allowance provides a means-tested safety net payment.Access to transport is an important prerequisite for people with disabilities in participating more fully in society in general and a number of Government Departments have responsibility for transport issues. For example, the Department of Transport is responsible for issues in relation to accessibility while, as indicated above, my Department is responsible for the Free Travel Pass. In addition, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance could be used, at the discretion of the Community Welfare Officer and on the basis of an ‘exceptional needs payment', to assist with the cost of taxis on a once-off basis in exceptional circumstances. However, in relation to specific non-public transport costs for people with disabilities, the Health Services Executive, under the Department of Health and Children, currently administers the Mobility Allowance, which is a means-tested payment aimed at providing financial assistance towards transport costs including taxi costs.

It is worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over seven years.  The second element is the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry, which arises following the renunciation of the sugar quota and the closure of the Mallow sugar factory. In Ireland's case, the restructuring aid is worth €145m approx.  The EU Regulations provide for payment of the first instalment of aid (40%) in June 2007 and the balance in February 2008.  Pending the conclusion of the legal proceedings over the Government decision of July 2006 on the allocation of the restructuring aid, arrangements were made to allow payment of the June instalment to commence last week.  This includes payment of €14.5m to the growers and machinery contractors, representing an undisputed 10% of the total amount.The third element of the compensation package is the diversification aid, worth almost €44m in Ireland's case.  A national restructuring programme was submitted to the EU Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulations, with a view to drawing down the diversification aid. The Regulations provide that payment of this aid would commence in September 2007.Following the reform of the Common Agriculture Policy in 2003, farmers now have the freedom to focus on new market opportunities including the area of purpose grown energy crops for use as a renewable source of energy in the heat, electricity and liquid biofuels markets. The market for energy crops is developing in response to the need to develop alternative renewable sources of energy. I am making €14 million available over the next three years to encourage farmers to grow energy crops. €6 million is being provided for a new national payment of €80 per hectare, which will be paid as a top-up to the €45 EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  A further €8 million is being made available for a new Bioenergy Scheme to encourage farmers to grow miscanthus and willow for use in the production of heat and electricity.  The Scheme provides farmers with establishment grants of up to 50% of the costs of establishment, subject to a maximum grant of €1,450 per hectare.  I am confident that these measures will encourage farmers to consider energy crops as an alternative land use option.

In discussions with the Commission, it requested that measures solely funded by the exchequer, such as this scheme, be removed from the programme.  My Department therefore prepared an application for state aid approval separately, as required under EU rules.  This is currently under consideration by the Commission.  My Department is in contact with the Commission with a view to advancing this consideration as rapidly as possible.In the case of the sheep sector, I set out in May a series of measures to assist the sector. These followed on from the work of the Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group.  They included a supplementary measure under REPS and support for on-farm investment by sheep farmers.  These measures form part of Ireland's Rural Development Programme, for which I hope to obtain approval shortly. Provision has also been made to assist the sector in the areas of production, breeding, quality assurance and animal health and welfare.  I am confident that this comprehensive package of measures will secure the full commitment of all those involved in the sector and the result will be a more efficient, competitive and profitable sheep industry at all levels.

During the course of the inspection the inspecting officer concluded that a parcel included on the application form submitted, was not being farmed by the applicant. As a result of this finding the claimed area of 30.88 ha. was reduced to 23.81 ha. The person named was informed of these findings on the 13th September 2006 and of their right to have the decision reviewed.Under EU Regulations if the total standard area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held penalties will be applied as per Article 50/51/53 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 796/2004 and as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 29.99.  As the difference between the area declared and the area found was more than 20%, under EU Regulations, no payment was due.A request for a review of the decision was received from the person named on the 17th January 2007. The reviewing officer, taking into account all documents submitted, upheld the original findings and the person named was informed of this decision on the 28th May 2007. They were also informed of their right to appeal the decision.  To date no appeal has been made.

The 2005 and 2006 phases of Decentralisation are now complete and planning and preparation are ongoing for the remainder of 2007 and subsequent phases.  To the end of June 2007 some 116 posts have moved to Portlaoise from Dublin across a range of Divisions such as Accommodation Division, Management Services Division, Meat Hygiene and Animal By-Products, Meat Policy, Milk Policy, Crop Policy, Personnel, Health and Safety, Corporate Affairs, Finance Division and Economics and Planning.  Some staff from Inspectorate Divisions have also moved.  In total there has been an increase of some 200 full time posts in Portlaoise since early 2004 which includes additional staff assigned to new posts in the newly introduced Single Payment Scheme (SPS).Overall there are currently over 400 of my Department's staff in Portlaoise.  Implementation Plans for Fermoy and Macroom are also in place and the recruitment process for Fermoy has begun.

As the brief for the project was subsequently increased, my Department's technical team carried out an assessment to determine how best to progress the project. It was decided that the project is a suitable candidate for an 8 Classroom Generic Repeat Design (GRD) school. The Board of Management subsequently accepted this proposal.Officials from my Department wrote to the Board of Management in May 2007 requesting a Stage 3 submission. When the stage 3 submission is received in my Department, my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School Authorities and their Design Team in order to evaluate the documentation. It is envisaged that unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to authorise the project to progress to the next stages of architectural planning.Progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.

In such cases, schools must complete and return Form LSRT 1 that issued with the circular. A separate form is required for each post.I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence, together with the relevant forms, from the school in question.  This documentation is currently being examined and contact will be made with the school authorities shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  However, I can tell the Deputy that school building projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need using published criteria.All applications for capital funding are assessed in accordance with these criteria which were drawn up following consultation with the education partners. Following this assessment, each application is assigned a band rating. Progress on individual projects is consistent with that band rating.This Government is delivering on its commitment to provide modern facilities in schools and has progressively increased funding in recent years.  The budget for 2007 is the first year of the rollout of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school infrastructure over the next 7 years. This year alone over €540 million will be spent on school buildings.  This will deliver over 1,500 large-scale and smaller scale projects.  This, by any standards, is an enormous capital programme.The availability of multi-annual funding will enable the Department to continue to take a proactive, structured approach to the provision of modern school accommodation.

My Department provides a special per capita grant to schools in the free education scheme offering TYP. This is in respect of additional teaching hours required to allow for co-ordination and planning and for any other expenses related exclusively to the TYP.I understand that schools are sensitive to the costs associated with TYP and seek to take account of the capacity of students and their families to meet the costs involved.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I recently announced that the TYP grant is to be increased from €63.49 to €100 per pupil with effect from the 1st September 2007.

Armagh.  Both Departments have jointly funded the purchase of the former St. Joseph's Adolescent Centre, Middletown and plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a Centre of Excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland.  The Centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders.  It will be multi-disciplinary and operate in support of local services across Ireland North and South.Four key services will be provided by the Centre:a learning support service (on a residential basis),an educational assessment service,a training and advisory service, andan autism research and information service.Both Departments have set up an Operating Company (Middletown Centre for Autism Limited MCAL) which is governed by a Memorandum and Articles of Association.  A Board of Directors has been appointed to manage the Centre.Mr Gary Cooper has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the overall day-to-day management of the Centre. The CEO of the Centre is the Accounting Officer responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the centre. To date my Department has spent in the region of €2,754,352 on the project which is inclusive of the purchase price.The departmental Accounting Officer in the Department of Education Northern Ireland and the Secretary General of my Department are accountable to their respective Assembly/ Oireachtas for the issue of any grant-in-aid/grant to the Centre.  A Director of the Company or a member of its staff will if so requested, appear before, or otherwise co-operate with a Northern Ireland Assembly Committee or sub-Committee of either House or both Houses of the Oireachtas, in accordance with normal practice and relevant legislation within each jurisdiction.It is expected that the Centre will commence limited services in 2007 with the first intake of children not expected until the building work is completed in 2008.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by €18 per pupil and now amounts to €316 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €189 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000. This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.Budget allocations for schools in the VEC and C&C sectors are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. My Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	509	My Department is aware that there is an application on hand for inclusion in the ABA pilot scheme from an Acorn ABA group. However, my Department is not aware of this centre being established or its location other than the group envisages that it will be located in the Malahide area.My Department considers that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.Children with autism in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA, TEACCH and PECS. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.By enabling children in special autism-specific classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, TEACCH and PECS, my Department is reflecting advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and my Department's inspectorate. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish task force on autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method. The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that it should be the only method used. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.In terms of autism provision across the country, my Department will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for particular methodologies as appropriate, in special classes. In excess of 200 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time. There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have his or her individual SNA if he or she needs one. The National Council for Special Education will continue to expand the number of such classes as necessary to meet demand.

They do not provide a service to gifted children.In general, schools at both primary and second level may use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.In addition, my Department provides annual funding to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes, which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age. This year's grant is €95,000.My Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to further improve services for gifted children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	511	While the Department encourages the use of School Buildings outside of school hours by local community and other groups, by nature, these groups are generally private and any arrangements between such groups and a school are a matter between the Trustees and the Board of Management. Such after school activities do not normally attract grants from the Department but the specifics in the case raised by the Deputy will be checked and the details will be sent to the Deputy when available.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Deputy will be aware that my Department implemented a new scheme for allocating learning support / resource teachers (LS/RTs) to schools to cater for the needs of children with high-incidence special educational needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties in all primary schools in September 2005. The general allocation model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers and is designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs including dyslexia. The scheme reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments. It also facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols.It is a matter for the individual school to use its professional judgement to identify pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines and advice on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.Where a pupil's condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the 4 special schools, or 22 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools, dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation grant.My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser directly for this support.My Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom.The position regarding assessments is that schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) administered by NEPS. Schools that do not currently have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them may avail of the SCPA scheme. This Scheme allows the school to commission assessments from members of a panel of psychologists in private practice approved by NEPS. The fees for these assessments are paid directly by NEPS to the psychologist. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on the Department's Website, www.education.gov.ie.The Deputy may be aware that 31 additional psychologists are to be recruited to the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in 2007. This will increase the total number of psychologists in NEPS by 25%, to 158. The extra 31 psychologists that will be recruited in 2007 will mean that more schools will have a direct service from NEPS.My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.The question of tax relief is a matter for my colleague, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen T.D.

It is a matter for the trustees and board of management to determine how spare facilities should be utilised. While my Department is supportive of such measures the priority for the use of these facilities has to be given to educational services funded by my Department. My Department has a particular role in pre-school provision in the areas of educational disadvantage and special needs. It also works closely with the Office of the Minister for Children in the promotion of quality early education generally. My Department does not have plans to take over community play groups.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	514	My Department provides funding to schools with special classes for pupils with a Severe or Profound General Learning Disabilities and classes for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders to enable them to provide a July Educational Programme. Where schools are unable to put such a programme in place, then parents may apply to the Department for funding to put a home tuition programme in place for July.As this tuition takes place in the home, outside of a school structure, the most basic requirement is to ensure that the tuition provider is suitably qualified to provide the optimum intervention. My Department's qualification preference is for a fully qualified teacher. Where parents cannot recruit a fully qualified teacher, then certain alternative qualifications are acceptable including particular montessori qualifications and details in this regard are published on my Department's web site. Conscious that some parents occasionally encounter difficulties in securing the services of a qualified tuition provider, my Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to provide a central database of suitably trained personnel seeking employment as home tutors.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established to make fair and reasonable payments to persons who, as children, suffered abuse while resident in Industrial Schools, Reformatory Schools and other institutions subject to state regulation or inspection.Persons who were placed in such institutions generally remained there until they reached their 16th Birthday, at which time they were released either back to their family units or to employment.  In certain exceptional circumstances, my Department did sanction an extension of the period of residency past the age of 16, usually for one year or less and primarily to allow residents to complete educational programmes.  In such cases, the children involved would have remained under the care of the management of the school and the State would have continued to provide for their upkeep in the institution.  However, such persons would still be under the age of 18 upon final release.Once officially released, the State would have borne no responsibility for persons who remained in certain institutions.  From the information available to my Department, it appears that a number of residents would have taken up employment with/through the management of the institutions.  This is a private arrangement between the former resident and their employer and the state could not be held liable for any abuse which may have occurred in such circumstances or during that period.The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 defines a "child" as a person who has not attained the age of 18 years.  Consequently, persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years are not eligible to be considered for redress under the terms of the aforementioned Act.  It should be noted that a person's ineligibility to apply for redress by means of the Redress Board does not affect their statutory right to explore any other legal avenue which may be open to them.

Schools with vacant accommodation include:Mount Sion CBSWaterpark CollegePresentation Secondary schoolOur Lady of Mercy Secondary SchoolSt. Paul's Community College.Given that there is spare accommodation in two all boys schools and in one co-educational facility, I am satisfied that there is no shortage of accommodation for boys in the City.A technical inspection of the school referred to by the Deputy will be arranged consistent with both the final outcome of the review in terms of the long term accommodation needs of the area as a whole and the band rating which attaches to the project under the published prioritisation for large scale building projects.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The closing date for receipt of applications under the Dormant Accounts / RAPID Leverage Fund Small Scale Capital Grants Scheme for schools was 1st March. The scheme covers the improvement of existing facilities ('non new-builds') and the development of new facilities ('new-builds') in four areas: (i) Outdoor Play Facilities; (ii) Libraries; (iii) Parent Rooms; and (iv) Dining Areas. Schools were asked to list their proposals under the four areas in terms of priorities from 1 to 4.The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed in terms of numbers of applications and the amount of funding sought by applicants. This has meant that the original time-frame for the assessment of applications has been somewhat delayed and there is insufficient funding to cover these applications. As a result, a phased approach to applications is being implemented which divides the assessment of proposals into ‘new-builds' and ‘non new-builds'; this approach was notified on 14th June to the schools which applied under the scheme.Phase 1 of this process involved an assessment of all ‘new-build' and ‘non new-build' applications for Outdoor Play Facilities which were identified by the schools as either Priority 1, 2 or 3 — lower priorities are not being assessed because there is insufficient funding available. Subject to Government approval being received shortly on the basis of these assessments, the Department should be in a position to advise schools about the success of their applications for Outdoor Play Facilities within the next two weeks.All proposals in respect of Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas involving new-builds' will be considered for funding under the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme.

Section 9(2) of that Act provides that where a fixed term employee is employed by his or her employer on two or more continuous contracts and the aggregate duration of such contracts exceeds 4 years the contract is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless there are objective grounds to justify a renewal beyond the 4 years.A contract of indefinite duration is normally regarded as a contract where a "A person who has an expectation that, subject to the normal date of retirement in the employment, she or he will be retained in the employment and will not be dismissed without there being any good reason such as misconduct or unfitness for their position, or other compelling or unavoidable circumstances.  Any dismissal shall be achieved by the application of the agreed termination arrangement for the particular sector or the application of the relevant statute, as the case may be."This definition is subject to review in light of decisions given by the Labour Court or other judicial processes. The issue of the differences between a contract of indefinite duration and a permanent contract is a legal question which is currently being considered by the courts.

The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside of the island of Ireland.Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of the island of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector. At present, there are no plans to expand the provisions in the grant schemes in relation to study abroad.However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000/01 onwards, applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the candidate's Local Tax Offices.

One hundred posts (100) will relocate to Athlone and 300 posts will relocate to Mullingar.  The Athlone element of the decentralisation includes a re-organisation which will reunite a section in Athlone, which has been divided between Dublin and Tullamore since decentralisation to Tullamore in 1995.  Those officers in Tullamore whose posts will move to Athlone will be re-assigned to posts to move from Dublin to Tullamore. Almost all of the 400 posts to move from Dublin will relocate when office accommodation is ready for occupation in Athlone and Mullingar respectively.The provision of accommodation under the programme of decentralisation falls within the remit of the Office of Public Works (OPW). The OPW has indicated to the Decentralisation Implementation Group that it anticipates that new office accommodation will be ready in Athlone next year and that it should be ready in Mullingar sometime in 2009.To date, my Department has been able to facilitate 24 CAF (Central Applications Facility) applicants with direct transfers to posts in its offices in Athlone and Tullamore or one of its regional offices outside of Dublin, as posts became available due to other transfers under the CAF.In addition, it will be possible to move up to 8 posts from my Department's office in Tullamore to the office in Athlone this year as a small amount of accommodation has become available in the existing offices in Athlone. This will allow for the movement of a corresponding number of posts from Dublin to Tullamore. This will reduce the number of posts in Dublin and will result in no net gain or loss associated with decentralisation.

The Convention is concerned with the legal situation of migrant workers, in particular employment, residence and work permits, family reunifications, working conditions and the transfer of savings, social security and medical assistance.  Ireland has not signed the Convention and there are no current plans to do so.  The Council of Europe website shows only 6 current members of the EU as having ratified the Convention and none of these ratifications have taken place in the past 10 years.  It is some years since this matter was last examined by the relevant Government Departments but there is no indication at this point of any pressing need for Ireland to change its previous position or that national measures in this area are inadequate.In relation to the International Convention, I would refer the Deputy to the reply to  Parliamentary Question No. 45 of  4 April, 2007.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Since the Deputy has not provided details of a particular case, I can only set out the position generally.Section 15 (d) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 provides that an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation must have a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.Section 16 (a) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001 qualified that residency requirement so that when calculating residence in respect of an applicant  who is required to have permission to reside in the State, no period will be reckoned where the applicant does not have such permission.  In addition, any time spent seeking to be recognised as a refugee or for the purpose of study must also be discounted.Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.Applicants other than those listed above should satisfy the statutory residency requirement at the time of lodging an application for naturalisation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I am advised by the Citizenship Section of my Department that the number of applications for naturalisation which have yet to be processed to a conclusion is approximately 15,000.  Such applications are generally dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed to be fairest to all applicants.  The processing time is, on average, thirty months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  The table below shows the total number of applications received in the years 2000 to date.  These figures illustrate a significant upward trend and with over 3,000 applications received to date in 2007, this upward trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.YearApplications for naturalisation received20001,00420011,43120023,57420033,58020044,07420054,52320067,0302007
(as at 3 July, 2007)3,400The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda Síochána to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, having regard to the resources available, which are kept under constant review, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.  However, I share the Deputy's concerns regarding the efficiency of the existing system and accordingly, I have instructed my officials to undertake a review of the various processes in order that these might be streamlined further where possible.

Section 15 of that Act requires that the applicant must have had a period of one years continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.The Deputy suggests that delays in the issue of work permits may result in an applicant being unable to fulfil the residency requirements for naturalisation.  However, the above Act provides that in determining residency for the purposes of naturalisation no period shall be reckoned where the applicant did not have the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State.  This particular statutory provision does not provide for the reasons for not having such permission to be taken into account.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	548	In March 2006, the family of the person in question was offered an ex gratia payment for their representation as a unit at the Inquest.  That exceptional ex gratia offer was expressed to be subject to the then maximum Government approved rates for representation at Tribunals of Inquiry — i.e. €800 per day for a solicitor, €744 per day for a junior counsel or €1116 per day for a senior counsel.In addition, agreement was reached under the auspices of the Coroner between the Garda Síochána, the Forensic Science Laboratory and legal representatives for the deceased's family to allow the latter's independent experts to attend the laboratory and carry out an examination of certain exhibits.  It is important to note that my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not represented at the Inquest and, quite properly, had no role to play in any agreement reached.  The Minister was however asked by the family of the deceased to provide further funding to pay for those independent experts.Having considered the matter carefully and consulted with the Coroner he was unable to accede to this request.I should explain that a Coroner's Inquest is not an adversarial process like a criminal trial — it is inquisitorial rather than adversarial in nature.  The person who decides who gives evidence is the Coroner.  The Coroner has indicated the evidence of the third party expert will not be admissible at the Inquest.Given the Coroner's stated view on the admissibility of the evidence in question and the fact that there is already independent evidence available to the him  via the objective expert evidence of the Forensic Science Laboratory, I consider that it would be imprudent to accede to this request in circumstances where generous financial assistance has already been offered to the family for legal representation and where the only purpose of the independent experts would be to act  as private advisors to Counsel as distinct from giving evidence.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I propose to take Questions Nos. 229, 234, 235, 237, 238 and 240 together.As the Deputy is aware, there is a statutory framework governing the asylum determination process in Ireland set out in the Refugee Act, 1996.  The 1996 Act established two independent statutory offices to consider applications and appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.  These offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).The processing of asylum applications is undertaken within the framework of the Refugee Act 1996 and in each case due regard is had to the definition of a "refugee" in section 2 of that Act, which states that a "refugee" is—"...a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it" .Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, where necessary, an appeal with the statutorily independent Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Each application is assessed on the basis of the circumstances of the individual case and having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant's own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant's country or place of origin).  In cases such as those described by the Deputy, if a woman establishes a credible and objectively verifiable claim that she is fleeing persecution for reasons stated, then it is possible for such claims to fall within the ambit of the refugee definition.  However, each claim is the subject of an individual examination on its merits.In reply to the Deputy's question about statistics relating to the number of applicants who may cite gender related persecution in respect of their asylum application, I am advised that the current management information systems in operation in ORAC and RAT do not provide for the compilation of statistics in relation to the different types of persecution.  However, work is now ongoing on the development of a comprehensive management and statistical information system for both organisations as part of the development of a new computer system for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  When this system is in place in mid-2008, it should be possible to generate the type of information requested by the Deputy.As I indicated, each application for asylum is investigated on its own merits.  In the case of a married couple, separate interviews are conducted and separate reports are competed in relation to the results of each investigation.  Accordingly, an applicant is not automatically granted the same status as their spouse.  Where one is granted status, the other may apply for permission to remain in the State under the ‘family reunification' provisions of the Refugee Act 1996.  Both refugee status and temporary permission to remain in the State are subject to possible re-examination by the Minister, where appropriate and necessary.As regards the Deputy's question on documents, I am informed that the report of the investigation and any accompanying documentation is sent to each adult applicant separately.  Where a child or children form part of a parent's application, any documentation on the child is sent to the parent that has included the child/children in their application.  Where a separate application is made on behalf of a child, the child's application will be investigated separately, a separate file will be opened, and an interview will take place where either or both parents may attend.  The report and recommendation on the results of the investigation are generally sent addressed to the minor applicant "care of" the parent that attended their interview.In relation to the Deputy's question on the way in which information is provided to asylum applicants, I am informed that when a person applies for asylum at ORAC, a comprehensive information leaflet is provided, which is available in over two dozen languages and explains how the asylum process in Ireland operates.  Applicants are also given a Customer Service Advice Leaflet and the Refugee Legal Service Information, RLS, Leaflet.  Asylum applicants are informed of their right to consult a solicitor and/or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  ORAC has a Customer Service Centre, CSC, which is a central contact point for telephone, written and email enquiries to the Office, and deals with requests for information from applicants, legal representatives, agencies and members of the public.  ORAC also has in place a Customer Liaison Panel of Non-Governmental Organisations.  The panel, which meets twice a year, provides a communication tool for ORAC and NGOs and provides an opportunity to highlight issues which might be of concern to asylum applicants.In addition to the above sources of information, since 2003, ORAC has its own website , www.orac.ie, which makes information about the Office and its activities more easily available to interested parties.Relevant information on the appeals process is also furnished to applicants by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The Refugee Legal Service (RLS) is a dedicated legal service provided by the Legal Aid Board for persons applying for asylum in Ireland.  The RLS provides a service to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process and applicants may register with the RLS at any stage of the process — initial application, appeal stage and, post asylum, in relation to matters such as applications for subsidiary protection and humanitarian leave to remain.I am informed that the RLS uses a variety of methods to inform potential clients of the availability of its service.  These include leaflets describing its services, a general information leaflet about the asylum process, posters, outreach activities, presentations and seminars.  Leaflets are available in a number of different languages and are distributed to various Government and Non-Governmental Organisations nationwide, while posters are displayed in a number of strategic locations.As part of its information provision service, the RLS provides an outreach service from its locations in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  There are a number of elements to the outreach service, including regular visits by RLS staff to the reception centres in the Dublin area and also to the dispersed accommodation centres throughout the country.  Each reception centre in Dublin is visited by RLS staff once per week.  Accommodation centres in dispersed locations are visited less frequently — perhaps once a month, or as necessary based on indications received from the accommodation centres.

In that context, various Government Departments including the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Environment and Local Government and Health and Children provide funding for local community groups.  In addition funding is also provided through the various philanthropic bodies, statutory and non-statutory organisations e.g. the Health Service Executive (HSE), Pobal, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism , NCCRI, and the Combat Poverty Agency among others.  Though the funds available are not specifically targeted at supporting asylum seekers, they do constitute part of the beneficiary groups.My Department has established a small grants funding scheme administered by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) which is part of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  The RIA actively promotes the establishment and development of community based groups specifically designed to support asylum seekers living in the portfolio of accommodation provided by the Agency.  These support groups aim to encourage and facilitate the active participation of asylum seekers in local community life and the activities developed by this network promote a self help approach.In 2006, 59 intercultural projects/initiatives around the country, designed to support asylum seekers, were funded under the Small Grants Scheme at an approximate cost of €140,000.The European Refugee Fund was established in 2000 by the European Union to provide financial support to organisations in respect of services for refugees and asylum seekers. Ireland currently receives €1.2m approx. per annum from the Fund which is administered in Ireland by the Reception and Integration Agency.  Twenty groups in Ireland have received support under the current phase of the Fund.  The next phase of the Fund will operate from 1 January, 2008 and projects will be selected following a public call for proposals.

In small centres menus are cycled on a 7-day or 14-day basis.  The menus offered reflect the reasonable needs of the different ethnic groups and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated in centres.All contractors are required to serve, breakfast, lunch and dinner each day.  Breakfast must include eggs, a choice of a minimum of 6 cereals, a choice of 3 or 4 juices, a selection of fruit and cheese,  milk, tea, coffee, toast, brown and white bread, rolls and a selection of spreads, jams and preserves.  Lunch must consist of a choice of 3 light main courses (to vary daily) together with salads, rice, potatoes, juices, tea and coffee.  In the case of dinner, it must include a choice of 2 starters (1 hot and 1 cold) or desert or yoghurt and a choice of 3 main courses (to vary daily) to include a meat dish, a fish dish and a vegetarian dish.  Dishes on offer for dinner include Chicken, Lamb, Lasagne, Nigerian Style Egg Fried Rice with Chicken, Chicken Egusi, Romanian Chicken stew, Ogbuno Soup and Pounded Yam, Lamb Kleftico, Lemon Pepper Haddock, Pork Paprika and Roast Joints.  Dinner also includes rice, potatoes, chips and tea, coffee, milk, soft drinks and water.  Tea, coffee, biscuits, crackers, cheeses and fruit are made available, at the discretion of contractors, outside of normal meal times.Where there are children in centres, a selection of baby foods and yoghurts must be on display and available.  In the case of infants, infant formula, infant food and fresh water for the preparation of infant formula must be available.  As regards school-going children, a packed lunch to include at least a sandwich, fruit and a beverage are provided.All contractors are required to consult regularly with residents to ascertain what foods they prefer and how such foods should be cooked.  These meetings are particularly important where many ethnic groups may be accommodated in the same centre.  Every effort is made to ensure that the ethnic and dietary needs of residents are met.  However, maintaining this on a daily basis for all the different ethnic groups can sometimes prove difficult.  Menus are kept under review and are revised from time to time with a view to meeting the ethnic dietary needs of residents to the greatest extent possible.Regular inspections of centres by RIA staff and by an Independent Inspectorate are carried out and appropriate measures are taken where the requirements of residents are not being met.  In addition, RIA staff, including senior management, regularly eat in centres to ensure that the fare on offer is of the standard required.In relation to the running of centres generally, residents are provided with a copy of the House Rules and Procedures, which incorporate a complaints procedure, on arrival and speak to centre management on a one to one basis.  Management organise regular meetings with residents, where issues can be addressed.  Moreover, RIA staff regularly hold ‘clinics' in centres where residents can raise issues in relation, inter alia, the running of the centre, the provision of services at the centre and any additional supports which they would like to have provided at the centre.Residents can also make representations to the Reception and Integration Agency through third parties, including local support groups, other NGOs, State service providers, health professionals, political representatives and so on.

The Deputy will wish to note that the statistics provided are approximate figures only.  In relation to the additional information requested by the Deputy regarding children and male relatives associated with these applications, I am advised that this information is not readily available to my Department.During the period 1 January 1992 to 30 June 2007, approximately 31,278 applications for refugee status were received in the State from female applicants.  The Deputy may wish to note that some 23,328 of these female applicants were 18 years or over at the time of application.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible, inter alia, for the accommodation of asylum seekers through the policy of direct provision.The direct provision system seeks to ensure that the accommodation and ancillary services provided by the State meet the requirements of asylum seekers during the period in which their requests for asylum are being processed.  Through direct provision, asylum seekers benefit from free full board accommodation without utility or other costs.In addition to meeting these basic living costs, a direct provision allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child was introduced some years ago and is paid by Community Welfare Officers (operating under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs) who also have the discretion to make once-off exceptional needs payments in special situations and other payments (e.g. back to school clothing).  The direct provision allowance seeks to reflect the value of the above-mentioned services to the asylum seeker.The Department of Social and Family Affairs has stated that the direct provision allowance is made payable to the person who registers for the allowance.  In the case of a family, the payment would be made to whichever spouse makes the application for the allowance in the first instance.  This is the same for other social welfare schemes operated by or on behalf of that Department.Asylum seekers in direct provision also qualify for medical cards and can access the public health service in the same way as an Irish citizen.Children are entitled to free education at Primary and Post-Primary level.

There is no basis for believing that domestic violence in accommodation centres is any more frequent than in the rest of the community.

The applicant was informed of the above decision by registered post on 14 June 2007.  The Regulation requires that in order to avail of residency rights under the Regulation, applicants must submit evidence showing lawful residence in another EU Member State prior to arrival in Ireland.

The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more efficient and cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  Under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority was established as and from 4 November 2006.  The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.  In order to be of assistance the Deputy's query has been forwarded to the Authority for direct reply via the above mentioned service.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I am delighted to say that my Department's decentralisation programme is fully on target.  It is scheduled to run until 2009 and will involve the relocation of 885 posts to seven locations.  By the end of this month, over 240 staff will have taken up duty in my Department's decentralised locations.  The Private Security Authority (25 posts) is up and running in Tipperary, and the Garda Central Vetting Unit (35 posts) is already operational in Thurles.  The Property Registration Authority (Land Registry) now has 45 staff in Roscommon, with more to follow later this year.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (23 posts) moved to Portarlington in December 2006.  An advance party of five staff from the Equality Authority took up duty in Roscrea in May 2007, with an a further 15 to take up duty in Roscrea before the end of this year.  The Irish Prison Service is in the process of moving to its new headquarters in Longford and one hundred and eleven staff will have taken up duty there by the end of this month.Other moves due to take place before the end of this year include the decentralisation of another 37 posts from the Garda Civilian HR Unit to Navan and 43 posts from the Fixed Charge Penalty Office to Thurles.  Consideration is also being given to an advance move of up to 50 posts from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) to Tipperary town, subject to the availability of suitable accommodation.  By the end of this year, my Department will have moved over 400 posts and will have a presence in all seven decentralised locations.The net impact on Dublin based posts is broadly neutral.  However, in a small  number of cases, decentralisation has coincided with changes in policy that have given rise to the creation of additional posts, e.g. the expansion of the Garda Central Vetting Unit to cater for an increased workload, and the establishment of new bodies such as the Private Security Authority and the National Property Services Regulatory Authority.

This represents an increase of 88 (or 15.2%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.  It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of these Garda stations will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

Facilities to read and print off video images are available to all Divisional Headquarters within Dublin.I am committed to the further expansion of the Garda CCTV programme around the country, including in Dublin, and this process is ongoing.  An Garda Síochána's plans to provide Garda CCTV systems in Finglas, Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Tallaght are at an advanced stage.  I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that under the Community-based CCTV Scheme run by my Department a number of applications from Dublin have been successful and have been awarded capital development funding to install local CCTV systems.  These include areas in Tallaght and Clondalkin and the Liberties in Dublin.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	571	The person concerned arrived in the State on 21 June, 2002 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 14 April, 2003, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement.  Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from the Refugee Legal Service for temporary leave to remain in the State.  On 28 June 2004, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him.  Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 20 January 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.  The person concerned failed to present himself as required and was classified as evading his deportation.  He should therefore present himself to the GNIB without further delay.  The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State.The Deputy might wish to note that, in addition to the eleven factors contained in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), I must, as stated earlier, also have regard for Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement before making a deportation order.  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to Angola and other third countries.  In this case, I am entirely satisfied that there are no refoulement related reasons to prevent the deportation of the person concerned.The person concerned is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum and subsequently for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  She failed to appeal the decision within the specified timeframe therefore the Refugee Appeals Tribunal did not consider her application.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 8 November 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

When such minor children reach sixteen years of age they are obliged to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau or their local Immigration Officer, in their own right.In order to register, they must first submit an application, in writing, to remain in the State based on being a family dependant of the parent of an Irish born child who has been granted residency under the IBC/05 scheme.  The application should be submitted to Irish Born Child Unit, P.O. Box 10003, Dublin 2 and should be accompanied by the applicant's original passport, original long form birth certificate (translated if not in English), two signed passport size photographs and evidence of dependency.  To date, no application in respect of the person in question has been received by my Department.

In this case, the child in question was born in the State on 14th January, 2004.  The applicant mother left the State with her child in October 2004 and claimed asylum in the U.K. on 9th November, notwithstanding the fact that she had already claimed asylum in this State.  She was returned to the State by the U.K. authorities under the terms of the Dublin Convention on 16th March, 2005.  Limited evidence was submitted by the applicant father as to his place of residence since the child's birth.  However, he cannot have been residing with the child while the child was with his mother in the U.K.  The applicants did not meet the criteria for the granting of permission to remain in the State under the revised processing arrangements insofar as continuous residency is concerned and the applications were refused on this basis.My Department is currently appealing a number of matters related to the IBC/05 Scheme to the Supreme Court.  The matters above will be considered further in the light of the findings of the Court.

However, my Department introduced a 5 year Regional Road Signposting Programme in 2003 with the aim of upgrading directional signposts on all significant junctions on all regional roads in county council areas.  In 2007, a sum of €7 million has been provided for this programme.Local authorities may also use discretionary improvement and block grants towards the cost of providing signposting on non-national roads.  In 2007, the discretionary improvement grant allocation to County Councils is €24,998,000 and the block grant allocation to City, Borough and Town Councils is €16 million.

The immediate priority is to augment the city's supply from the Tuam Regional Water Supply Scheme to allow the old Terryland Plant, the source of the cryptosporidium outbreak, to be decommissioned as soon as possible.My Department has also made additional financial and staffing resources available to the Galway local authorities to address short-term emergency measures and to implement the permanent, long-term infrastructural solutions.  Galway City has received €825,000 and Galway County Council €356,000 from a funding package of €15 million allocated to local authorities earlier this year to assist with the operational costs of water and sewerage schemes.  The amounts allocated to Galway reflect the additional costs to the authorities arising as a result of the outbreak.Both Councils received sanction in May 2007 for additional engineering and administrative posts to respond to the present situation and to accelerate the provision of new drinking water infrastructure approved under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07.  The Galway City Water Supply and the Tuam Town Water Distribution schemes are being funded under the Programme at a combined estimated cost of over €48 million and are being advanced with every possible urgency.   My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07 provides for total expenditure of over €451 million on new water and sewerage schemes for Galway City and County.Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003, primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter lies with local authorities.  Every opportunity will continue to be taken by my Department to urge local authorities to enforce the litter laws as rigorously as possible and to pursue litter awareness-raising and education initiatives.My Department has overall policy responsibility for built heritage, while OPW is responsible for the day-to-day management of certain national historic properties in State ownership/ guardianship.As part of the substantial annual financial assistance (some €36.724 million in 2007) made available by my Department for the protection of the built heritage, almost €20 million has been allocated in 2007 under the Built Heritage Capital Programme for the carrying out of conservation  works at (a) heritage properties in State ownership, (b) certain other properties not in State care, (c) civic structures which are in public ownership or open to the public generally and (d) properties which are on the Register of Protected Structures (RPS) administered by the local authorities. This investment will complement the funding being provided under the Tourism Product Development Strategy 2007-2013 which is being promoted by Fáilte Ireland under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.My Department also funds the Heritage Council to cover its operational costs as well as providing funding for its capital grants schemes and for Heritage Week which is administered by the Council.

Such an approach would reduce the marginal cost to be met by the Council in respect of this upgrading and the Council was also asked to undertake a corresponding review of the Water Services Pricing Policy Report.  A response is awaited from the Council.

One aspect of the judgment in that case was that Ireland was in breach of Article 7(2) of the original Dangerous Substances Directive by failing to make certain local authority discharges subject to authorisation.Draft regulations providing for a new authorisation regime for all discharges from local authority waste water treatment plants are nearing completion in my Department, in consultation with the European Commission and other relevant interests. I expect to make these regulations, which will also give further effect to the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), in the near future.In relation to the European Court of Justice judgment in Case C-316/00 concerning Ireland's failure to comply with certain micro-biological parameters of Council Directive 80/778/EEC relating to water intended for human consumption, a detailed response, addressing the various points raised in the Article 228 reasoned opinion, issued to the Commission on 23 May 2007.

It relates to the labelling of organic food, which comes under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Under EU procedures, all political decisions are subject to further legal and other processes and, when these are complete, come to the next available Council for formal adoption.  These so-called ‘A-List' items are not the subject of further discussion as they are outside the remit of the Environment Ministers.  For example, the Environment Council of 28 June also formally adopted decisions on matters such as trade policy, security policy, fisheries and the EU budget.As Ireland had not opposed the political decision on this specific issue at the Agriculture Council, it would not have been within the remit to have opposed its formal adoption at the Environment Council.  The countries that did so were simply confirming the position they had taken previously at the Agriculture Council.I set out my opposition to GMOs very clearly at the Environment Council when I led the support for Austria's statement on the need to address the safety concerns raised in relation to genetically modified maize.

No. 140 of 2006) give effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the national authority with overall responsibility for implementing the Regulations.  Implementation at local level is a matter for local authorities concerned, Dublin Airport Authority, the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency.The regulations require the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, e.g. large agglomerations, and major roads, railways and airports.  Article 10 of the 2006 Regulations requires certain noise maps, in respect of the largest agglomerations and infrastructure, to be made no later than 30 June 2007.  Details of each map must be provided by the noise-mapping body concerned to the Environmental Protection Agency no later than one month after the date on which the map was made.  Compliance with these requirements by the noise-mapping bodies concerned is a matter for the agency.The reporting requirements under the Directive, which are set out in Article 10, are also a matter for the agency under the 2006 Regulations.  The first report required under the Directive relates to the strategic noise maps to be made by 30th June 2007 and must be submitted by the agency to the European Commission within six months of that date.In summary, the time scale for the reporting obligations is that noise maps must be sent to the agency by the end of July 2007 and forwarded to the Commission by the end of December 2007.   There is no reason at this stage to believe that these deadlines will not be met.The noise-mapping bodies will be responsible for making strategic noise maps and action plans available to the public.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-07-05 00:00:00	Prelude	601	Article 9 and Annex II of Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste provides that packaging may not be placed on the market within the EU unless it complies with specified "Essential Requirements". Firstly, packaging must be prevented so that only the minimum amount necessary is used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery and presentation of goods. Secondly, packaging must be recoverable — either by material recycling, by energy recovery, by composting or by biodegradation.Packaging material intended to be designated as organically recoverable must be inherently and ultimately biodegradable. The material must be capable of disintegration in a biological waste treatment facility without detriment to the process and should not result in a negative effect on the quality of product.  CEN standards for conformity assessment of packaging and packaging waste with the Essential Requirements have been produced and a harmonised European Standard has been adopted and published.The Programme for Government gives a clear commitment to the implementation of effective waste management policies based on the waste hierarchy which places greatest emphasis on waste prevention, minimisation and reuse. We must further reduce our reliance on landfill and this can best be achieved by focusing in on the upper tier of the hierarchy.  The National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling, which comprises public / private stakeholders such as Repak, IBEC, producers, waste collectors, reprocessors, local authorities, the EPA and my Department, is currently developing a five-year strategy to achieve new higher targets for recovering and recycling packaging waste. Waste prevention and minimisation measures are at the heart of that strategy. It is hoped to have the Strategy completed before the end of 2007.The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Waste Report 2005, which was published in January 2007, reported that 925,221 tonnes of packaging waste was generated in that year, up from 850,911 tonnes in 2004 and from 819,863 tonnes in 2003.  While the evidence is that the trend over the period 2003 — 2005 in the production of packaging waste was upwards, there has also been a rapid increase in the population of this country, coupled with unprecedented economic growth and a significant rise in single person household occupancy.  All of these are contributory factors towards the recent growth in packaging waste arisings.However, some positive trends have emerged:  Ireland has enjoyed considerable success in recent years in meeting targets for the recovery and recycling of this significant waste stream.  Data from the EPA show that the 25% recovery target for 2001 set under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste was achieved and also that, with 59.9% recycling of packaging waste in 2005, Ireland has not only exceeded the 2005 recovery target of 50% set under the Directive but has virtually reached the 60% target required by end 2011, a full six years ahead of schedule.Ireland's recycling rate for packaging waste now compares favourably with many EU countries who have long been regarded as leaders in environmental protection.  In this particular area, Ireland was in sixth place amongst EU Member States in 2004 (the latest year for which data across all EU Member States is available), finishing higher than countries like Sweden, France, Denmark and Finland.My Department actively participated in, and contributed proactively to, discussions at EU level on a new Waste Framework Directive, on which political agreement was reached at the Environment Council meeting which I attended last week.  The objectives of the Directive include implementing a more ambitious and effective waste prevention policy in the EU. It will also encourage reuse and recycling of waste in line with the policies outlined in the EU Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste. It is likely that legislation will be required to transpose the new waste framework directive into Irish law once the proposed Directive has been formally adopted at EU level.

Under the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy Framework we have also set a target of 33% for the public sector.  I expect to launch this public consultation later this month.  In the meantime we will shortly submit to the Commission Ireland's Action Plan as required under the Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive specifying the energy efficient improvement measures being taken to reach the 9% Directive's indicative energy savings target by 2016.

A range of initiatives is already in place to support the development of the biofuels sector.The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two-year period under the scheme.  The Biofuels Mineral Oil tax Relief Scheme II was introduced in 2006, valued at over €200m. Under this scheme sixteen projects have been awarded excise relief to the period 2010.  The scheme will enable us to reach an initial target of over 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.  As a result of this scheme, biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.  The Government has also introduced a 50% VRT relief on Flexible Fuel Vehicles, which are capable of running on blends of up to 85% ethanol in petrol.  These vehicles are now available in Ireland from a number of car manufacturers.  The National Climate Change Strategy also commits to a realignment of VRT and Motor Tax to favour more energy efficient cars.  The Governments plan to introduce a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.Grants for the conversion of diesel engine vehicles to use Pure Plant Oil (PPO) have been made available by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), working with the four companies who were granted excise relief under the PPO category in the Pilot Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme.  The Department of Transport is also funding specific biofuels initiatives and will publish a Sustainable Transport Action Plan later in 2007.Under the Programme for Government we will introduce a minimum requirement for the use of Biofuels in State-owned and public transport vehicles.  We will introduce biofuels in blends of up to 5% in existing Local Authority and CIE fleets and will achieve 30% in new vehicle purchases by CIE.

They have been handed over to the managed services entity, eNet, who manage, market, operate and maintain Phase 1 of the networks on behalf of the State.Phase II of the MANs Programme, which involves the construction of about 90 networks is well advanced.  A number of MANs are currently under construction and the remainder are in the detailed design stage.My Department is currently undertaking a value for money and policy review on phase I.  The review is being carried out in close co-operation with the Department of Finance.  This review, along with other policy analysis being undertaken at present, will help to inform my decisions on future investment in broadband infrastructure.

The draft directive is currently being discussed at Council and the EU Parliament.The development of the postal market requires the availability of competitive, high quality products, while at the same time maintaining the universal service.  The current level of market opening has introduced new players with offerings that meet consumer needs and further market opening will provide additional opportunities for new and existing players.  The introduction of further competition allied with a modernised and customer-focussed An Post will provide the basis for the further development of the postal sector here.In light of these future developments we will keep under review our national postal strategy.

The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has previously undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the recently concluded group broadband scheme and investment in metropolitan area networks (MANs) in over 120 towns and cities under the Regional Broadband Programme (RBP).Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the RBP there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a new national broadband scheme (NBS) has commenced.  This scheme will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  The estimated timescale for the award of the NBS contract is December 2007, with roll-out of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter, subject to agreement with the chosen service provider.

As part of its analysis, the NPPB's advisers carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders both within the postal sector and outside it with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measures the likely costs and benefits of the introduction of such a postcode.  The upfront cost of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode has been estimated to cost in the region of €15 million.  There would also be ongoing annual maintenance costs but these would be met from revenues generated by the postcode manager.I am currently considering the issues involved and the next steps.

The BCI is charged under the corpus of broadcasting legislation with the orderly development of commercial and community broadcasting services in Ireland.In late 2003, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources initiated a review of the radio licensing framework in Ireland.  The issues arising during the course of this review informed the development of the draft general scheme of the Broadcasting Bill.  The draft general scheme was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in September 2006 for the purposes of public consultation under the eConsultation initiative.Head 67 of the draft general scheme proposes an amendment to section 6 of the Radio and Television Act 1988, to permit the proposed contract awards committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), at the direction of the BAI, to consider the amount of any once-off cash bid, periodic cash payment or royalty proposed by an applicant, as one of the selection criteria in a sound broadcasting contract award process.  This provision is intended to add to the range of discretionary mechanisms available to the BAI to reduce the likelihood of broadcast contract holders extracting supernormal profits from the sector.It is proposed to publish the Broadcasting Bill towards the end of this year having considered the Joint Oireachtas Committee's conclusions on the outcome of the eConsultation process.

This would enable ComReg to engage with the operators concerned in order to minimise disruption to consumers.The current position is that ComReg will consult shortly on the possibility of amending the format of the telecommunications general authorisation to provide for notification mechanisms to ComReg and, where appropriate, to end users in the event of significant service disruption.  The consultation will also address the possibility of mandating the preparation of suitable contingency plans by all authorised operators to address the risk of operator exit.  The general authorisation is the set of standard conditions and rules that all providers of electronic communications networks and services must abide by if they operate in Ireland.

The recently launched financial services venture, ‘Postbank', will entail the provision of a range of financial services through the post office network, using the An Post brand and other An Post assets.  This initiative offers a real opportunity for the growth and development of An Post and the post office network.  It is important that the network continues to offer new and enhanced services in order to diversify income streams and reduce reliance on existing contracts.

However, following notification from ESB earlier this month that its West Offaly and Lough Ree peat power plants at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro were experiencing outages on safety grounds, my predecessor requested that the Department's chief energy technical advisor undertake an assessment of the situation.  I have received his report which was carried out with full co-operation of the ESB.  Given the legal contractual position between ESB and the main contractor, the report is purely factual and does not make any determination as to the reasons for the plant problems.  I have asked the chief energy technical advisor to continue to liaise with the ESB on developments.I am advised by ESB that unexpectedly high levels of corrosion have been found in the 150 MW peat burning West Offaly Power Station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, and its 100 MW sister plant, Lough Ree Power at Lanesboro.  Following investigations, on 1 June 2007 ESB was advised by Foster Wheeler, who built and commissioned the plants, to take West Offaly Power out of service at once for safety reasons.  I understand that ESB and Foster Wheeler are working together to resolve the technical problem.  Experts have been engaged to study the processes at both plants with a view to finding a long-term solution.The company assures me it wishes to ensure that these temporary outages last no longer than absolutely necessary but the safety imperative makes it impossible to avoid loss of production while it seeks to solve the problem.I am also kept informed of any resultant implications for security of supply in relation to electricity.  In accordance with their statutory responsibilities, the power generation situation is continually monitored by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the independent transmission system operator (TSO), EirGrid, and is carefully managed from EirGrid's national control centre to ensure that security of supply standards are met. I am assured that the situation is being carefully managed by EirGrid to ensure that capacity meets demand at all times.

The INPC was paid in full for these assets by the purchaser on 16 July 2001.A legal undertaking by the purchaser, and its successors, to operate the facilities on a fully commercial basis for at least 15 years was a key element of this transaction.While the headline payment figure was $100 million (€117 million) for the 2001 transaction, it was always accepted that the net cash return arising from the transaction would be considerably less as the INPC was obliged to utilise most of the proceeds to discharge the company's significant debt (circa €88 million).  After taking account of all the company's matured liabilities it was estimated that the INPC would have funds in the region of €30 million.While the INPC paid €20 million to the Exchequer (2002), the company is not in a position to pay over remaining balances as, under company law, it must retain sufficient assets to meet potential liabilities.  The INPC retains rights and obligations under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) relating to the 2001 transaction.  It is the INPC's responsibility to enforce any INPC rights  and defend and/or negotiate any claims made as and when they arise.I would refer the Deputy to the annual reports and accounts of the INPC, laid before the Oireachtas, for the years 2001 to 2005.  The 2006 annual report and accounts will be available in the near future.

However, disposal of assets are subject to the Department of Finance code of practice for the governance of state bodies.  The code of practice sets out the obligations of the company with regard to asset valuation, transparency and competitive tendering processes.  The chairman is required to report to me annually on compliance with these obligations.The board of ESB announced recently its intention to divest four of its power plants, including Poolbeg, in accordance with the asset strategy agreement of November 2006 between the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and ESB.  The strategy is designed to ensure the progressive reduction in ESB's market share in power generation to around 40% in an all-island market context by 2010.  In addition to the expected positive impact on market conditions, it is the case that ESB PowerGeneration will also become more efficient and commercial in the process.The programme for Government mandates EirGrid to work in consultation with CER to develop a state owned landbank to facilitate new independent generation, including flexible/mid-merit plant.  This will complement the release of ESB sites under the CER-ESB agreement this year.The valuation of the Poolbeg site is a matter for the board and management of the company in the context of any commercial negotiations into which it might enter in its implementation of the terms of the CER-ESB agreement.
