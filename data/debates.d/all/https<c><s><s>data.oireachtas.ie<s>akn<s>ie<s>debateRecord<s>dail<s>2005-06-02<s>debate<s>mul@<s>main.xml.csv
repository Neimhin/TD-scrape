I understand there was no discussion of any consequence at that committee on Tuesday and the practical consequences of dealing with the disposal of every piece of electronic equipment in the country will cause major problems. I do not agree to this item being taken without debate. There was no debate of any relevance on Tuesday at this meeting and there are serious questions that must be answered from a practical perspective which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will fully understand in terms of the interpretation of the directive from local authority disposal points and disposal points provided by retailers. I ask that a debate of some time on this directive be held in the House. I object to it being passed without debate.

Many of the questions asked were not replied to satisfactorily. These regulations propose to deal with the issue of waste of electronic goods and provide for an arrangement whereby consumers can give back old electronic and electrical equipment in disuse. The idea behind the EU directive was that responsibility would be on the producer but it appears that in these regulations the Government is shifting responsibility on to the retailers. It is doing so in a way that will cause considerable confusion publicly and will not necessarily assist the consumer. I agree with Deputy Kenny that these regulations require debate in the House. The matter was not satisfactorily concluded at the committee.

The report is inadequate, it is one paragraph long. It needs to be debated on the floor of the House. In light of the latest judgment from the European Courts it is clear that, once again, our appalling record on the environment has been exposed. We are the environmental delinquents of Europe and the only response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to fast track incinerators. We need a more comprehensive response and that is why we will not accept this.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I too object to this being taken without discussion. I missed some of the committee meeting on 31 May as I had a request to make in the Dáil under Standing Order 31. It is clear there is not enough discussion on this matter. This item has the potential to deal comprehensively with the principle that the "polluter pays", placing the responsibility where it belongs, on the manufacturer who creates the pollution in the first instance. The discussions at the committee were inconclusive and further discussion is required.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government considered this motion last Tuesday. A division took place and the motion was passed that the regulations be referred back to the Dáil and Seanad with no further debate. The regulations provide the enabling framework for the transposition and implementation of two landmark EU directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment and on the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical equipment. The directive will come into operation on 13 August next so there is a tight timeline for finalising detailed regulations that need to be prepared.The directive is a producer responsibility initiative. It is not correct to say the Minister's intention is to pass on responsibility to the consumer. Producers will be responsible for the processing, recycling and disposal of equipment once it has been collected. Retailers will be required to offer one-for-one take-back of equipment similar to that which they are selling. Discussions are taking place between representative groups of producers and retailers on some aspects of the operation of the system. The Minister's concern is to implement the directives in a way that reflects the greatest possible consensus among various stakeholders on what will work most effectively and equitably. This matter has to be dealt with so the detailed regulations can be brought forward to implement the directive.

Only two fifths of the Cabinet members are present. The Taoiseach is absent, as is the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As of this morning, we have no chief executive-designate of the Health Service Executive. As Oscar Wilde said in another context, to lose one is bad, but to lose two is careless. We need a debate on this matter, as well as a debate on the issues arising from the report on nursing homes. We also need to have a debate on the findings of the Morris tribunal. I cannot agree that Dáil Éireann should rise today until 14 June and I object to the business of the House being dealt with in this fashion.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I also oppose the proposal for the adjournment of the House. There is a number of compelling matters that ought to detain the House next week. They include the news that the latest chief executive-designate of the Health Service Executive will not now take up the post, given the difficulties in the health service. To put it at its mildest, this is something that ought to be debated in the House. In addition, we must return to the nursing homes issue. The Minister for Finance will recall that in 1990 we had no difficulty in recalling the Dáil in mid-summer to take out a section of the Companies Bill. The measure was put through the House in one day to rescue Mr. Larry Goodman and his meat factories at that time.We currently have a Bill before the House, a section of which would deal with the issue of an independent inspectorate for nursing homes. If that matter cannot be taken next week, it must be taken before the House rises for the summer recess.Deputy Kenny referred to the Morris tribunal report. All of us in this House should hang our heads in shame because the Government has never provided time to debate in the House the tribunal's first report. There is no excuse for the House rising next week. It can meet as normal on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday if necessary to discuss an issue so fundamental for our democracy. I oppose the proposal.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The second report of the Morris tribunal reveals a very disturbing and shocking catalogue of events in the Donegal division of the Garda Síochána some eight years ago. In short, the report finds that there was a rush to judgment on the part of the Garda Síochána, but that there were also elements within the Garda who set out to frame Frank McBrearty junior and Mark McConnell for murder. While the report is reluctant to make a finding that the investigation was corrupt in its leadership, it finds that it was prejudiced and negligent in the highest degree.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government take the most serious view of this report and consider that both it and the first report should be urgently discussed in both this House and the Seanad. The Whips are now arranging this.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	That is a change.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Let me be clear, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government accept the findings of the report and will act on them. Last year, following the publication of the first report of the Morris tribunal, the Government dismissed a Garda superintendent. Another superintendent and a chief superintendent retired. The Garda Commissioner dismissed a number of members of garda rank. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said yesterday, the Government and the commissioner will now urgently consider the implications of the findings of this report for individuals.As the Minister also made clear, the response to this report must go far beyond the implications for individual members. Substantial reform is required and that is what is before this House in the Garda Síochána Bill, which I am glad to see passed Committee Stage last night. The Bill provides for the establishment of the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission to independently investigate complaints against members of the force. It also establishes a Garda Síochána inspectorate to examine and report on the effectiveness and efficiency of the force on an ongoing basis, a provision was introduced to the Bill in response to the first report of the Morris tribunal.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform strongly believes the establishment of these two bodies, together with the general reform in the Bill of the Garda Síochána and its relationship with Government, will transform the system of accountability and oversight of the force. He has also appointed a committee, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, to oversee the implementation of the Bill as soon as it is enacted. He will also bring forward an amendment to the Bill to require gardaí to account for their actions as members of the force. This new duty has been identified as vital by the tribunal and the proposed amendment to the Garda Bill will be a key response to its findings and recommendations. The Garda Commissioner will shortly outline a comprehensive package of management reform within the Garda Síochána in response to the first report of the tribunal.As the Minister said clearly yesterday on publishing this report, we have all been let down badly by the behaviour of a number of gardaí of different ranks in Donegal. The majority of men and women in the Garda Síochána, who have given and continue to give loyal and dedicated service to the State, will be particularly shocked and disappointed. The Minister also pointed out that it was only last week that we were reminded again of the dangers gardaí face in trying to protect the community, a situation in stark contrast to what is contained in this report from Mr. Justice Morris.It is difficult to overstate the disservice done to the ordinary decent members of the Garda Síochána by the shocking misconduct outlined in this report. The House will have the opportunity later this month to have a full debate on it and the Minister will outline his comprehensive response to this deeply troubling report.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I compliment Mr. Justice Morris on his clear and lucid report which is outstanding in the clarity of its language and the directness of its findings. This second report raises the most serious questions. I welcome the fact that there will be a full debate in the Dáil and Seanad and I expect that debate will be open-ended.The second report raises fundamental issues of the most serious import at every level. At the level of individual gardaí who are criticised in the report, they must be dealt with immediately by due process. There are serious systems issues raised about the operation of gardaí at senior level and about the relationship between the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.There are also serious issues raised about the political responses to the issues dealt with in these two reports, not least of which is a requirement of the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the current Minister, Deputy McDowell, who in his capacity as Attorney General advised the then Government on every occasion that there was no need for a public inquiry into these matters, to explain their response. The Government has a clear duty to respond quickly, properly and truthfully in respect of these matters. We also need statements from Deputies O'Donoghue and McDowell as to their reasons for setting their face against an inquiry. That should include reasons no legal aid was given to the McBrearty family, who, along with others, are vindicated by the clarity of the findings of the Morris tribunal.It is only fair to recognise that former Deputy, now Senator Jim Higgins MEP, and Deputy Howlin were two people who stood up firmly against a ferocious onslaught for an inquiry into this matter. Both of them deserve the credit of the people. We might not be discussing this but for their stubbornness to pursue the truth and to see it is brought forward.Fine Gael believes in a strong, effective and accountable Garda Síochána. We believe the integrity of the force should be beyond question and that it should have the trust of the people. Sadly, this report diminishes all those who have given outstanding service in terms of service to the country and public duty.We have supported the passage of the Garda Bill through the House in order to speed up the delivery of an independent and effective complaints system. It remains to be seen whether what passed through Committee Stage last evening is a vehicle of sufficient authority to deal with situations like this. I look forward to comprehensive debate in the House. Out of it, I hope the sea change that should come about, in terms of structures and structural management within the Garda and clarity of response and truth from Government, will see to it that integrity is restored to the only force we have to protect the citizen from intrusion by vandals, thuggery and whatever else.It is a shame that at the very highest level of where people expect absolute security and integrity, that the Morris report points clearly at a rottenness right at its core.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The former President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Morris, deserves the commendation and applause of the House. He probably despairs of the Legislature, however, given its response to his first report. The Minister for Finance told the House that the Government takes a most serious view of this second report and will act on it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said the exact same thing about the first report, but he did not act on it. I will not say that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, does not understand this matter, but it appears that it is not understood. It is not a matter of disciplining a few gardaí— that is not the issue.It is important to mention that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was not available for whatever reason to answer hard questions from a very respected broadcaster on "Morning Ireland" this morning, is usually happy to make himself available to Pat Kenny for a cosy fireside lecture to the nation. When efforts were made in this House to establish the tribunal now known as the Morris tribunal, Deputy McDowell opposed it tooth and nail. The legal representatives of the McBrearty family had made clear to him and to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, what was going on in County Donegal. The current and previous Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform resisted the establishment of the tribunal.Contrary to the suggestion of the Minister for Finance, the Garda Síochána Bill, which is currently before the House, does not amount to substantial reform. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has suggested that it is a significant reform that gardaí on duty will be required under the Bill to account for their actions, but nothing could be further from the truth. Members of the House should repeat publicly in this Chamber, in preparation for the full debate on this matter which we will have in due course, what they are saying in private.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The performance of the Garda Síochána is central to our democracy. It is clear that what has happened in County Donegal is a scandal that implicates the gardaí who were directly involved. However, it is also an indictment of the appropriateness in the 21st century of the structures which govern the force. The Government is not addressing that at all. The notion of a Garda authority was outlined in the Labour Party's proposals in this regard, which were published by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, five years ago. That notion was entirely different to the Garda Síochána Bill's pandering to a Garda inspectorate. The Garda authority, as proposed by Deputy Howlin, would be separate from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It would set a plan for policing, monitor standards and have a supervisory function. It would assess the effectiveness and efficiency of policing in this State in its annual report. That is absolutely central to our society.The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, refused to extend the purview of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard. It was excised from the terms of reference. It is plain from the quick glance I have had at the Morris report that Mr. Justice Morris is not just talking about a little local difficulty in County Donegal — it is far more serious than that. I have great respect for the Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, but I cannot understand why he said, as recently as three weeks ago, that the inquiry into the death of Mr. Richie Barron was thorough and efficient. The House should be profoundly disturbed by remarks of that nature.It is not too late to take advantage of the opportunity, presented by the Garda Síochána Bill, to take action in this regard. We need a commitment from the Government that it will implement all the recommendations of the Morris report. The Minister for the media took full credit yesterday for Mr. Justice Morris's report, even though he opposed the establishment of the tribunal. He could have imported the recommendations of the first Morris report into the Garda Síochána Bill, but he did not do so. As I said last week in Tralee, before the second Morris report was published, we need an independent commission on policing.

Mr. Chris Patten was able to complete his work in 18 months. Those of us who have spoken with Mr. Hugh Orde in recent times about developments in policing in Northern Ireland have learned a lesson about what might happen in this jurisdiction. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not adopted the Nuala O'Loan ombudsman precedent. The Garda Síochána Bill does not provide for a Garda authority. It is plain that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has captured the Minister, Deputy McDowell, despite all his talk and the fawning of some members of the media who are in thrall to him.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I would rather if the Ceann Comhairle saw his decision to allow this debate as a reflection of the necessity for the House to do justice to the serious report that was expeditiously produced by Mr. Justice Morris.Nothing in the new Garda Síochána Bill will address the core issue, which is that unaccountable power is a very dangerous thing. That the Bill is before the House at present gives the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform an opportunity to make changes. I ask the Minister to return to the House with proposals that do justice to Mr. Justice Morris's second report and take on board his recommendations. The Government should accept the need for a root and branch investigation of policing by establishing an independent policing commission. If we follow the methodology of Mr. Patten, we will know how long it will take. Certain people are willing to undertake the task of listening to ordinary citizens who, like the overwhelming majority of Members of the House, are entirely disposed to supporting the Garda.Mr. Justice Morris concluded his report by saying that terrible damage has been done to the Barron and McBrearty families and others. The House should be alarmed by the notion that a number of people could be in prison for a murder that never happened. Deputy Howlin's case, which relates to the protection of a whistleblower, is still before the Supreme Court. The case is still pending in the wake of the two Morris reports. The work of Deputy Howlin and Senator Higgins led to the establishment of the tribunal in the first instance. Mr. Justice Morris states at the end of his report that although serious damage has been done to the Barron and McBrearty families, the greatest damage has been done to conscientious members of the Garda Síochána.

This Legislature is not addressing that. The Government resisted the attempts of Deputy Costello and others to ensure that the first Morris report was debated in this Chamber.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I join other Members in paying tribute to Mr. Justice Morris on his fine second report, which reveals a litany of negligence, corruption, lies, deceit, cover-ups and appalling mismanagement. It exonerates Mr. McBrearty and Mr. McConnell and indicates that they were ruthlessly and viciously framed by the Garda. Their lives were made a hell. Were it not for the tenacity of Mr. McBrearty, Deputy Howlin and Senator Jim Higgins, this matter would not have come to light. I pay tribute to the Members of the Opposition for acting in the way they did.Mr. McBrearty came to our conference this year. After he spoke, he received a standing ovation. It was clear that this was a man who believed in his cause and believed in truth and justice. He was willing to pursue that cause until the very end. He is a very fine individual of whom this country should be proud. He is an ordinary person who battled against the odds and made great progress. He has not yet won totally, but he has been totally vindicated. However, this matter has a long way to go.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as Attorney General tried to stall Mr. McBrearty's quest for justice for as long as he could. The Minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to the altar of justice by Mr. McBrearty and others.Let us have the truth because, in a sense, the spin has worked. The Minister spoke yesterday as if he were the person who had pursued justice. There may be people who believe this, but let us put the record straight. This Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has behaved disgracefully. He has not acceded to the reasonable requests of the McBrearty family. He has let them down, so much so that they have called for his resignation. However, he can no longer procrastinate. What will be done? Will there be resignations and sackings from the Garda Síochána? Will we sit on this? Will the recommendations be implemented immediately or will there be a stalling process?In light of this damning report, the Green Party has called for a proper independent body to investigate fully complaints against the Garda. This would be along the lines of what has been established under Nuala O'Loan in Northern Ireland. which has worked effectively. The Minister resisted the proposal, yet what we heard from him this morning is that he will put forward a sticking plaster proposal by amending the Garda Síochána Bill. This does not go far enough. The Green Party and other parties in this House pushed for this and we will continue to push for proper accountability within the Garda Síochána. Root and branch reform of the Garda Síochána is required. We are not getting root and branch reform because the Minister is not a reforming Minister. He is the Minister for spin who does not deliver. We know from the figures given last week that crime is increasing. He has successfully spun his way throughout his Ministry and some people appear to believe he is doing a good job. I do not believe he is doing a good job. He is doing a very bad job for this country.The Green Party will continue to campaign for proper accountability and standards within the Garda Síochána. We hope the Government will listen to what we are saying at this stage. It is the second damning report from Mr. Justice Morris and it cannot be ignored.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Like previous speakers, I welcome the second report of the Morris tribunal. The belief that what happened in Donegal was as a result of a small number of gardaí effectively being out of control is something that needs to be examined. If that were the case, one would assume there was never a heavy gang in the State. While a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison in the 1970s, I witnessed at first hand Nicky Kelly, a colleague of Deputy Rabbitte, being helped up the stairs after being brutally assaulted and beaten by members of the special branch. Not one member of this heavy gang was held accountable for their brutal actions.This also calls into question the sacrosanct evidence accepted by the Special Criminal Court, where the word of a special branch man as against a defendant is taken as absolute, even to the extent that verbal admission, regardless of how it is extracted, is accepted as evidence to secure convictions. As elected representatives, we must ensure that what took place in Donegal and what is taking place in many other areas does not happen again. Since becoming a Member of this House, I have been trying to get the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the planting of a gun in a man's car, but to no avail. The gun was subsequently destroyed on the orders of the Minister. This speaks volumes about this man who opposed the setting up of this inquiry. He has resisted it from the beginning. As Deputy Gormley said, he is now saying he delivered on this.We must also examine the convictions secured on evidence produced by the senior gardaí mentioned in this report. Where do the victims stand in all of this? It is likely that many innocent people in many counties were convicted on verbal admissions or signed statements, regardless of how they were extracted. I attended meetings with Joe Costello in the 1970s and 1980s when there was an attempt to raise this issue, but the State stopped it. I recall the Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition speaking out against the heavy gang, but when it went into Government it did nothing about it.There are many issues to be examined in this regard. I suggest that the Morris tribunal should include in its terms of reference the collusion in the assassination of Donegal county councillor, Eddie Fullerton. He was shot dead in his home and nothing has been done about it. The investigation has been hindered because elements in control of the British forces were involved in the case. We must also examine the use of informers — people who would sell their soul for money. These people were being used without any accountability.

The debate must take into account all the aspects I have raised, including issues that were hidden by this House and the State in the past.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I refer to the Morris tribunal. The judge is fearless and his report points up serious misdemeanours on the part of gardaí in Donegal. Perhaps the time has come to consider that the circumstances are exceptional enough to sanction legal aid for the McBrearty family because, clearly, the tribunal would benefit from proper legal analysis of the issues facing Frank McBrearty and his family.However, I am concerned when everybody criticises the Garda because it is an exceptional public agency and morale is key to the proper discharge of its functions. Gardaí put themselves in harm's way to protect the public and their work is associated with constant danger. They put their lives at risk at times and it should be borne in mind that, while their behaviour should be analysed and scrutinised with due rigour, the Garda is a different public agency and its work is different from anything else.When I contributed previously to the debate on this legislation, I raised concerns about Part 3. I refer to the issue of anti-social behaviour orders, which are the subject of wide debate. They are good in theory and I support the inclusion of such orders in the legislation, which the Minister stated he would address later by way of amendment. However, a clear and simple definition of "anti-social behaviour" must be provided and obvious dangers must be avoided such as creating a charter for bullies in local communities. People forget that the Minister has proposed the equivalent of a yellow card for offenders so that they know if they reoffend, they face the possibility of criminal sanction but if they do not, there is no danger of them being criminalised. People have the will, volition and capacity to change their behaviour and the intention of a punishment, sanction or penalty is to change a person's behaviour.Some of the opposition to the ASBOs, particularly where children are concerned, is fair but some is unreasonable. A recent editorial in Hot Press compared ASBOs to kneecapping by provisional republicans. It said it was a State version of such street thuggery because the Garda would act as judge, jury and executioner. That is way over the top and that analysis is hardly worthy of comment, except that Hot Press goes into detail about its concerns about ASBOs.I agree with the need to review whether such orders should apply to children. Much has been said about the non-implementation of parts of the Children Act 2001, which is a concern for everybody. For example, the power of a court to bind parents to the peace has not been provided. That has been raised by many members of the public. The Act also provides for a parental supervision order to be imposed by a court but that has not been implemented. This would require parents to engage in parenting courses and courses to deal with addictions. Such orders would address concerns being expressed by the public without going down the road of using ASBOs for children.Restriction of movement orders were also provided under the Children Act 2001 but they have not been implemented. These would allow a court to restrict the movement of a child through a curfew if he or she has committed an offence. If these provisions were implemented, people's concerns would be reduced. Until the Children Act 2001 is fully implemented, the further criminalisation of children should be avoided. I do not support ASBOs for children but if they are introduced for them, they should only be used as a last resort.Many members have commented on the success of juvenile liaison officers throughout the system. Community service orders should also be considered for 16 and 17 years olds. They are provided for in legislation but they have not been implemented. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 identifies offensive conduct and threatening behaviour as a crime. In addition, when a person is brought before the District Court, he or she can be found guilty of an offence but the judge can exercise discretion to impose the Probation Act, which means no criminal offence has been recorded but if a further offence is committed within a certain period, the offender faces criminal sanction. This is a "yellow card" procedure in existing legislation. To think we are dealing with an empty canvas would be wrong.Regarding Part II of the Bill, the issue of a DNA database was discussed at a conference hosted last week by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Such a database is not included in this Bill but the Minister said on Second Stage that he hoped the Law Reform Commission would table proposals on the matter. I agree with this suggestion absolutely. I attended a lecture approximately ten years ago by the famous defence lawyer, Mr. Barry Sheck, who defended OJ Simpson. He described how a DNA database is of benefit to not only prosecution lawyers but also defence lawyers. I would welcome such a database. A forensic scientist in the UK commented that, so successful has such a database been in Scotland, police there cannot remember what it was like trying to prosecute and resolve investigations without one.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Criminal Justice Bill and the Garda Síochána Bill are major Bills that will have significant impact on our criminal justice system. The latter is reaching its final Stages in the Oireachtas and will likely pass all Stages by the summer recess. However, as has been said this morning, the Minister has promised a debate in the House on the second report of Mr. Justice Morris. That the changes proposed in the Garda Síochána Bill are thoroughly reviewed in light of this report is important. Having said this, the Bill goes some way towards answering Mr. Justice Morris's criticisms, particularly by way of the introduction of the Ombudsman Commission and the Garda inspectorate.I welcome the development of a new emphasis on community policing as it will be an invaluable tool for the criminal justice system. This is a long-term project and its benefit for crime figure reductions may not be seen for many years to come. The Minister and this Government have been losing the battle against crime until now. Muggings, robberies, increased drug trafficking and organised crime frighten and terrify many of our citizens. The Government has been in power for almost eight years. While in Opposition during the two years prior to that time, all the current Minister spoke about was zero tolerance regarding crime. However, only after eight years has it been realised that crime must be tackled at its source and that preventive measures are the most successful. Hence, the new emphasis on community policing.No one can accuse the Minister of not introducing enough legislation. We have buckets of it, most of which is not workable and of little effect because it is not resource-based. Consequently, it has no effect on real criminals. The new reliance on laws and regulations is having an effect on ordinary citizens. A phrase that is commonly used by an increasing number of ordinary citizens is that we are living in an open prison. This feeling is not due solely to legislation and amending legislation being introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The feeling has been created by the raft of legislation introduced by the Minister alongside what appears to be more and more regulations springing from the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Agriculture and Food, Finance, Transport and so forth on a daily basis.This perception is not helped by regulations and legislation that are badly thought out. Initially, we had legislation that allowed our children to eat with us in pub restaurants until 9 p.m. only. Some months after this, the time changed to 10 p.m. and, by the same stroke of the all powerful Minister's pen, the summer season was extended from 1 May to 30 September. The Minister also introduced a raft of regulations to clear up any misunderstandings there may have been about the original legislation. "Separate area" became a legal term. Under 18s could not hold a non-alcoholic disco in a bar or nightclub but, several months later, it became allowable if a new raft of regulations introduced by the Minister could be understood and implemented. We are reaching the stage when hoteliers, youth workers and gardaí must be experts in law to keep up with these changes and interpretations.One of the most serious problems for motorists is the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads. The insurance industry blames these for the massive increases in insurance prices, which affect everyone's personal budgets and the country's competitiveness as a whole. The penalty points system was to be the solution. Legislation was introduced and worked for a few months but the Government again failed to properly think out the legislation and provide the necessary resources to enforce it. The number of fatalities and injuries increased gradually until it is now as high if not higher than it was before the introduction of the points system.New speed limits were introduced recently without reclassifying regional roads. Many parts of the country do not have national primary roads or motorways. In some cases, they have exceptionally good regional roads, on which the general public is now obliged to drive at 80 km/h on journeys of up to 200 kilometres. Other smaller byroads where speed limits should be 50 km/h or less have speed limits of 80 km/h. When one raises this issue, the answer given is that these roads are being reclassified, most of which should be done by Christmas. How can the general public have respect for and confidence in the law when its experience of these Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats legislators is that they will probably get something wrong the first time or will not provide the resources to implement the regulations and laws they introduce?In light of this background, I will address some of the issues arising from this Bill. Following the collapsed Liam Keane murder trial, there were calls from the general public, the Garda and the Opposition for more powers for the Garda Síochána. This call occurred despite having introduced much significant legislation due to our history and successive Governments' efforts to quash terrorism. After the murder of Veronica Guerin, there were more calls for greater powers to be given to the Garda and for more legislation. Further legislation followed the atrocity in Omagh. One would think that these laws together would be sufficient to contain the lawlessness we face today but such is not the case. The general public and the Minister himself feel that events are out of control. Murders, robberies and muggings are constantly in the headlines. The Minister continues to get the support from a large section of the public and the Opposition because everyone hopes that what the Minister refers to as a final and comprehensive package of legislation will solve the problem eventually.In desperation, the Opposition and sections of the general public support this Bill. Due to this feeling, people are prepared to accept laws that infringe upon their individual rights to a certain extent. Some aspects of this Bill seem reasonable in current circumstances. There is a statutory power to preserve crime scenes, a general power regarding search warrants and the curtailing of the right to freedom by increasing detention periods to up to 24 hours for arrestable offences. On closer examination, these are worrying changes.A person's home enjoys special status under the Constitution. It is protected by Article 40.5, which clearly states that "the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered...". There is no doubt that taking the power from the Judiciary, an independent arm of the State, and giving it to superintendents of the Garda Síochána considerably weakens this constitutional provision. It puts power totally in the hands of law enforcers, with no judicial or lay involvement. This may work well when the institutions of the State and the Garda Síochána are beyond reproach. However, there have been times in the past — and perhaps there may be in the future — when this was not the case. It is at times of difficulty that constitutional rights protect the ordinary citizen from potential abuses by the State and its law enforcement agencies.The basic civil right to liberty will be eroded by the extension of detention periods. Again, this is not such a serious problem when organs of the State are beyond reproach. However, the right to freedom and the presumption of innocence are fundamental civil liberties designed to protect the ordinary citizen when State institutions are suspect or law enforcement excessive.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform admits that changes in the law allowing the Garda Síochána to take bodily samples, such as saliva, from those in custody will help to create a DNA database. I accept that this is a debate for another day and another Bill, as argued by the Minister, but the changes in this Bill are laying the foundation stones for a DNA database.Section 15, part 3 is to be welcomed in the present circumstances. There is no doubt that subversive organisations and barbaric criminal gangs, not that there is any difference between them, have too often intimidated witnesses to such an extent that they fear for their lives if they appear in court to give evidence. As the Minister pointed out, the need for provisions of this nature was highlighted by the collapse of the Keane murder trial, when witnesses who had previously given statements to the Garda Síochána recanted and refused to give evidence against the accused in court.However, agreeing to this provision violates the right of a person to confront his accuser. Powers like these should be used sparingly and only on a temporary basis and therein lies another problem. Once legislation is passed, it is seldom repealed. Most of the anti-terrorism Acts introduced over the years are still part of our legal system. One solution to the problem of the infringement of civil liberties that this Bill creates is to build in a clear provision that these sections will be thoroughly reviewed on a two yearly basis.On section 30, the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, Deputy O'Keeffe, has made it clear that the party does not believe that arms control should be dealt with in the context of this Bill. Fine Gael will, if necessary, introduce a Private Members' Bill to deal with the firearms issue in a far wider and more comprehensive manner.On the face of it, section 29 appears to be reasonable in providing for on-the-spot fines for public order offences. The question is, however, what is a public order offence? There are many different interpretations. The Garda Síochána and judges disagree on this issue on a daily basis. Individual gardaí will differ in their understanding of what constitutes a public order offence. Some members of the Garda Síochána will maintain that a group of young people arriving into their home town, having won a match, singing and celebrating after dark, is a public order offence. Other members of the force would totally disagree with this. Therefore, very strict guidelines must be given to the Garda Síochána to ensure an even-handed approach to the issuing of on-the-spot fines.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not clarified whether payment of an on-the-spot fine will result in a criminal or other record for the person involved. In this context, we are mainly dealing with young people, many of whom still live with their parents, are in education and dependent on their parents. Many more have full-time or part-time jobs. They might decide that, even though they consider themselves innocent, the easiest solution is to pay the fine. Then there would be no need for explanations to their parents and no risk of exposure in the local press. A record of any offence can have serious consequences for young people. It can affect their work, educational or travel prospects. I urge the Minister to examine these issues and confirm that the payment of on-the-spot fines will not create a record for the individual involved.If the introduction of new laws would solve our law and order problems, then we would live in a crimeless society at this stage. We should look in other directions for solutions — better education, particularly at primary school level; better sporting facilities for young people; more gardaí on the streets; more community gardaí, well resourced and independent from the mainstream force; a re-vamp of the Garda training regime, to introduce more specialisation and professionalism; and more equipment and technology of all descriptions. Otherwise, we will perpetuate the myth that legislation will solve our problems.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I wish to share time with Deputy McGuinness.I find it unusual to take part in a Second Stage debate on the Bill currently before the House because, having reviewed the Minister's speech on the matter, the legislation that eventually emerges from this process will include many new provisions, therefore changing much of the Bill. While I support the general thrust of the Bill as currently published, I am not willing to write the Minister a blank cheque for the issues he is concerned with or, for those that have been referred to in the media. Therefore, in addition to commenting on the provisions of this Bill, I will refer to additions that can be made to make it more effective.Everyone agrees there is no acceptable level of crime and any fear of crime within a community is unacceptable. Unfortunately, despite the fact that levels of crime have fallen in recent years, people's expectations of being victims of crime continue to grow. For this reason, I am in favour of measures that will enable a more effective fight against crime. It is our job to make provision to protect people while, at the same time, we consider ways to successfully prevent crime and, more importantly, to prevent people becoming involved in criminal activity. In this context, I refer to some of the major issues included in the Bill before the House, especially as they relate to children.A recent development in policing may be the most fundamental advance for communities for several years, namely, the increase in co-operation between the Garda Síochána, local authorities and community representatives. The development of joint policing committees is an excellent initiative for which I warmly compliment the Minister. These committees will provide a forum where the Garda Síochána and the local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing issues such as estate management, planning, traffic, street lighting and public order. Their role is to facilitate discussion on matters of local concern and to develop new strategies to combat problems.I represent Dublin North West, where incidences of anti-social behaviour and low level crime have caused serious problems in some areas. However, contact among local residents associations, garda liaison officers and public representatives has been of tremendous benefit in combatting such offences. I regularly attend the Safer Ballymun and Safer Finglas meetings aimed at increasing local co-operation with the Garda Síochána and building trust in the authorities in the area. On both counts, they have been very successful. At these meetings, we have recognised that crime and anti-social behaviour are societal problems and therefore need to be dealt with by society as a whole. We have recognised that if we lumber the entire responsibility on to the Garda, we do ourselves and our community a grave disservice. In saying that, I also believe that Garda numbers and visibility are of the utmost importance. I am an ardent supporter of community policing, which has long been treated as a poor relation of the Garda services. In the past, community policing has lacked resources, promotional prospects and status within the force. If we are to keep the Garda on board in a real partnership with the community, we must ensure community policing receives as much funding and support as necessary. I know the Garda budget is now at an all-time high and I call on the Minister to ensure that funding continues and grows in order for community policing to flourish.I compliment the Minister for introducing Operation Anvil. In the last two weeks in my constituency it has been successful in combating a number of issues that have been of concern to us for some time. While I do not wish to stray into the issues raised by the publication of the report of the Morris tribunal, it is imperative that every measure is taken to ensure that trust is restored and maintained in the Garda force.I wish to deal with children in our criminal justice system. There has been much debate over the last two months regarding the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders or ASBOs. Before anyone gets into the rights and wrongs of this scenario, I wish to discuss how children are treated in our criminal justice system. The sad truth is that the Children's Court system is failing our young people. Rather than removing them from criminal activity it is causing them to enter an endless cycle of offending and detention. This is the awful reality that many people face every day. Many of my young constituents are caught up in this system, their families are affected entirely by it and I cannot let the opportunity pass by without discussing it.A recent study of approximately 1,000 cases in the Children's Courts in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford has highlighted that a lack of support and early intervention for young offenders means that detention is not being used as a measure of last resort but rather as a measure of system breakdown. The report found that there has been a significant increase in detention rates from 10% to more than 20% in recent years, rising to almost 30% if suspended sentences are included. The majority of the cases in the study involved young males aged between 16 and 17 who tended to come from backgrounds of disadvantage and poverty. A range of problems was prevalent among the children studied, including mental health issues, behavioural problems and alcohol and drug addiction. Despite presenting with such problems, the courts did not appreciate the complexity of the issues facing the child in many cases. While few cases overall resulted in custodial sentences, many of the children were granted bail with conditions such as a curfew, restrictions on movement or a direction to stay away from alcohol and drugs. This is the type of restorative justice that we hope will stop children taking up criminal activity in the first place.However, the reality is that this is not happening. The lack of bail support and lack of resources for the probation services means that many of these conditions are too difficult, time-consuming and too draining and are setting up young people to fail. If these children end up serving a custodial sentence, the possibility of them halting their criminal activity as adults is very slight. For example, if we look at figures from Trinity House in Lusk, which is one of the few links in the juvenile justice system that experts believe to be working, almost one half of the offenders there end up in adult prisons within six months of their release. Even if they avoid further detention, they often end up in health board care or become homeless. This is unacceptable and cannot continue.Before we introduce another way in which our children may end up in the criminal justice system — through ASBOs — the Minister should ensure the Children's Court system is radically improved because it is currently failing children and us. Having spent 30 years in primary teaching, most of which was spent in youth work, I believe that 99% of young people are not intent on causing wanton damage even when they are playing loud music and wearing hooded tops. They can be intimidating but there is a big difference between that and being involved in anti-social behaviour.There is growing concern about incidents of anti-social behaviour. In my constituency, I am aware of many vulnerable people, particularly old people, who are subjected to serious nuisance and forms of harassment, which can cause great distress. However, I also know that when it comes to resolving juvenile crime, it is best to use a holistic approach and keep everyone — gardaí, parents, community representatives and schools — involved. This is just a short list of the various groups that need to be involved in dealing with juvenile crime. We need to combat anti-social behaviour but we also need to provide a range of responses that can be tailored by the courts to meet the needs and circumstances of individual young people.Where the behaviour of young people is difficult to manage or out of control but is not criminal, the Children Act 2001 already contains progressive measures to address this situation by diverting them from future criminal activity. Garda diversion programmes, family conferences and community sanctions are some of the many ways we can decrease anti-social behaviour and low-level crime. The Act should be fully implemented and resourced to allow this system to work. Finding resources can often be difficult but in 2002 the annual cost to the State of keeping a boy in Trinity House was nearly €250,000 and these funds could be better used by resourcing the Children Act.I congratulate the Minister on his efforts thus far in introducing legislation to increase our fight against crime, increasing the Garda budget, introducing joint policing committees and supporting community policing. All these measures will certainly make the fight against crime more effective. While I support the thrust of the Bill, I urge the Minister to take the concerns of many Members about certain elements of it on board. I also ask him to consider the points I have raised about our current juvenile justice system and current legislation covering juvenile crime before introducing further ways to deal with these young people. I look forward to keeping a close eye on the debate on this Bill and as the debate develops, to seeing the fruits of this in the final Bill presented to the House.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	In general I welcome the content of this Bill. The Bill has some aspects that I am concerned about and some aspects I would like to see debated fully. Some of the suggestions made by the Minister regarding additions to the Bill need to be teased out, perhaps on Committee Stage. This is where that will be done. The Minister and those who represent him here during this debate should take note of some of the concerns expressed and suggestions put forward in an effort to improve what is very important legislation.There is no doubt that in the context of contemporary society there is a need for strong legislation in this area. Decent people within our communities are affected on a daily basis by serious crime, vandalism of one kind or another and anti-social behaviour, which is the biggest problem facing every one of us and the communities we represent. The Bill speaks heavily of all of the penalties for those found guilty.In the context of the unfolding debate on the report of the Morris tribunal, we need to focus on the side of the citizen who might find reason for complaint about some aspects of the implementation of this law and how they are treated. I refer to the Butler case in Kilkenny. The way in which the family's complaint was handled by the current arrangement within An Garda Síochána was entirely unsatisfactory. The hearing the family received was extremely poor, did not recognise the complaint made or address the issues raised. The family received a very poor response from the Garda authorities and the complaint unit that exists within An Garda Síochána. I urge the Minister, as I did in a previous debate, to respond in a more positive and proactive way to the correspondence I sent on behalf of the family to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I encourage him to conduct a separate investigation into the issues raised to ensure justice is done with regard to the death of that young man on a road in Kilkenny. Essentially, what is in question is the quality and thoroughness of the investigation into the young man's death. I am flagging the issue for the Minister and am asking him again in a constructive way to look at the correspondence I sent his Department and determine if the family can be assisted in any other way.One of the specific issues mentioned by the Minister was anti-social behaviour orders. I fully support strengthening the Garda position in dealing with those who are involved in anti-social behaviour but this is a blunt instrument and it should not be applied in the way suggested. It is insufficiently defined and significant harm could be done to young people in this country. It is the wrong way to deal with anti-social behaviour. We should examine the legislation that is already in place but not implemented. This Bill offers an ideal opportunity to examine that legislation and to spend the money where it needs to be spent, that is, in supporting gardaí in a positive way and, in turn, extending that support to the communities we represent.Community policing has been greatly praised in debates in this House but it is hugely under-resourced. As soon as there is a community garda in the community, he is changed or shifted or his tasks are re-prioritised so he has little or no time for the community aspect of his work. In many cases, gardaí have been instrumental in stewarding young people who have gone off the rails, as it were, back into a normal code of conduct that is acceptable in the community.The system in the UK is often offered as an example of the use of anti-social behaviour orders. However, a number of areas in the UK take a different approach to the concept. There is a softer approach in the initial phases. All the legislation in that regard and, in particular, the relevant funding must be examined. A partnership must be established between the local branch of the Health Service Executive, the local authorities, the Garda and the communities but that is not happening on a wide scale. If one writes to the local authority or the Health Service Executive about an anti-social behaviour matter, one will be referred to the Garda. If one talks to the Garda about it, they are simply under-resourced. They do not have the community gardaí needed to deal with this growing problem. It is an issue that must be tackled but I do not believe the blunt instrument of anti-social behaviour orders is the mechanism by which we will achieve greater co-operation within our communities. The Minister should take note of that.It is a pity that in tandem with the debate on this Bill a public debate is taking place outside the House about the liquor licensing proposals. Discussing anti-social behaviour on the one hand and establishing café bars throughout the country on the other does not exactly gel. I do not know who came up with the idea of café bars but it certainly did not arise in my constituency and it would not relate to my constituency.

Little analysis has been carried out of what is happening in society and in the communities we represent.If Ministers listened to the general debates that take place on these issues in this House, blunt instruments such as this would not be used to deal with problems. There is no regard even for young children. In England, photographs of young children are distributed in the housing estates to implement anti-social behaviour orders. Is that what we want here? I think not. Consider that in the context of the all-night drinking sessions that take place. If gardaí were supported, the vandalism and anti-social behaviour would ultimately be defeated.Many of the complaints that arrive on the desks of superintendents and gardaí do not get a response because the Garda simply does not have the force to respond. Kilkenny has one of the new bicycle squads. They are a great idea. Gardaí are able to get around to the various communities and flashpoints in housing estates late at night and particularly at weekends. They can deal with problems in a sensible way. If such initiatives were extended and properly funded, local authorities were properly funded for the management of their estates and community groups were assisted and funded, there would be less anti-social behaviour.There is no need for café bars. It would be helpful to the trade and to communities if the Minister were to state clearly that this idea will be abandoned. It would be worthwhile.

There is still a national Parliament in this country and we must debate it in full. I do not care who makes the final decision but we make the first decision. The first decision on anti-social behaviour orders and the daft notion of café bars must be debated fully in this House. The decision must be taken here, not outside the House. It should not be floated for months to damage the morale of communities and those involved in the economics of the argument. The issue should be defused sooner rather than later. That is my view and it is the view of many other Members of the House. Just as the Minister can state his point of view, Members on this side of the House can do likewise. That is what I am doing in this debate.

Like the previous two speakers, while I fully accept the need to deal with the crime and security problems in this country, and all Members receive complaints daily in this regard, there should be regard for the rights of the citizen. We should also use this opportunity to focus on what causes the problems and not condemn the entire public as the cause.It is sad that in light of recent revelations, we are conducting this debate in the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If the positions were reversed and the Government parties were on this side of the House, they would be clamouring for the resignation of everybody from the Taoiseach down. There is not a word of apology or recognition from the Government benches. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform jumps around like an excited cuckoo briefing the media but then walks away in the face of the most damning criticism in the report published in the last 24 hours. It is timely that we are discussing a related issue this morning.Some Members have tried to bring these issues to the attention of the Minister over recent years. How often must one say these things or to whom must one say them? All these issues were brought to the attention of the current and previous Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The issues raised this morning were raised by Deputy Howlin and Senator Jim Higgins over the past five years and are typical of the type of issues that have been raised but to which the Ministersdid not respond. It is another damning indictment.However, let us consider the need for this Bill and what it will achieve. I believe it will achieve nothing. Crime here is appalling, as the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, should well know. The reason is that powerful criminals get away. Daily, the young see major crime barons plying their wares with impunity, which is appalling. It is only in recent times, after continuous peppering from the Opposition, that there has been any attempt to come to grips with the problem.We know about the crime barons living abroad, in Spain and elsewhere, and we are told the authorities know all about them. If the authorities know about them, they should do something about them. Any young potential criminal growing up can read a headline about these criminals and learn how to live — learn how to drive a top of the range car, keep a couple of boats or a few horses, and live high on the hog. That is what it means to them: crime pays, and it is paying all the time.The present Minister has failed to deal with the issue, like his predecessor as Minister, Mr. zero tolerance. There is an attitude that we should abolish petty crime with anti-social behaviour orders. This area has been chosen because it is very easy to deal with. However, it is where the potential fault lies in the Bill.

I brought to his attention on more than one occasion the use of senior gardaí in totally inappropriate areas, as did other Members. Let us not cod ourselves about who is responsible for deployment.While we are on the subject, I do not want Ministers telling the House they have no responsibility for a certain matter and that it is the responsibility of some official. It is the responsibility of the Minister who sits in this House, and nobody else's. It is time this was recognised. Far too often, as when answering written questions, Ministers claim they have no responsibility. That is right; they have little responsibility and they are showing it. The sooner Ministers come to grips with the situation, recognise and accept their responsibilities, and do something about them, the better for themselves and everybody else.

For the past five or six years, the appearance of a variety of guns in the pursuit of crime has become commonplace. I do not know how many times this must happen before it is decided something should be done. There should be an add-on or addendum to the Bill in this regard.A person does not saw the barrel off a shotgun to convert it into an electric razor or to use it as a telescope. It is done for a particular purpose — to kill people. I stand over the actions of the Garda Síochána in regard to a recent robbery, after which many began wondering whether firearms should have been used. The fact is that people with guns were at that place, on that day, to kill people. The guns were for no other purpose; they were not to scratch an ear but to kill people. It is tough. What resulted is what happens in that kind of situation. Apparently, at long last, the Minister suddenly realised: "Oh, gosh. There are serious guns out here. What is the problem? Let us do something about it."The designation of a crime scene is dealt with in section 4. The issue has much wider connotations than are recognised or understood, for example, the designation of a crime scene in a certain place in County Donegal, which was referred to in the report we all read of this morning. In that case, how was it decided there would not be a crime scene? Why was the crime scene not preserved? Am I to presume that the need for the Bill is as a result of that case? If so, it is a mistake. Adequate legislation was already in place to deal with such matters. Countless crime scenes have been preserved throughout the country and the world without any such legislation. I am not sure how section 4(3) defines a crime scene. For example, an area where it could be concluded a crime had taken place might be designated as a crime scene. Various issues follow on from there. To what extent is it intended to embellish this section and to operate it? I do not know.The Minister of State interjected during the contribution of his Fianna Fáil colleague some minutes ago in regard to local authorities and administration at local level. He should know that the local authorities are seriously and sadly lacking in regard to the job they have already been given to do, for a variety of reasons. They are about as capable of running other services as the House is capable of debating a critical issue at the time it arises, which is fairly incapable. When we deal with such matters, we need to think seriously about the root causes and what can be done in this regard.I refer to juvenile crime. I have found with increasing frequency that schools and teachers can identify children who might become involved in juvenile crime at an early stage. The children might have behavioural, attention or communication difficulties or minor disabilities, but not sufficiently to justify having special needs treatment. In that situation, a child becomes insular, protective and a loner, and will seek attention in many and various ways. While I am not suggesting children are not entitled to do this, I point to the pattern of behaviour.We hear references to children wearing hooded jackets. This is a sign of withdrawal. One does not have to be a rocket scientist or psychologist to figure that out. Why do they do this? It is not necessarily to ape "the general" or somebody who walked around with a cover over his head; it is simply that the child is withdrawing into himself or herself, and seeking refuge.Anti-social behaviour orders will not do much to deal with this. In fact, they could alienate the young entirely. We were all young once and can remember that time, despite it being long ago — longer for me than for the Minister of State, who might remember it more vividly. However, if a young person has an unhappy incident with the law, it can taint his or her attitude for ever. This is a potentially serious problem which society cannot afford at present.A UK police chief constable on his retirement some years ago spoke about law enforcement, penalty points and the civic-spirited attitude of the public to the law, which was always supportive. However, he said the increased incidence of motorist pursuit had resulted in far less co-operation with the police than ever before.I am worried about anti-social behaviour and am fully aware that something must be done. I have received countless complaints from elderly people who have lived in their own houses all their lives who are now afraid to walk the footpaths because of the antics of a few people.Deputy McGuinness and others mentioned the development of café bars. I cannot understand how this notion was conjured up. People cannot smoke in enclosed spaces and have been driven out on to the footpaths, although I do not know whether they will be allowed to smoke there either. Café bars will be an extension of drinking emporiums on to the footpath. Is this a desirable development at this time? I am as liberal as anybody else, but for some unknown reason the more accessible drinking becomes the worse becomes people's behaviour. It is virtually impossible to control the situation.I do not blame young people for all of the problems. Also to blame are the huge establishments who pour 600 or 700 people out on to streets at the same time late at night or early in the morning. These people congregate outside, which is when the trouble starts. I dispute the Minister of State's suggestion that the influence of publicans is changing our view. Publicans have done their best and have been very successful in ensuring that the law is observed. However, there is little control over establishments which pour hundreds of people out on to the footpaths in the early hours of the morning. Garda cars and vans are called because disputes arise in this situation. The more people that come out of such establishments at the same time the greater the opportunity for incidents to occur.One does not solve crime with new legislation, unless a technical issue pops up and is evident to all. I get suspicious whenever somebody introduces legislation to do something that should have been done before. This is a smokescreen behind which everybody can hide and say we can do nothing, our hands are tied so we need new legislation. Over the years, Departments have sought legislation to address issues that seemed to stare everybody in the face. However, the issues continued afterwards and still nothing happened. Nothing will happen unless the will is there to enforce the legislation.From time to time the Minister has lectured us on the various means of dealing with illegal behaviour. One of crime's greatest assets in recent years has been the ability of criminals to convert their activities into solid assets. They have been able to buy property, launder ill-gotten gains, live a high lifestyle and achieve respectability on the basis of funding obtained by illicit means. I have tabled a series of questions on the issue over the years, as I have regarding gun law, organised crime and the spread of the drugs problem. The issues are inter-related. As it stands, there is not much in this Bill that will address them.The Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful, but is it adequately resourced to do its job? If one considers the number of major robberies on this island in the past six months, the amount of stolen money must be close to €70 million or €80 million. That is a large amount and has much influential buying power. However, it is virtually certain that all of it has been laundered and is now legitimate. It has been converted into real estate, hotels and various business premises and is now respectable money. Are adequate resources in place to deal with the issue? As I said earlier, senior gardaí should be deployed to deal with these pressing and urgent matters. They should be fully aware that there is support for them to do so.A number of major criminals have multiple investments. There have been some 5,148 suspicious financial transactions in the past 12 months. Of those, only a quarter were investigated. This is appalling considering there is €60 million to €70 million of illegal money floating around. It represents serious neglect on the part of the Minister.We must deal with the issue of juvenile crime sooner rather than later. Arresting every child or teenager in the country will not solve the problem. Neither will it be resolved by introducing a custodial system that does not have an educational element. It is necessary to identify the children at risk in our schools with a view to giving them encouragement, back-up and education.

Otherwise what John Lonergan has been telling us for years will continue, not only in the precincts of our prisons but all over the country. The Minister of State should convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he should do something about the matter urgently. Otherwise we will have more serious problems and more of this type of legislation, which is a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the broad provisions of the Bill and on the issues of crime, law and order. Many of the provisions are very welcome. Section 4 has been long overdue in that there have been numerous cases in recent times where forensic evidence at a crime scene was not preserved and could be tampered with or was exposed to the elements. Vital information and clues that could have led to a prosecution were removed either covertly or by other means.In terms of addressing the problems of serious crime, the balance of power seems to be tipped in favour of the accused as opposed to being in favour of society at large. There can be good reasons for the public assuming that, particularly when cases on which they believe convictions will be secured are overturned on appeal on what could be considered a technicality. That diminishes the public's confidence in the Garda Síochána pursuing a case, bringing it to court and securing a successful prosecution.As technology and forensic science advances, the need to preserve a crime scene is becoming more valuable. We did not have the capability of DNA testing in the past. Only basic physical evidence was gathered but with the advances in technology and forensic science, the protection of a crime scene is vital. Section 4 provides for that in a sensible manner. A garda who is in a lawful place, and assuming a crime has been committed, can preserve that crime scene and the order can be extended for a number of hours by a superintendent seeking same from a District Court.I welcome other sections in the Bill. I referred to section 13 earlier. On the area of DNA and forensic samples, perhaps we should consider the question of trying to create a proper DNA data bank. Figures show that where a large data bank has been built up over years in other countries, and used very effectively, it has led to serious crimes being prosecuted successfully. Experts and scientists would agree that DNA testing is a very accurate way of identifying a suspect or eliminating a person from an inquiry. It can work both ways.Civil liberties groups and the Human Rights Commission have made valuable points and will make submissions to the Law Reform Commission on this area. If a citizen suspected of committing a crime is brought into a station and provides DNA sampling voluntarily, the test can prove his or her innocence, assuming he or she is innocent, and he or she can be released. DNA testing would advance people's rights and ensure that a person is not detained for longer than necessary if the DNA system can be pursued through voluntary codes.Section 13 also provides for saliva sampling. I was amazed to discover that it was considered an intimate act to remove saliva from a person. Hair follicles can be removed now also, which would be considered another useful source of DNA. Those procedures are very important to the Garda Síochána in trying to fight crime.I saw some statistics recently which indicated that successful prosecutions were obtained in Scotland in a number of serious crimes through the use of DNA testing. One person who had committed numerous rapes was eventually detected many years later through DNA sampling. We must give the Garda Síochána the opportunity to use all available science and assist it in every way in that regard. The public should not be concerned about abuse of that since it is scientific more than anything else. We should be supportive of DNA testing and encourage people to voluntarily provide DNA samples if they are suspects in a crime. That is something we should push forward as much as possible.Some very responsible contributions were made to the debate but some Opposition Members complain that crime is rampant in our society. I reject that. Statistics show that crime is not rampant in our society. Our streets, compared with most European countries, are very safe. We have issues with public order offences and anti-social behaviour, but in general most citizens feel reasonably safe in their communities in comparison with other large cities throughout Europe.There is no doubt there has been an escalation of firearms crimes and that since the ceasefire in the North, some of the arms used by paramilitaries have been siphoned off to a number of serious criminal elements rather than being decommissioned. There is a proliferation of guns in society and it is a problem we should acknowledge and address. I am aware the Minister is examining the possibility of having a firearms amnesty. I would support such a measure. It was used in Britain some years ago for knives and thousands of lethal weapons were handed in voluntarily. If we had an amnesty here before we enact serious provisions in legislation to deal with people who hold illegally held firearms, it might assist in taking a number of weapons out of circulation.I must refer to Operation Anvil and the deaths of two suspects in a post office raid. We must be conscious of the fact that if people go out one morning to raid a post office using firearms, the State has a duty to support the Garda Síochána in every way possible. They should try to apprehend the suspects without a firefight but in the event of that happening, gardaí have every right to defend themselves using lethal force if necessary. We should not jump to conclusions immediately about that. There is a mechanism in place whereby a senior Garda member can investigate such incidents. People will be satisfied with that because such an investigation should be done by an outside body. I believe more independent people should investigate such incidents but firearms are seldom used by members of the Garda Síochána. We have had two deaths recently but attacking the gardaí involved as if they were the ones who did the wrong deed on that morning is despicable. We must be supportive of the Garda. We cannot ask members of the force to take on serious hardened criminals who intimidate communities and arms of the State and then assume they overreact when they use force. If we are to be supportive of the Garda Síochána, we should be more moderate in our language and not jump to conclusions.With regard to the Morris tribunal, that issue is something we must address also. The majority of people have confidence in the members of the Garda Síochána. Its members have served the State well over the years. There is no doubt that developments in the Morris tribunal and its findings have cast a cloud over the force and, more than anybody else, the members of the Garda Síochána are hurt by the findings. They feel betrayed by a number of senior members of the force in that this type of activity could take place through the ranks of the Garda. We must accept that will damage the public's confidence in the Garda Síochána to a certain extent but we set up a tribunal, it has reached conclusions and we should deal with those and implement any recommendations. I have no difficulty with an independent ombudsman investigating complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. Most members of the force have no difficulty with it either because they take pride in their uniform and in their sworn oath to uphold the laws of the State and protect our society. We should move expeditiously on that because this cloud has been hanging over the Garda for some time. We have the tribunal findings and we should act swiftly on them.Anti-social behaviour has been spoken about on numerous occasions recently. Members on all sides of the House want to speak about and highlight the problem because it affects all public representatives. Not a day or a week goes by when Deputies from urban areas, particularly those representing rural areas with large conurbations, are asked for transfers by people in local authority houses because of anti-social behaviour and intimidation. The ambience in these estates is being ruined by a few individuals and we have failed to address that problem. The Garda will say it has more serious crimes to deal with and that resources must be used in the fight against serious crime. I accept that, but if we do not address the root problems and deal with juveniles who get involved in minor anti-social behaviour, many of them will end up committing more serious crime which will bring them into the criminal justice system.Some people oppose the measures on anti-social behaviour orders, which would be issued in the civil courts initially and, if breached, could become a criminal case. The bottom line is that if we were to enact the legislation, and if it were to be complied with, and prosecutions were brought by members of the Garda, we would criminalise youths on a regular basis in the Children's Court anyway. I fail to understand the argument that this Bill would criminalise large numbers of young people. If the provisions in the Children Act were implemented we would criminalise them anyway. There is now a provision that would provide for a yellow card system to the authorities. If there is a wayward offender, a person involved in serious forms of anti-social behaviour, the anti-social behaviour orders would be an effective system. It is important to differentiate between teenage pranks and serious continuing anti-social behaviour.I recently travelled to Britain to observe the implementation of anti-social behaviour orders and acceptable behaviour contracts on young people. From speaking to people on whom they had been served, and speaking to communities who have had to live with serious intimidation causing alarm and distress not just to a few people but to a whole community, I found that there has been a transformation of the community. In Ireland I see an opportunity to go a step further and ensure anti-social behaviour orders are served judiciously.Equally, if a person offends and an order is made, support services should be brought in immediately to assist that person. He or she may come from a dysfunctional background, in which there may be drug abuse, psychological problems or the myriad of other problems with which children grow up. We cannot allow them to continue on their way just because they grew up in a dysfunctional background or have behavioural problems. It is grossly unfair to the community but it is also neglect on the part of the State in turning a blind eye to a child experiencing problems. The anti-social behaviour orders or acceptable behaviour contracts give us an opportunity to bring that person into the system, to allow us to provide services and support.There may be problems with parenting. In Britain there is a parental order, where parents incapable of parenting are given skills, support and assistance. Very often parents are not capable of parenting because they may also be in a local authority housing estate without community support or the support of close family. That is something that needs to be examined.On the Children's Court, not all of the provisions of the Children Act have been enacted. We all accept that.

From what I can ascertain, in up to 30% to 40% of cases guardians or parents do not present themselves with the accused in court. That is a gross neglect under the Children Act because we need to ensure there is a parent or guardian at the hearing when a juvenile is tried. That is a failing of some magnitude. We want to ensure that we have some parental or guardianship responsibility yet no-one attends with juveniles in court. That must be addressed to ensure some degree of responsibility is placed on somebody else, rather than solely on the offender, who is criminalised in the Children's Court.Too often the Children's Court has not been taken seriously, but it is part of the criminal justice system. A person convicted in the Children's Court has a criminal conviction. In opposing the anti-social behaviour orders and acceptable behaviour contracts people have highlighted the fact that breach of an order criminalises young people. In fact, the current legislation allows for arrests and children being brought before the Children's Court so the child is criminalised anyway.Community policing needs to be introduced in a forceful manner. We all reminisce about the old days when the local garda lived in the station and knew everybody in the area. There used to be a few more gardaí living in the area and they all knew members of the community. Unfortunately community policing is seen as the bridesmaid of policing, or to be politically correct, the best man of policing. We have to ensure that community policing becomes a central focus of the activities of the Garda Síochána. We should start at the top by having an Assistant Garda Commissioner, responsible for community policing. There should be a promotional structure from the junior ranks of the Garda Síochána. If a garda is interested in community policing and works with the community, he or she has to come back into the mainstream and show credentials in crime detection and legislative enforcement if he or she wants to progress. We are losing the experience of community police officers as they move into mainstream policing and progress through the ranks if they are capable. That is something that needs to be examined.Local authorities have a responsibility to design estates with amenities, facilities and green spaces at planning stage of a development process. There should not be alleyways leading into dark areas at the back of houses. Estates that are genuinely conducive to a good community environment should be built. For many years estates were built with no provision of amenities and the houses were badly designed. There were dark alleyways and a lack of proper infrastructure to give a proper ambiance to the community. The physical well-being of an estate has an effect on how people see their community and on whether people take pride in their community. Local authorities must be more proactive so that when applications come in they take these factors into account.For many years we have blamed social deprivation, unemployment and poverty. Coupled with badly-designed housing estates, it is a recipe for disaster and this has proven to be the case. We are now involved in regeneration, dismantling apartment blocks and rejuvenating areas. Some of the apartment blocks being built around our cities are destined to become ghetto developments because of bad planning and design. Local authorities have a role to play.In some areas the Garda Síochána regularly meet public representatives and community associations. This should be put on a more permanent footing. Members of the Garda Síochána should be very involved in their communities. They should attend schools, speak to young people, get involved in soccer, GAA and rugby clubs, and youth groups. In this way gardaí would be part and parcel of a community. Community is not just about driving up and down an estate in a Garda car or on a bicycle, or walking the beat. Gardaí must interact, and must be part of the fabric of the community. That is something not allowed by the transient nature of community policing, where a garda spends two or three years in an area and is just beginning to build up contacts when he or she is whisked off to mainstream policing.There is an element of despondency in how people view our criminal justice system. People think there will be a technical problem so that a case will be dismissed. In Cork there was an appeal against a conviction and the person was released. That is the system we have but it undermines confidence. I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill, which has given me the opportunity to speak on the issues of anti-social behaviour. I hope the Minister takes on board the views expressed regarding the provisions for fighting anti-social behaviour in the community.

Tréaslaím leis mar gheall air sin. Beidh suim ag lucht teangeolaíochta chomh maith ar an chaoi inar úsáid sé an Ghaeilge mar chum sé a lán briathra nua agus focal nua ar nós "cearta an indibhidiúla" agus mar sin, focail nach raibh in úsáid in am asheanathar nuair a bhí sé ag tabhairt a chabhair go hiomlán leis an Ghaeilge. I will use some of the time allocated to me to contribute to this Bill in English, in deference to those who are interested in this debate. I confess to a particular interest in speaking on this legislation. In 1969, when I was appointed as a lecturer in sociology and political science, one of my specialisms was the sociology of law and deviant behaviour. I lectured in that area for over 20 years. My contribution today is based on my experience as a member of the McBride commission, at the invitation of people such as my colleague, Deputy Costello, in the late 1970s.When we held public hearings in Dublin in preparation for the MacBride report, which investigated prisons, one of the finest witnesses that appeared before us was a retired chief school attendance officer for Dublin City. He made it clear that he could detect in school attendance patterns more than 80% of all those who would run into trouble later. At that time, there was no co-operation between the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. Early intervention should have been introduced at that stage along the lines of the proposals in the White Paper, Children in Trouble, published by the British Labour Government in the late 1970s. That was not a soft approach to crime, however.One of the problems in the current debate is that those of us interested in trying to understand the dynamics of what is taking place in communities are misrepresented as being, somehow or another, soft on crime. We are also portrayed as not being as concerned as others that the right of older, vulnerable people to live in peace and security is being disturbed by a small minority. Elderly people are entitled to Government action but it should be done on the basis of properly constructed strategies for having peaceful and orderly communities.Is it acceptable that with education welfare legislation in place, the Bill having been passed by the Oireachtas, there are only approximately 25% of the necessary educational welfare officers to deal with the matter? There are currently slightly more than 80 such officers, whereas one would need 330 to 350 such staff to deal with children in trouble. If the Government were serious about dealing with such children, it would ensure that the educational welfare service was properly staffed.A large number of measures aimed at dealing with deviant behaviour is available at any one time. Rather like a pyramid-shaped funnel, the scale of measures includes breaches of the law and warnings by the diversionary programme, which was known previously as the juvenile liaison service. In addition, people may be accused of an offence while others may receive notice of an offence. The procedures also include investigation, apprehension, detention, court and prison. After prison there is a high level of recidivism among young offenders. One must approach this problem by applying every one of the measures I have cited, thus removing as many people as possible from progressing to the next stage. There is nothing in this legislation, however, that examines what one might call the understanding of deviant, criminal behaviour in the community.One of the most popular books in the 1970s and 1980s was Deviance and Control by Professor Albert Cohen. The introduction contained the sentence, “We are far more interested in control than we are in understanding”. Unfortunately, there is not much evidence of understanding in what I have heard during this debate.I want to make a point that goes to the heart of the work of this Dáil, and I speak as a former Cabinet Minister. It is outrageous to introduce a Bill on Second Stage while planning to add new sections on Committee Stage. I agree with some of the eight or nine principles in the Bill, including steps to secure a crime scene. It is wrong, however, to announce that a further nine principles, encompassing the majority of sections, will be introduced on Committee Stage. This deprives Deputies of the opportunity to discuss the entire Bill on Second Stage. Effectively, therefore, the Bill before us is not what will be presented on Committee Stage. That is an outrageous and unacceptable legislative procedure.I would have given the Minister support for some sections of the Bill, and I have cited one such instance already. In any other legislature, the Government would withdraw the Bill and announce that it was inserting nine new sections. A new Second Stage would then allow Deputies to participate in the debate, but that is not happening. It is outrageous and arrogant of the Government to act in this manner.I read the Minister's speech in Irish carefully and found this unusual phrase, "cearta indibhidiúla", which happens to be wrong. The European Convention on Human Rights refers to "personal rights". I will not go into the pedantic issues, but in Irish they are referred to as "cearta pearsanta". That does not matter, however, because translation on a good day is better than no Irish at all.I was a member of the Cabinet that introduced the Criminal Justice Act 1994. I have been concerned that we did not insert sufficient safeguards and accountability mechanisms in that fundamental piece of legislation that is now being reviewed here. I have known many wonderful and conscientious gardaí who have been proud to wear the uniform of the Garda Síochána. Such gardaí have not been well served by the antiquarian notions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I will cite an example to demonstrate my point. In the 1970s, when I was lecturing in sociology, young army cadets attended courses in sociology and other subjects. The same offer was made to the Garda Commissioner at that time, but it was decided that such courses would distract gardaí from real policing. Therefore, they did not take up the opportunity of pursuing our university course. Gardaí who graduated with degrees, often after pursuing evening courses in their own time, were not regarded as real policemen and suffered for it in the Garda Síochána promotional system.That kind of attitude existed in the Department of Justice also. I recall that we tried to establish an institute of criminology. Out of respect for the people in the Department of Justice, we were told that they would not be allowed to attend the meetings to establish such an institute. That kind of antediluvian attitude is still present in the minds of those who are not really committed to the question of internationally tested rights.I was upset to hear the current Minister say that he regards the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' process for dealing with immigrants as an encumbrance. He describes those of us who are interested in international human rights as people who are suffering from political correctness. The law is the law, however. I am in favour of the application of the criminal law with all its accountabilities, processes and certainties. If people are breaking the criminal law then let them be prosecuted to protect citizens. That principle of jurisprudence was established in the 18th century. Sadly, however, there are sections of this Bill for which there is not a shred of jurisprudence. Section 29, for example, is an outrage. It is badly worded and is a major breach of basic legal protections. It does not strike a balance between victims of crime and those who perpetrate it. The absence of process is outrageous. I listened with interest to a thoughtful speech by Deputy McGuinness. Deputy Kelleher then said the Children Act 2001 and its provisions were part of the criminal process. They are the very opposite. Regarding the thinking of children in trouble, the thrust of the Children Act 2001 was to remove from criminalisation and stigmatisation as many children as possible through early intervention. It is interesting that the juvenile liaison service was replaced by the diversionary service. Let us be positive with regard to some matters. Where the diversionary service is used and resourced, 90% of the youngsters it deals with do not offend again before the age of 18. Why not take that as our example? If three sections of the Children Act are being implemented, why not implement the other seven proposals among the ten fundamental proposals which would keep children off the conveyor belt of criminalisation?It is disgraceful that people would rush to these punitive sanctions without a shred of evidence. It was suggested that it is somehow or other justified because of the victims of crime. If we get a chance when Members are replying on Second Stage, let us see the sections dealing with the victims of crime. There are few references in this Bill to doing anything for victims of crime. This is a rather cheap attempt to exploit the politics of fear.Some of us have spent much of our lives working in this area. Nine principal matters in the Bill were announced on Second Stage. We have had an announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of nine fundamental amendments for Committee Stage. Reference has been made to what have been referred to as anti-social behaviour orders. The Minister has made most of these announcements through the media and not in this House. How can we have Committee Stage of a Bill when we have not had a Second Stage discussion on it? Let the Minister come to the House to make his statements.I am worried about the Minister's statements on these issues. He is not taking into account some of the research regarding where ASBOs are applied, and said he did not have a single objection to their introduction from a Member or anyone else representing a working class constituency. I represent more working class people than the Minister ever will, and I have done so for a long time. I live in an area surrounded by housing estates and I know what I am talking about.I regret that we did not put more safeguards in the Criminal Justice Bill 1994, because I have seen it abused. I saw an interesting situation in that regard, involving two people, not from Galway. One, a boy, was standing in front of Jury's Hotel. He was waiting for his sister when a garda told him to move on. After a quarter of an hour the boy's sister had not arrived and he was still there. He had a bottle but was not drunk. He was dragged into the Garda station. His sister was unable to find him, and he was missing for several hours. In court, the judge asked if the boy had given cheek to the garda, and the garda said he had.That sort of abuse of the law is not unusual. When the Minister, Deputy McDowell, attends this House to tell us he has established an independent authority which will give us the policing which the police, the community, the public and ourselves want, when we can have legislation which will be tested by independent scrutiny, he can then lecture us. Instead, he is afraid to attend the House with his nine proposals. How is he to define, for example, anti-social behaviour?A colleague who has worked all her life for the debt and development commission was collecting signatures for the campaign to abolish Third World debt. She was dragged off in a police van from the streets of Galway city, where we struggled for the right to be able to distribute literature and to assemble in a public place. While distributing her literature, she was told she was in breach of a by-law. I advised her she was not. She was then told she was in breach of the Public Order Act and brought to the police station. She has never received an apology.Such extraordinary behaviour is all justified on the basis of whipping up fear and blaggarding people who hold views like mine, suggesting we are soft on crime. We understand crime. We have visited prisons and dealt with those who have committed crime. I have visited more prisons than Deputy McDowell. I was a member of the McBride commission many years ago. I can tell of the hypocrisy of the reforms with regard to what is being published today. Around the same time as I was on the McBride commission, Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain presented his report about video-recording in police stations. If its recommendations were implemented even on a pilot basis, nearly 30 years ago, one would not have had the situation we have seen in Donegal regarding the McBrearty case.Let us have reform of the criminal law, but not an hysterical public campaign on some kind of alleged moral entrepreneurship, with the Minister cowardly going on his little moral crusade outside the Dáil, lacking the courage to attend the House and justify the extremism.Sections of this Bill are good, while others, such as sections 15 and 29, should be deleted. If the Minister goes down the road he is on with regard to dealing with behaviour which is tearing the heart out of many communities, he must implement and resource the relevant sections of the Children Act. The educational welfare offices must be adequately staffed in accordance with the legislation.What will happen regarding an ordinary public protest one might have? For example, I support the right of the Palestinian people to a state. I do not justify any extreme actions and have always condemned them. However, people organising protests in Dublin on behalf of the Palestinian people are being made jump through hoops with regard to satisfying the corporation, and can be asked for an insurance bond of up to more than €600,000. People might want to put on a street theatre show involving the demolition of a house, as happens in the West Bank and the occupied territories, but the Garda authorities will tell them that is an incitement to hatred.What will happen when a person is asked by a garda for his or her name and address, and that person asks for proof of identity, and then refuses to accept it? The person is asked to come to the Garda station. One could be holding up a banner, just as some of us have been doing all our lives, and refuse to go to the station. One is then fined €1,500. If that is not paid, one is then involved in the criminal process.This is a republic, with rights, including the right to be in a public space, the right to law and protection and the right of communities to live in peace. We must not be bludgeoned into a strange system whereby anyone who feels like it can get an ASBO against a neighbour. People are crowing about ASBOs in Britain. A recent television programme revealed that ASBOs have been taken out there against old-age pensioners. There were two old men living alongside another old man. One was up in the attic, recording the neighbour's singing. The other man complained of a television being turned up too loud, which was only because the person watching the television was deaf. Those people got ASBOs against each other. Local authorities in Britain have found that the ASBO system is not working. The diversionary programme which replaced the juvenile liaison service is working.I will tell another story of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and of its penny-pinching. Typically, a garda would visit a house to talk to a youngster in trouble and to the parents. Quite often, that was enough. Now, people in such situations are told to attend the Garda station in order to save money and overtime.We need intervention systems for children in trouble, community policing and good law. We need to have intervention orders which will work. We do not need a hysterical public debate, whipped up for the sole purpose of exploiting the politics of fear, which drives a coach and four through our criminal law. Most of all, this House must be respected. Second Stage speeches are for the fundamentals of the legislation and one cannot make a Second Stage speech on Committee Stage.

Suicide is a serious social problem in our country. In 2003, the number of registered deaths in Ireland attributed to suicide was 444. This high incidence of suicide in the population is not confined to Ireland but is a growing global problem. A disturbing feature is the male suicide rate which accounted for 80% of deaths from suicide in 2003. In particular, young males and older males aged 65 years and over have shown an increase in the rate of suicide. These are trends which require further research so that strategies can be developed to help people who are particularly at risk.As the suicide figures began to increase back in the early 1990s, my Department became aware of the need for reliable and concrete information on which to build a national strategy to address the problem of suicide in Ireland. The national task force on suicide was therefore established in 1995 to address the growing prevalence of suicide in our society. The task force comprised 15 individuals from a range of backgrounds, including the coroner service, the Garda Síochána, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health and many voluntary organisations.In September 1996, the task force published its interim report. It contained a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland and a preliminary analysis into the factors that could be associated with suicidal behaviour. The task force's final report was published in January 1998 and marked the completion of detailed examination of the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide and outlined a comprehensive strategy to reduce these in Ireland. The report outlined 86 areas where interventions should be targeted to reduce suicide levels. This highlights the complexity of the issue of suicide prevention. There are no simple solutions. The report also identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.While the level of suicide among our young people continues to give cause for concern, it is important to point out that youth suicide in Ireland is not the highest in the European Union. The most recent analysis suggests it is fifth highest. In terms of the overall suicide rate, Ireland ranks 17th in the European Union. Recent figures suggest that the rate has stopped rising, but it is correct that we probably experienced the fastest rising rate in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s, albeit from a low base rate.The key components of the overall strategy recommended by the national task force in 1998 included the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups, provision of information, training on suicide prevention for relevant professionals and organisations and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide. Since the publication of the report of the national task force, there has been a positive and committed response among both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling this tragic problem.Significant progress has been made in a number of different areas, including the appointment of a suicide resource officer in each Health Service Executive area; the establishment of the national suicide review group, the National Suicide Research Foundation and the national parasuicide registry; the appointment of liaison psychiatric nurses to accident and emergency departments in many general hospitals; the provision of training for relevant health care personnel with regard to suicidal behaviour — this training is ongoing in all Health Service Executive regions; the enactment of legislation restricting the availability of medications which can be used to overdose; the development of a social and personal health education, SPHE, programme which is now compulsory for all junior cycle students in secondary schools; the publication of a directory of services in each Health Service Executive area for those who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour; and the development of a new form 104, which is the form on which the Central Statistics Office figures are based. A Garda inspector within each division has been nominated to oversee the use and completion of the form.These are just some examples of the progress which has been made to date. Much more detail about various initiatives under way throughout the country can be found in the annual reports of the national suicide review group which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year. Many of the recommendations of the task force require continual development, particularly in the area of training and in the enhancement of our mental health services.The Health Service Executive, in particular, has a major role to play in co-ordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and attempted suicide. Resource officers have been appointed in all the health service regions with specific responsibility for implementing the task force's recommendations. Their responsibilities include the provision of staff training in risk assessment, production of information literature and events aimed at raising public awareness of suicide and parasuicide.Another important aspect of suicide prevention has been the establishment of the national suicide review group. Membership of this group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. Its main responsibilities are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations. The group's researchers also collate existing research materials, both national and international, examine the effectiveness of intervention programmes and liaise with local co-ordinators.Ongoing strategies and prevention programmes throughout the country are regularly reviewed by the national suicide review group and routinely commented on in its annual report. This report meets the requirement of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 which provides that the Minister for Health and Children will make a report each year to each House of the Oireachtas on the measures taken by health boards in the preceding year to address the problem of suicide.The Department also allocates funding through the NSRG to voluntary and statutory groups engaged in prevention initiatives, many of which are aimed at improving the mental health of the younger age groups. These projects include life- skills courses for high-risk youth, school-based personal development modules and mental health promotion campaigns. A number of the projects have been positively evaluated and have been proven to enhance the coping skills of the participants. It is anticipated that such campaigns will lead to a reduction in youth suicidal behaviour over time.The health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, included a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes. I am pleased to report that work is well under way on the preparation of a national strategy for action on suicide prevention. The strategy, which is being prepared by the project management unit of the Health Service Executive in partnership with the national suicide review group, is supported by the Department of Health and Children. Work on the development of the strategy was initiated almost two years ago. Almost 700 people have attended regional and national consultation meetings since then and submissions have been sought in the national press. A national and international expert group of 16 people reviewed the strategy during the last two weeks of April and their analysis is being incorporated in the strategy.The national strategy for action on suicide prevention that will emerge from the consultation process will take account of the input of external reviewers and the dedicated writing team. It will be of a high quality, it will focus on action and it will be based on evidence. It will highlight some actions which should be of immediate priority. The strategy will set targets for implementation over the next five years, as well as long-term objectives for suicide prevention and mental health promotion. I have met Dr. Rosaleen Corcoran, who is leading this process, on a number of occasions. I am pleased to inform the House that the strategy will be published in September of this year.The national strategy's fundamental aims will be to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm, and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population. The strategy will emphasise the need for ongoing multidisciplinary research of a high quality. Research findings are of greatest value when they inform and stimulate action and service development. The strategy will identify expected outcomes and set targets which can be measured, monitored and revised. Continuous quality control and ongoing modification and improvement will be central to the implementation of the strategy.Deputies may be aware that the President, Mrs. Mary McAleese, recently hosted a forum in Áras an Uachtaráin for groups and stakeholders working on suicide prevention. The theme for the gathering was integration and partnership, in acknowledgement of the increasing fragmentation in the suicide prevention field and the need for leadership and coherence at national level. Such issues will be addressed in the context of the new national strategy. A document that summarises the discussion at Áras an Uachtaráin, Suicide in Ireland — Everybody's Problem, was launched earlier this week. It was compiled by Dr. Tony Bates, who acted as rapporteur at the event. The theme of the report, as its title suggests, is that co-operation and involvement across the entire community is required if we are to reduce suicidal behaviour. The President has expressed her interest in continuing to support efforts in this regard. I welcome her involvement.If we are to reduce the number of suicides, it is essential that people with life crises get appropriate support. In that context, expenditure on suicide prevention programmes has increased significantly in recent years. The Department of Health and Children has given special attention to the resourcing of suicide prevention initiatives in the last few years. The level of funding provided by the Department of Health and Children for suicide prevention is more than 20 times greater than it was in 1999. Since the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, more than €17.5 million has been provided for suicide prevention and research aimed at improving understanding of the issue. That figure does not include funding provided by other Departments, including the Departments of Education and Science, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which were identified in the National Task Force on Suicide's report as having a role to play in suicide prevention.Additional funding has been given to the National Suicide Research Foundation, a multidisciplinary research centre that informs health service developments and policy formulation. The foundation, which was established in January 1995 by the late Dr. Michael Kelleher, consists of a multidisciplinary research team of professionals from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry and sociology. The primary aims of the foundation are to define the true extent of the problem of suicidal behaviour in Ireland, to identify and measure the factors which induce and protect against suicidal behaviour and to develop strategies aimed at preventing such behaviour.To date, most of the National Suicide Research Foundation's work has involved the monitoring of parasuicide. Annualised data on every suicide and undetermined death registered in Ireland is sent to the foundation by the Central Statistics Office. The statistics are analysed to produce up-to-date age-specific and age-standardised suicide rates, with respect to demographic variables. Such information about suicide is provided in response to the numerous requests the foundation receives from professional bodies, students and the public.The promotion of high levels of self-esteem and self-confidence among young people will take place as an important aspect of the suicide prevention programme. We need to ensure that such people develop personal and social skills. I welcome the debate on this issue. It is important for public representatives to discuss mental health issues and the incidence of suicide. That people are aware of the problems which exist is a sign of the wonderful advances which have taken place in our country. I compliment the many voluntary organisations throughout the country — I will not name them because there are so many of them — which contribute enormously to the positive mental health scene.I was present in the Seanad for its recent comprehensive and constructive three-hour debate on mental health and suicide. I look forward to the contributions of my Dáil colleagues during this debate. It is healthy to discuss this matter, especially as the stigma and taboo which attached to suicide prevented people from talking about it in the past. If we work together to prevent suicide and promote positive mental health, we will make a greater collective contribution to ensuring that suicide levels stop increasing, as they have already done. When the expert group publishes the national strategy later this year, I hope it recommends measures which will ensure the levels of suicide decrease. There is a need for much more recognition of the importance of positive mental health in the community.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important subject. I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing readily to the request made by the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, for a debate on suicide during Government time. I hope it heralds a new and inclusive era of political debate and consensus and, more importantly, leads to positive action to stem the tide of the loss of so many lives, many of them young, in Ireland.I convey my sympathy to the many people who have been bereaved by suicide. The families, friends and communities of those who are tragically visited by suicide have to endure a great deal of trauma. We should recognise the uniqueness of the bereavement suffered by such people.The issue of suicide should unite the House, rather than divide it. No single party or person has a monopoly on concern or sympathy. Action must be taken by the Government because it controls the purse strings. Action costs money, but the cost of the loss of many lives is incalculable. Suicide, which is a compelling and personal tragedy, is a terrible, bleak and lonely end to a human life. It leaves family and friends bereaved, grieving, confused and bewildered. Every suicide leaves behind pain, desolation, outrage and unanswered questions. For many years, many of us seldom gave suicide a second thought. We may have had the illusion that it was something that happened to others and not to us. The increasing incidence of this tragedy now means that we are becoming all too familiar with the incidences of suicide in our families, among our friends and in our communities. I deeply regret such familiarity while welcoming the increased public debate. We must bring this issue out of the shadows and begin to take responsibility.We must never forget that suicide is a terrible act against nature and must not be considered as a solution to any problem in any circumstances. Suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility. The tide can only be turned by concerted and co-ordinated actions by all sections of society. This is why this debate is so important. We in this House are all charged with the development of public policy and services. This is where action on a national level can and must begin. I understand the reluctance of some commentators and reporters to accept that suicide is a political as well as a personal issue. Many believe that politicians should not play a role in addressing what is a crucial social and health issue. Concern has been expressed that political debate on the subject may upset the bereaved relatives of suicide victims whose pain is characterised by agonised questioning and a search for some explanation of what happened. One of the problems with suicide is that we do not want to talk about a subject that has been taboo for so long.International research has shown that between 80% and 90% of those who take their lives suffer from a psychiatric or emotional condition and, in many cases, this is unidentified depression. Recent research carried out in Kildare indicated that most of the young men who died had suffered from undiagnosed depression. The development of the psychiatric services has a key role in reducing suicide and in suicide prevention. The debate on the development of the psychiatric services is similar to the debate on suicide prevention.I have repeatedly suggested to the Minister of State that there is an absolute need to invest heavily in the development of the psychiatric services, not just to prevent suicide but to deal with the issue of mental health. One in four people will at some stage suffer from a psychiatric health condition which will need intervention. We do not have community-based psychiatric services, which are needed. In 1997, 11% of the health budget went towards the psychiatric services. This year that budget is at just 7%. In England and Wales it is at 14%. Scotland has recognised it as a special difficulty, and 18% of its total health budget has been invested in the development of the psychiatric services.The Minister of State said that €17 million has been spent on suicide prevention since 1997, which amounts to approximately €2 million a year. Surely this is unacceptable in the context of the total spending of the Government and the Department. I just attended a committee meeting dealing with the issue of the Travers report on which €1 billion or €2 billion will be spent, yet we are talking about just €2 million a year to deal with suicide prevention. It is totally inadequate. The Minister of State referred to €90 million for the development of the psychiatric services. The budget for this service is totally inadequate and indicates the Government's lack of interest in the area. It is worthwhile repeating these facts.This time each year, I table a Dáil question on the amount of money spent on suicide prevention and I am informed by way of letter. In early April this year, I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children what moneys were being spent on suicide prevention this year. She could not answer me because her Department did not know the answer. The query was referred to the Health Service Executive and I am still awaiting the information. In other years it took four days to receive a reply but after the Health Service Executive was set up, the Minister has no responsibility in this regard and, after waiting for two months, I still have not received the information. This is not fair to those of us who work in the area.Most people who die by suicide do not want to die; they want to remove the pain rather than die. Suicide is not a diagnosis, it is a behaviour. Suicide has puzzled people down through the years. Parents, families and professionals are puzzled as to why it happens but there appears to be no answer. There is need for research to find out why it is happening. Some research is taking place but we must find out why suicide is happening. There are not sufficient psychological autopsies being carried out. How can we learn if more psychological autopsies are not carried out to get more information on people who take their lives?The most difficult thing to accept when someone takes his or her life is that no one is to blame and that it is impossible, no matter what is done, to prevent all suicides. The acceptance of this may be the most difficult of all. It is inevitable that all parties, including schools, mental health professionals and families will feel guilt when a person commits suicide. It is also inevitable that all parties will try to shift the blame to others. The purpose of the blame is to remove personal guilt. It is also denying the fact that no one is to blame when a suicide takes place.I want to deal with the area of gender and suicide. There is a contradiction in that male suicide and hopelessness has increased while Ireland has a booming economy. I have dealt with the medical side but this is the societal side of suicide. Professor Michael Fitzgerald, Chairman of the Irish Association of Suicidology, said that in Irish society in 2005, males find it harder to find a role and identity in society. Young males are often lost. If unemployed, they are unsuccessful. They feel discarded and there is an increased likelihood that they will consider suicide. They tend to use the strategy of the stiff upper lip. In some ways, females rearing children has not changed over the years, but the massive increase in working outside the home has changed for females. Nevertheless, in agricultural communities, women always worked on the farm, therefore, the new change in work practices may not be as radical as is often perceived. The institutions in which we put our faith, such as the Church, State agencies, the Garda and politicians have lost face in recent years and lost the trust of people to a greater or lesser extent. As these institutions have been declining in stature, the rate of suicide has been increasing. The people in Ireland who are valued in 2005 are males who are successful, who are winners, who are attending third level education and earning big bucks. People who are not in this category find it very difficult to find an identity, a position in which to earn respect, support or a place in society. Ireland is a place for winners. If one is not in that category, there is no place for one in current society.The critical issue for male adolescents is to derive an identity, self-esteem and personal meaning from their position in society. People who are not winning are marginalised and devalued by society. There is no place for them. Those who fall out of education are the most vulnerable. All the studies that have been carried out, especially those carried out by the late Michael Kelleher, indicate that there is a higher level of suicide among people who leave education early. In the past, young Irish males could have gone to church, identified with God and the idea that there is something else beyond the euro. Nowadays there is nowhere for them to turn. There is also fragmentation of the family. There is an increase in marriage breakdown and the number of separations since 1986 has more than doubled. There is a fundamental breakdown in relationships between people and their socio-cultural setting. We do not know what our true value is. We have lost our way. The euro is worshipped and happiness emanates from the euro. We are told a private car is all we need. Many males are marooned, disconnected, alienated and lost. There is a lack of integration of the individual in society and there is a lack of solidarity among people, which solidarity came from attending mass with the same people in the same church every week. The religious festivals of the past are no more and they have been replaced by drinking festivals.It is vital that the role of alcohol in suicide should be examined. Dr. John Connolly, secretary of the Irish Association of Suicidology, has done a great deal of good work in this area. There is a high incidence of suicide among alcoholics but suicide also occurs when people consume alcohol during crises, which interferes with their objectivity. The inhibitions of those contemplating suicide are also reduced.The Minister of State referred to the national task force on suicide, which reported in 1998, and he highlighted that eight of its 86 recommendations have been implemented, which speaks for itself. The national suicide review group published its first report in 1999 and one of its chief objectives was to implement the recommendations of the task force, although it was the Department's responsibility. The review group was set up for that purpose but only eight of the recommendations have been implemented. A strategy group was established recently. Is the wheel being reinvented? Can the Minister of State not implement the remaining recommendations of the task force?

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Department and the Government have failed to implement them. I have met psychiatrists who say nothing can be done about suicide. In the mid-1990s Australia identified young male suicide as a serious issue and the Government there introduced expensive measures to combat suicide. As a result, the incidence of suicide has reduced by 24% and the lowest incidence occurs in males aged between 15 and 20.Suicide results in a cost to the State. That may be considered insensitive but every suicide costs the State. I refer to international calculations of the cost. A successful suicide strategy will generate significant economic benefits above and beyond the cost of a suicide. Three distinct economic factors are associated with suicide — the loss of production as a result of a suicide, the potential future contribution to the economy of the person who dies and the human cost the individuals place on their lives. If this international calculation is applied to the most recent suicide statistics in Ireland, which were published in 2003, the cost to the State was approximately €800 million. A calculation can also be made regarding the cost of deliberate self-harm, which is estimated at approximately €40 million annually. While this may be crude and insensitive, money is needed to address the incidence of suicide.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	121	It is unusual to revisit an issue so soon after it has been debated in Private Members' time but the issue of suicide deserves to be revisited. As Deputy Neville has stated on a number of occasions, suicide is a unique tragedy which has a lifelong impact on families and communities. The proliferation of support groups in recent years has helped families to cope with suicides and I hope the Government will bring about a small and modest improvement in this regard by encouraging and facilitating such groups. Families should always be focused on in debates on suicide as well as the tragic victims.The House debated the issue of suicide shortly after the County Offaly coroner had described the incidence of suicide in his area as an epidemic. That was a shocking statement by somebody who is aware of the incidence of suicide in his community and it should be a wake-up call for those who doubt the seriousness of the problem.Suicide is related to mental health and mental health services have been neglected. An increasing number of young suicide victims has focused long overdue attention on this problem. While advances have been made in recognising suicide as a major public health and social issue, suicide and mental health services in general have suffered sustained neglect in funding by the Government. For example, the slashing of the mental health budget to 6.9% of the overall health budget from 11% in 1997, despite the increased incidence of suicide annually, indicates the Government does not have its priorities right. Only 20 inpatient beds with specialised services for adolescents with mental health problems are in place, despite a Government commissioned report which recommended in 2000 that at least 120 of these beds were needed and should be provided.The increasing incidence of suicide both internationally and in Ireland is a major public health problem, particularly among young men. The suicide rate among this group has increased fourfold since 1990 making it the most common cause of death among young people. The latest statistics reveal that suicide accounts for 50% more deaths annually than road accidents. Deaths resulting from overdoses or from lethal cocktails of drugs are sometimes not fully understood in terms of whether they were deliberate or accidental. I suspect the incidence of suicide is higher than official statistics record.Suicide is the most common cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds and the rate in Ireland is increasing more quickly than in other countries. The incidence of suicide among young females has doubled since 1992. Young males comprise a particularly vulnerable group and a strategy must assess and target what can be done to facilitate them to deal with the pressures they face.Parasuicide is also an issue. Significant numbers of parasuicides enter the health system and then disappear and this needs to be addressed. In 2003, 11,200 parasuicides presented at hospital accident and emergency departments and they must be tracked more effectively. We must ensure that supports come into play when someone presents as a parasuicide case. Otherwise, the likelihood is that some of these people will successfully kill themselves at some point in the future. There is a correlation between suicide and factors such as unemployment, poverty, bullying, relationship break-ups, legal and work related problems, alcohol and drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse in childhood and social exclusion. These are parts of the conditions that lead to suicide and must be addressed.No debate on suicide can ignore mental health issues due to the correlation between suicide and mental illnesses, particularly depression. Emotional and mental distress can be as debilitating and life-threatening as physical illness at times. However, psychiatric illness does not receive the attention, investment and resources that go towards treating physical illness. It is time to change this mind set. Despite the passing into law of the long overdue Mental Health Act 2001, mental health remains the Cinderella of Ireland's health services as it has been receiving a smaller and smaller share of a cake that is not big enough to begin with. The area is under funded, unequally distributed, understaffed and lacking in essential specialist services. In short, it is as neglected and ignored as many of its clients. The most recent media coverage highlights the mental health tribunals we are still awaiting. The staffing requirement there is an indication of the Government's views on this whole issue.We have had report after report that has highlighted the neglect and pointed out that the most deprived areas in the country receive the smallest mental health allocations. They have shown that the mentally ill in Ireland are still stigmatised and forgotten. They have also pointed out that despite the proliferation of previous reports and many commitments, we still do not have properly resourced community care for our mentally ill, properly constituted clinical teams to deal with those most vulnerable people and we do not have enough beds for certain specialties, notably child and adolescent, forensic services and services for eating disorders. At the same time, our system remains far too bed-based, with valuable resources tied up in bed provision rather than community-based services such as day hospitals, day centres, hospitals, half way houses, drop in centres and properly staffed community and mental health teams.I take this opportunity to digress. My local hospital is St. Colmcille's in Loughlinstown, County Dublin, and it has the only centre in the country dealing with eating disorders. It was very disturbing to discover that 12 people died while waiting for treatment at that centre because it is simply incapable of meeting the huge growing need relating to obesity. Making this point is important even if it is not germane to this debate. We do not have enough psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, therapists, nurses and back up staff. We do not intervene early enough to make a real difference for those who develop serious mental illnesses. We do not have an even near-adequate mental health service in place to deal with the one in four of us who will experience significant mental health difficulties in our lifetime.The World Health Organisation sets out general principles for mental health legislation to protect the rights of the mentally ill, including respect for individuals and their social, cultural, ethnic or religious and philosophical values, taking into account individual needs, care and treatment provided in the least restrictive environment and a provision of care and treatment aimed at promoting each individual's self-determination and personal responsibility. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by Ireland, states that all persons have the right to the best available mental health care. In the Irish Celtic tiger economy of 2005, we are a long way from honouring our commitment under this convention and it is time we started to do so. These principles centring on the ideas of individual autonomy and respect have influenced new thinking about psychiatric illness. The ambition is now based on working out a road to recovery in partnership between the patient and the professionals rather than viewing recovery as something that is dispensed by one person to a compliant patient. This partnership is an important change but there are not enough staff to provide that type of secure support for people, which is something with which we must concern ourselves.I made a point during Private Members' time that there are many societal influences on the suicide rate. Everyone agrees that, in countries experiencing rapid rates of change, levels of suicide have increased. No country has experienced as much change as Ireland over the past decades. However, it would be wrong and somewhat superficial to ignore the other feature that pertains to the influences of society on the well-being and good health of its population. Countries with the greatest inequalities are those with the greatest levels of ill health. A fair society is a healthier society. We depend to some extent on British data but what we are seeing is the increasing inequality leading to greater ill health and higher levels of suicide. We should take this information on board as politicians, not just as a matter of health policy but as a matter of our basic political perspective. If we continue to develop a society that is so unequal and is now second to the US in terms of inequality between the better off and the poor, we are not creating a better society. We are creating an unfair society where more and more people are being left behind. As Deputy Neville pointed out, the hopelessness and loss of self-esteem is considerable in a society where achievement is seen as central to individual well being.In terms of analysing data on socio-economic classes, there is a whole cohort of people that is not known about. Such people do not fit into the modern categories of class and it is in this growing group of people that increasing numbers are committing suicide. This must not only be an issue of concern but of political initiative to ensure we develop a fair society in a way that will have an important impact on health and sense of well being. We will thereby ensure a reduction in suicide levels.Currently our resources are often located in the areas that need them least when it comes to mental health services. We are all indebted to the Irish Psychiatric Association, which performed a magnificent job in producing its report The Stark Facts, which showed the extraordinary imbalance between affluent and better resourced mental health services and areas of deprivation, where not only were resources unavailable but where consultant psychiatrists or senior professionals were in temporary positions. This leads to instability in terms of treatment. That type of inequity is heaped upon a society already based on inequity. The two tiered nature of our health service is a reflection of the greater inequity that exists in our health service across the board. We are unique in Europe in our extraordinarily different approach, whereby someone with insurance can access care very rapidly but an uninsured person who is in need cannot. We need a new initiative in mental health services to ensure that equity exists and that in the areas of greatest need, the greatest effort is made to provide resources and facilities.It is important to assess the potential impact of policy changes or legislation on the possibility of more young people committing suicide. I have grave concerns about the proposal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to deregulate the public house licensing system and to develop café bars. Dr. Joe Barry, president of the Irish Medical Organisation, has expressed strong and critical opposition to these measures and we should listen to him. If we do not deal with the binge drinking culture and alcohol abuse there will be no possibility of achieving a reduction in our suicide levels. If we do not wake up to that fact, we will be back in this House in one, five or ten years' time making the same points and facing worsened statistics and higher numbers of people committing suicide with the terrible, tragic loss of life that entails.

Suicide is a major issue which affects all strata of society, irrespective of class. It particularly affects young males, among whom the rate of suicide is very high.Suicide was a taboo subject at one time that was not discussed openly in any forum. Now, however, people are not afraid to use the word "suicide" and to call it what it is. People have seen that it is a tragedy and are prepared to speak openly about it. This has been evident at various seminars, one of which was held at Dromahair in County Leitrim. There was a large attendance at that event which was due to finish at 5 p.m. but continued until 7 p.m. In County Monaghan the vocational education committee and the Health Service Executive joined forces to host seminars at the Hillgrove Hotel in Monaghan town and the Nuremore Hotel, Carrickmacross. Both seminars were well attended with a high level of audience participation. People were looking for answers and action to be taken. People are afraid, particularly those who have lost loved ones or who fear that they might lose them.In the context of possible solutions, a German model was put forward. A prevention programme was piloted in Nürnberg over a two-year period which resulted in a 26% reduction in suicide and self-harm. In Würzberg, where the programme was not piloted, there was a 24% increase in suicide and self-harm in the same period. The German programme will be piloted in Cork and Kerry and consists of four strands: liaising with general practitioners and organising GP workshops; targeting people who have engaged in self-harm, as it has been shown that such people are at a greater risk of committing suicide; targeting key professionals such as social workers and priests; and targeting the media, running advertising campaigns in cinemas and so forth.If that pilot programme worked in Germany, there is no reason we should pilot it again to determine if it works here. I urge the Government to expand the scheme on an all-Ireland basis. It will save lives, is sensible and contains nothing harmful. The current situation is that we are adopting the German models and re-testing them to see if they are worthy of their reputation. I call on the Government to implement the prevention programme nationally.References have been made to budgets. There must be some form of direct correlation between the reduction in the mental health budget and the increase in suicide. The mental health budget has decreased from 11% to 7% of total health spending, which is reflected in the level of resources locally. There are simply not enough resources to meet demand and money should be invested in the pilot project to which I have referred.In every case of suicide, a full audit should be performed. All the circumstances of the case should be examined. We must determine if the person was in contact with the mental health services, whether the services responded, how well and whether they failed the individual. We also need to ask if the person confided in a friend or loved one and, if so, whether the confidant was equipped to deal with the situation.Sometimes people do not know where to go for help. If one rings the Department of Health and Children, the response one receives is not good. I would like to think that the quality of response would improve. We also need to examine whether there was a trigger factor in the suicide, whether there were clusters of suicides in an area and the age profile of the deceased. If we get a better and fuller understanding of suicide and those most likely to take their lives, we will have a better quality of response and will be better equipped to deal with the problem.We should review suicide figures monthly because this will make it more likely that someone will have to answer questions. Annual reviews are inadequate. It is 2005 and we are analysing the suicide figures for 2003. That is not good enough. Another issue is bed shortages. I called for media coverage of this debate, not to name people but to keep the issue alive.

This issue must be dealt with in a well thought-out, caring and professional manner. We must face up to the problem in our society and move on to resolve it.The Government and the broader community must accept that suicide is a major crisis in the State. We must face that reality and accept that the latest statistics reveal that suicide accounts for 50% more deaths annually than road traffic accidents. A total of 444 people committed suicide last year while 293 people died on the roads. Suicide is the most common cause of death in Ireland among those aged between 15 and 24 and our rate in this age group is the highest of all 25 EU states. The suicide rate in Ireland is rising more quickly than in any other EU country and the rate among young females doubled between 1992 and 2000. The highest rate of suicide in the past five years is among men aged between 20 and 29. In 2003, 11,200 para-suicides or attempted suicides presented to hospital accident and emergency departments.There is a correlation between suicide and factors such as unemployment, living in poverty, bullying, relationship breakdown, legal and work related problems, alcohol and drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse in childhood and social exclusion. We have witnessed the slashing of the mental health budget from 11% of the total health budget in 1997 to 6.8% this year, despite the fact that suicide is claiming more lives annually. Another reality that must be faced is that there are only 20 inpatient beds with specialised services for adolescents with mental health problems.This is the reality for many of our citizens. However, suicide is also a community and family issue. We must all slow down and listen to the needs and feelings of others. The modern society of rush and go, competition and pressure leads to a situation where people are not listening to one another and vulnerable people fall through the net. Every citizen of this State should be the eyes and ears of a public health strategy. We must become a community that listens.I have a number of proposals to deal with suicide, including developing an effective strategic action plan for both prevention and reduction of suicide as an urgent, national priority; implementing all 86 recommendations of the 1998 report of the national task force on suicide on ways to prevent and reduce the incidence of suicide; establishing a national suicide prevention agency; providing a comprehensive programme of multidisciplinary research and investment in suicide prevention strategies; and improving awareness of suicide by investing resources in education programmes and mental health services. When the Government carries out such actions, then we can say we are taking the issue of suicide seriously. I urge all Deputies to reflect on these important matters.

There is little one can say in two and a half minutes except for every family that has been touched by suicide, words cannot express anything. One can only try to empathise with families affected by suicide because in many cases, people will blame themselves for the suicide of their loved ones. Unfortunately, there are practicalities that impinge on this personal tragedy. For example, the UK spends four times as much on mental health services as Ireland. There is a greater drink culture here than in continental Europe. These factors contribute to our high suicide rate.Deputy Neville, who made a very telling contribution, pointed out that the majority of suicides are caused by mental health problems. I agree with Deputy Neville's point but I would like to use the short time available to focus on alcohol and young people, an issue that is closer to my heart. In some instances, alcohol is a contributing factor in the suicides caused by psychiatric or mental health problems. In a study by the Samaritans in 2003, a number of adolescents who had contacted the Samaritans were asked how many times they had been drunk in the previous year. Those who had contacted the Samaritans reported being drunk ten times more than those who had not contacted the Samaritans, which is telling. Between 400 and 500 young people commit suicide every year in Ireland. This represents one in three of all deaths of those between the ages of 15 and 24. The figure could be higher because the incidence of single-car accidents among male drivers is disproportionately high and we do not know how many people take their lives in this context.We need to focus on alcohol and responsible drinking in this debate. Deputy McManus made a point regarding inequality, with which I concur.I would also like to address the issues of community and family values. As we have prospered, the values and the respect we had for each other, the environment around us and our family and community have disappeared. There must be some collective way that we, as politicians, can try to encourage the restoration of those values without returning to the era of the squinting windows.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Ireland has the second highest incidence of suicide in Europe. In 2003, 577 people took their own lives, the majority being young men. We need to look at the reasons behind this. What is the reason behind the rising suicide rate? I think there has been a 25% rise in suicides over the last ten years, particularly in young males. We need to examine the social deprivation and inequalities in our society if we are to find a remedy for this enormous tragedy that is inflicted on many families each year.Suicide touches the life of every Deputy numerous times each year when their constituents endure the pain of suicide. The enormous pressures facing young people, particularly within the education system, are a major contributing factor in suicides. We grade children like cattle on a points system. Children are expected to obtain a certain amount of points in examinations. When certain people are unable to obtain this amount, they find it very difficult to come to terms with it.We also need to examine the structures that are there to help people, particularly young people, who are experiencing trauma. It is fair to say that the pain of mental and emotional trauma is far worse than any physical pain. We must also look at the mistakes of the past. At one time, there was a considerable stigma associated with the tragedy of a person taking his or her life, which was largely due to the attitude of the institutional churches. This stigma added to the pain of surviving family members. There is a need for structures and caring preventative measures to be put in place and resources to implement them. We need a national suicide strategy as a priority and we need the resources to implement it on an all-Ireland basis.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	My first real exposure to suicide was as a young trainee GP in Swinford, County Mayo, when I saw two elderly men both laid out side by side on a slab in the mortuary in Swinford Hospital. The sight of two men lying side by side with the track of a rope on their necks is one that will stay with me for the rest of my life. These two men did not know one another but one heard about the other committing suicide and decided to end his life as well. It appeared to me to be a terrible waste of life. I looked at the men's situations and discovered they had families. Yet they felt so lonely and depressed they decided to end it all.The situation has grown even sadder since then because we have seen the alarming rate of increase in young people taking their own lives. This has happened over the years since I was a young GP in Swinford. Many things have changed since then. Society has changed and become more Americanised and more orientated towards profit and money. God has been replaced by the god of money. It is all about having it all and getting on with it. If a person cannot get on with it, he or she is pushed to the side.People face pressures from all sides, including the media. People face pressures to perform, to be the smartest, the most beautiful, the most slender, the most successful or the person who gets laid every night. These are terrible messages that are being directed at people all the time. These messages are forms of pure propaganda by people who are just trying to make money out of young people and society in general. We see it in the care of the elderly, which we debated yesterday in the House. The Government is aiding and abetting a situation that is all about profit. We should all take part in looking after older people but we have given it over totally to private operators who, in the absence of anything else, are doing the best job they can. However, it is still private enterprise and operators who have to turn a profit. Why do we not look after older people ourselves? Why are communities not doing it? Communities could look after older people. Why should care of the elderly be profit-driven and not community based? We can look after older people in our communities and some communities are doing it.We have made a god of money and put these terrible pressures on our young people. They are born, through no fault of their own, into a society which has these pressures. It is time we examined these pressures. Where is Government money being spent? It is being spent on so many silly, difficult, rotten things that really do not matter. The money should be spent on psychiatric services. We know the graph for alcohol consumption goes way up, together with the binge drinking of our young people. We also know that the money that needs to go into psychiatric services is not available. These are things we know for certain.I also know for certain, as a GP, that supports are not available. So many people — one quarter — come to their GP before committing suicide yet I think that sometimes GPs do not have the resources to deal with this. The answers are obvious. There is an onus on us to work towards a better society. This means putting the resources in place to support the things that matter.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on suicide and suicide prevention, which are extremely important issues. It is important that suicide is addressed in this House and it is probably a healthy sign of our development that we can talk about it and acknowledge that a problem exists. In doing so, I pay a particular tribute to Deputy Neville for the pioneering work he has carried out over recent years and organisations like the Bethany bereavement groups, which have carried out tremendous work throughout the country.Suicide is always a tragedy, for the person whose life has ended and for the family, friends and community that have been left behind. Suicide has an intensely devastating effect. I know of many families in my constituency, some of them very close friends, who have had to bear this intense loss. It is always difficult to accept and understand. The resulting pain, anguish and sometimes anger affects not only the family of the deceased but the entire community in which he or she lived. Over the past 20 years the suicide rate in Ireland has increased at an alarming rate. During the 1980s and 1990s, we experienced the fastest increase in Europe, albeit from a low base. In 2003, the Central Statistics Office recorded the number of registered suicides as 444. Today, every 45 minutes at least one Irish person will attempt to die by suicide. These figures are shocking. There probably is not a family in the State which has not been affected or touched in some way by suicide.What concerns me further about the statistics are the specific groups that are affected by the trend. More than four times as many men as women died by suicide in 2003 — 358 males and 86 females. There is a statistical link between unemployment and suicide, especially in young men, and rates of suicidal behaviour are higher among manual occupation groups. Research shows that suicide rates in the lowest social class are almost four times as high as in the highest earning brackets. Most frightening is that our rate of youth suicide is very high. A total of 30% of all deaths in the 15 to 24 year old age group in 2003 were recorded as suicide. In the 25 to 34 year old age group, the figure was 23%, making it the largest cause of death in both groups. Ireland now has the second highest youth suicide rate of the 30 OECD countries.What are the reasons for this dramatic increase in suicides in this country? Is it even that straightforward just to point to the causes? After all, most people do not understand suicide — I do not understand it. However, by examining the research we can gain some knowledge and understanding of this alarming trend.Between 40% and 60% of those who die through suicide have made previous attempts. Psychiatric disorders or addiction problems are present in 90% of people who take their own lives. With the increasing mental distress, a person's ability to find solutions to their problems, or even to imagine there could be solutions, diminishes. It is at this stage that suicide can be seen as a meaningful alternative. This thought seems to occur more readily to men, those living alone and people who feel alienated from society.Not everyone with depression attempts suicide so it is clear that other factors are relevant. A culture of alcohol abuse is a factor in these high numbers. In young people in particular, the sequence of events leading to suicide may start with alcohol or illicit drug use. There has also been reference to the decline in traditional religious belief systems, which occurred at the same time as rapid social and economic change in this country. I am not qualified to state whether there is a causal link between the two.In an effort to address these issues and the increase in suicide, the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998 made a total of 86 recommendations under various headings, such as the provision of services, prevention, intervention and after care. Since 1998, significant progress has been made in implementing the report. A suicide resource officer has been appointed in each HSE area and liaison psychiatric nurses have been appointed to accident and emergency departments in general hospitals. Provision has also been made for training relevant health care personnel in regard to suicidal behaviour and such training is ongoing in all HSE regions. In addition, the national suicide review group, the National Suicide Research Foundation and the national parasuicide registry have been established to research further the causes behind this trend.Legislation has been enacted restricting the availability of medication which can be used to overdose. A social and personal health education programme has been developed and is now compulsory for all junior cycle students in secondary schools. However, more can always be done and, although statistics show that the growth in the numbers attempting suicide has slowed recently, we must strive to reduce the figure entirely.An interesting point was made during a previous debate on suicide in the House. It was that suicide is not chosen but happens when the pain one feels exceeds the resources for coping with that pain. We all experience real pain at some stage in our lives but dealing with the pain is crucial. It is the resources available to us to deal with it that can make the difference.The most effective way to tackle suicide is to provide early support and intervention and to provide the most effective resources for people to cope with events in their lives before all hope is lost. Looking at the policies of our European counterparts, the Finnish strategy is particularly comprehensive and well developed. It is the only national strategy that has a framework with a clear definition of suicide prevention. This prevention strategy is at several levels. Primary prevention aims to enhance every individual's inner resources and living conditions. Secondary prevention attempts to eliminate or reduce conditions such as mental illness, intoxicant problems, physical illness and life crises which, under certain circumstances, can lead to suicide. Tertiary prevention focuses on those who have attempted or planned suicide and the methods they use.A range of supports and interventions needs to be introduced where the focus is on enhancing coping skills, creative options and problem solving approaches to crises. Major emphasis must be placed on addressing public attitudes to depressive and other psychiatric disorders. We should seek to enhance further awareness of depression and its recognition and treatment in general practice. We must improve access to the psychiatric services. We must also examine ways to reduce the impact of life crises, including unemployment, marital breakdown and alcohol related problems. There is a need to provide improved training for our front line workers so situations can be identified early. Most importantly, we must seriously target suicide among our youth, especially young men, for special attention. Emphasis should be placed on the need to build self-esteem, to detect anger management issues and to diminish the sense of alienation that many teenagers feel.While suicide rates are higher in young adults, many of the risk facts and associated behaviour problems are established in adolescence. If we can target this behaviour early, we can really make a difference to their lives. Teenagers need somebody to talk to, particularly at critical times. It is important that we understand the particular needs in that regard and provide adequate counselling and psychiatric services for them. We appear to have a growing development of services for children and adults but young adolescents appear to be falling between the two, with fatal consequences.Tackling suicide as a single issue will never bring success. Suicide prevention measures must take account of broader socioeconomic and environmental issues, particularly those associated with social justice, education, health, inequality and community affairs. I urge the Government to continue its work in this regard. There is a job to be done and, as legislators, we have a responsibility to deal with suicide and to reduce the risk of suicide.Over the last few decades, dramatic medical and scientific advances have occurred with regard to many killer diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. These advances came about through dedication and determination from statutory and powerful agencies and from relentless advocates who, together, have advanced the health of the Irish nation. Now, suicide represents the new age killer. If we are to stamp it out once and for all, the same dedication and determination must be shown by all.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I feel somewhat inadequate contributing to this debate in the presence of Deputy Neville, having listened to his contribution. I join Deputy Carey in praising Deputy Neville and others who have done so much work on this issue.Suicide in Ireland is now at unprecedented levels. The reasons for this are complex. To reduce the rate of suicide we need integrated comprehensive plans. I am aware that recommendations have been made. I wish to raise one issue in the time available to me. Teachings on the excessive use of alcohol, drug abuse, what we value, what we do not value, self-restraint, self-denial and mercy are messages carried by organised religious groups such as Christians, the Jewish community, Muslims and others. If, for young people in particular, this teaching is replaced by "anything goes" and what feels good, despair cannot be too far behind.As a young Muslim man who worked for me last year put it, the term "jihad" is much misunderstood. Jihad is what we each face daily, the struggle between what is right and wrong. We all do wrong but if we recognise the wrong, because there are some beliefs or a moral system guiding us, we can make amends and strive for what is right. If we do not know that internal jihad, confusion and despair can easily follow. For many of us, the teaching that equipped us to handle this jihad came in the main from religious sources, with all its faults and human failings. Can we actually create an environment where religious practice is respected and encouraged, although not forced? Should we do so?Religious practice is as much part of who we are as a people as is culture, language or, for example, hurling. If hurling or art were to be threatened we would act. In the case of religion, some of us seem to rejoice in its apparent decline. Some of this is due to abuse that has been perpetuated, some because of the harshness with which some religious leaders behaved in the past.Rev. Dr. Eoin Cassidy, in his book The Search for Meaning and Values, published by Veritas in 2004, refers to the philosopher Alistair MacIntyre of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. If MacIntyre is correct, liberal individualist culture provides neither a basis for moral discourse nor a context for rationally securing agreement on any moral issue because it cannot sustain the wherewithal to create a moral community. What is necessary for a moral community to exist is some shared sense that there is a purpose to existence and some level of agreement as to what that purpose might entail. MacIntyre’s view is that western culture has lost connection to the idea of virtue and what it means to be a virtuous person, or even what it means to aspire to be a virtuous person.In his opinion we possess only the fragments of a former conceptual scheme; we possess such words as goodness, virtue, a virtuous life, and so on, but we have lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, of morality. He states:In this context, there is no rational way to gain moral agreement, hence, for all practical purposes, we are living in what might be called an emotivist culture, one which proclaims that all judgements are nothing but expressions of preference, attitude or feeling.This may be a pessimistic appraisal but if we are to make a start to creating a society where the despair or indifference which leads to suicide is less prevalent, we must begin with a thoughtful re-appraisal of some of the philosophies which have helped bring us to this point.Iris Murdoch, the Irish-born, Oxford-based novelist and philosopher, who died in 1999, was the recipient of numerous awards and accolades. Rather than the empty external freedom of existentialism, Murdoch looks to an alternative view that places emphasis on the growth of freedom that accompanies a growth in the person, and one that shifts the emphasis in morality from the world of action to that of vision. According to Murdoch, modern ethical theories such as behaviourism, utilitarianism or existentialism cannot account adequately for either moral progress or moral failure because they have no sense of the existence of an appropriate goal towards which they ought to strive and which does justice to the seriousness of the ethical project.As Rev. Dr. Eoin Cassidy states, Christians believe it is by reflecting on mystery, truth, goodness, beauty and love that one can begin to explore the mystery of God and the manner in which God is revealed in the world. These privileged dimensions of creation and, in particular, human existence can be described as the four footprints of God in the world, according to Dr. Cassidy. However, in the search for meaning and value, it is not only the Christian churches which can contribute. In October 1965 under the title Nostra Aetate— In Our Time — a short declaration, inspired by Vatican II, on religious and spiritual interpretations of experience was issued. This vision is well articulated in the following passage from Nostra Aetate:Human beings look to their different religions for an answer to the unsolved riddles of human existence. The problems that weigh heavily on the hearts of human beings are the same today as in the ages past. What is the person? What is the meaning and purpose of life? What is upright behaviour, and what is sinful? Where does suffering originate, and what end does it serve? How can genuine happiness be found? What happens at death? What is judgement? What reward follows death? And finally, what is the ultimate mystery, beyond human explanation that embraces our entire existence, from which we take our origin and towards which we tend?All this might seem a very strange contribution on the subject of suicide. We need better youth service facilities, more education on the abuse of alcohol and early warning systems. However, on their own, these will not go to the heart of the ills in society which have given rise to such a high rate of suicide.Politicians can no more reverse the trends in suicide than we can create jobs, for example. However, we can create the environment in which employment will have the opportunity to flourish. We can also help create the environment which contributes to the search for meaning and value that leads people away from despair. To do that, we must start talking more about the value of religious teaching and belief. We must respect those who hold religious beliefs, as well as those who do not. The trend towards only one type of society, an assimilated society, where secularism is almost a universal religion and the only one to be respected, is a recipe for despair. Our society must be about integration not assimilation. Have we learned nothing from the birth of the European Union or the Troubles of Northern Ireland?The essential point I want to make is as follows. If we are to lead young people away from despair and hopelessness, they must be given hope, vision and leadership. They will not hear this message of hope exclusively in the home or exclusively from the tongues of other leaders like politicians or trade unionists, and they are unlikely to get it from the business class. One sector of our society, with all its excesses and abuses, has in the past tried to imbue a sense of moral values. That sector is the religious, largely Christian, sector. It is now a very much more mixed sector with different Christian religions, a strong Muslim community and, sadly, a declining Jewish community.One aspect those groups have in common is a wish to try to imbue people with a sense of what is right and wrong. I do not want to return to the excesses of religious leadership, or anything akin to a shadow-state within a state. I do not want a society where the parish priest controls who uses the local community hall or where the Muslim teacher imbues intolerance. However, I do want a society where sport, culture, art, politics and religion co-exist. Organised religion has a contribution to make in leading people away from despair and in seeking to equip society with a value system that helps when trying times are present. The new Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, has stated his Church must find new ways of evangelising. I fully support and encourage that, and believe it would help if women and married people were allowed a full role in that new model.The Beatitudes tells us that blessed are the merciful for they shall be shown mercy. One of the less palatable manifestations of the wrongs of Ireland's society is the absence of mercy. We are all at it — journalists, businessmen and politicians. Has our inability to show mercy created an atmosphere or attitude in which suicide can thrive? This is a question worthy of consideration and debate. Would it be unthinkable to have a White Paper on the role of religion in society? Foreign policy and education are not the only important areas which should receive such consideration and analysis. To turn society around and to reduce the number of suicides requires a multifaceted approach.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the issue of suicide, particularly in light of the recent statistics showing that north Tipperary had the distinction of the worst figures for completed self-terminations in the Republic. I share the public concern about the level of suicide nationally and welcome the earlier statement to the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I am aware also, as laid out by the Minister, of the progress made at a national level by the Government, the health services and the voluntary sector since the national task force on suicide in 1998.Suicide is a difficult subject for governments and health services to grapple with. One cannot legislate out of existence the diverse and complex pressures and stresses that lead people to take the drastic action of ending or attempting to end their lives. Social or economic and personal regulation by the Government cannot ever entirely hope to eradicate this phenomenon. However, the State has a duty of care to do all it can to set in place systems and procedures to guide our public servants in the general health services, mental health services, social welfare and educational sectors to best prevent self-destruction. In 2003 north Tipperary suffered twice the national average number of suicides.

The mid-west region which Deputy Neville, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, and I represent, has high suicide figures, which is very saddening. This is a huge social concern and we cannot understand why so many take their own lives. Suicide defies the application of any hard and fast certainties arising from research into the phenomenon.Some 96% of Irish suicides are related to mental illnesses, ranging from depression to schizophrenia. I am particularly concerned for north Tipperary in this regard. GPs and nurses have been campaigning for improved mental health services in the area for some time and have been supported by Deputies from every party. The current north Tipperary team consists of one consultant psychiatrist, one clinical psychologist, one addiction counsellor and one social worker. The team, which provides general practitioner contact and support, day hospital interventions, outpatient clinics, day centre services and domiciliary interventions, serves a growing population of 70,000 people. There are no weekend services for psychiatric or mental health care in north Tipperary at the present time. If an emergency is clearly identified, the person must be referred to St. Michael's in Clonmel which is 50 miles from Nenagh and 70-miles from Lorrha, the most northerly parish in Tipperary. This is unacceptable. There is no public transport system in place to accommodate people who must travel to Clonmel under such circumstances.After-hours psychiatric posts advertised in October 2002 have not been filled and seem to have evaporated. The Minister of State should investigate the matter. There are plenty of psychiatric nurses qualified for such positions but a shroud of mystery covers the health services in the mid-west region. Responses are poor and contact is not up to the expected standards. Where did the jobs go? Were they adequately advertised? There is a great need in north Tipperary and the greater mid-west region for these posts to be filled and services to be provided.I pay tribute to the voluntary sector, particularly the Living Links programme for which north Tipperary has again received funding this afternoon through the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The programme involves volunteers who engage in very rewarding and valuable work in north Tipperary and other areas. The Rainbows programme is aimed at school-going children, from primary to secondary level. Within parishes, it is targeted towards children who have been bereaved. Unfortunately the service is only provided once the bereavement has taken place. It is increasingly important that supports be put in place so that there is less need for them. We must address the issue early on and not after the event.I wish to highlight the deficit of weekend services and the supports in place in Limerick. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, will be familiar with these schemes. The scheme to which I refer is based in Limerick Regional Hospital and has been running for four years. The services are provided until 3 a.m. at weekends. If only north Tipperary had the same support in place. I pay tribute to the staff at Glenroyd in Tyone, Nenagh who provide mental health services for the greater north Tipperary area. However, they are in dire need of increased services and support. This issue must be urgently addressed and I have been pushing the Department of Health and Children for these services to be improved.It is difficult to legislate for an issue such as this. We can, through our education system, help young people to become better communicators. It is no coincidence that the national rate of suicides has risen greatly as our society has become modernised and detached from traditional community life. We need to do more than simply provide a troupe of mental health professionals. This country takes pride in the fact that we are the greatest exporter of software and excel in the area of information technology. Technology means greater communication but there is a greater need for parent-child interaction in the family home. People must be facilitated with flexible working hours so that they have more time with their children during the precious childhood years.The development of interpersonal skills in schools, sports clubs and playgrounds has been damaged by the increasing isolation experienced by the population as a result of the daily stresses and pace of life. In rural communities such as north Tipperary the mechanisms for dealing with these changes are only being developed. Irish society has had to modernise quickly and, for the most part, it is doing well. However, we cannot become complacent and ignore those struggling in the wake of this transition.Two weeks ago the Sunday Independent rather cruelly described many of today’s suicides as emotional tantrums; the result of traumas such as discovering one is homosexual, the dissolution of a romantic relationship, parent-child conflicts and dashed expectations for a perfect life. However the article made a good point when it stated that we are not furnishing young people with the emotional tools to deal with life’s downside, something that no Government can prevent.I welcome Deputy Gay Mitchell's comment with regard to the need for greater spiritual awareness and renewal. It is a controversial issue within our schools. However, as Ireland has become more secular, the supports of a growing spiritual life have been challenged. Spirituality is a vital support for people who have experienced trauma and are therefore prone to depression. The education system has much room for improvement in this regard.A double approach to general mental health and awareness must be developed. Greater social justice and access to educational opportunities have greatly improved the lives of many in north Tipperary, but not in every case. There are people for whom the Celtic tiger never happened and whose community life has altered so much as to be unrecognisable from that which existed in 1990. Unprecedented debt and addiction to new substances have challenged many. The growing belief that success and happiness can be measured in terms of material wealth will bankrupt the very people who are least prepared to navigate the new economic landscape of the nation. Suicide is a product of these and many other factors, although it would be an insult to the dead to attempt to list them all.The Offaly County Coroner, Mr. Brian Mahon, noted that most suicide cases are completely different but have a common thread, such as mental illness and alcohol and substance abuse. The Government must aid nurses, doctors and teachers in providing an accessible and caring holistic approach to those who contemplate suicide. We must combat it with life skills, emotional awareness and communication. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I wish to share time with Deputy Stanton.I welcome this opportunity to make a statement regarding the serious problem of suicide, especially among young males. I commend Deputy Neville on his positive activity in the area at national level at a time when open discussion on this tragic issue is often despised.Some 444 deaths were registered as suicide in 2003 which is a serious indictment of our society. There may be more than that registered figure. Eight of the 86 proposals made by the national task force on suicide have been implemented. That is unacceptable and it questions the relevance of setting up groups to propose strategies if they are to be virtually ignored.I want to raise a specific case that has caused great anxiety to me personally as well as to many other people. The man involved in this particular case was at the older end of the age spectrum. Fred Williamson, at 70 years of age and recovering from a serious illness, found himself without family back-up and in serious depression. He begged the authorities to take him into care for a few weeks at least, or longer if necessary, to see if he could benefit from such care. However, they insisted that he was a patient suitable for home care and not in-house accommodation. That care was tried for a number of weeks and, once again, through my office, I begged the authorities on his behalf to re-examine his situation, taking into account his home difficulties. I was assured they were fully aware of those difficulties but that he should be either treated at home or in a home for the elderly. His two sisters lived in England and were not in a position to look after him.On the last day I was in consultation with him, I spent two hours on a Monday evening on the phone to the psychiatric services without success. I had to leave the country on business that night and did not arrive back until Friday. I did not get further information from the psychiatric services but I got a phone call at 12 o'clock on Saturday to advise me of Freddie's death. I appreciate that senior personnel from the services made themselves available to the family after the event on Saturday, and possibly again on Sunday, but I genuinely believe that a situation like this one, where there was a clear cry for help, should not and must not be ignored.I put this case on the record not in a vindictive way but in the slight hope that somebody will listen and ensure that when people like this man cry out for help, they will be listened to. This death is one of four similar deaths in my immediate area within a few short weeks of each other. I appreciate the fact that the VEC organised two very successful open meetings in County Monaghan to discuss this issue and try to get some help for those who are left behind because they are the ones who have to deal with one of life's most difficult situations.I beg the Government to treat this issue with sincerity and urgency, make every effort to deal with the cases it knows about and, through the educational structures, try to deal with the possible problems. We must recognise that young people, especially young males, are no longer actively involved in Church structures and find it more difficult to discuss their anxieties. The churches no longer appear to be as relevant and young people do not have the same access to clerics and others involved in churches.There is also a major problem with family structures and poor family life when two members are working. There is a lack of the older type family support. One has to examine the situation in Belfast where so many people have taken their own lives by suicide, perhaps partly related to the troubles. There is also the problem of isolation in rural Ireland, which I believe will get worse rather than better.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I express sympathy to those who have experienced suicide in their families, many of whom I know, as do my colleagues. I remember at one time looking into a coffin where a young man of 22 with curly hair lay who had committed suicide. He should not have been in that coffin. He had his whole life ahead of him. I said to him, "You should not be in there". How many of us over the years have been in similar sad circumstances?The official figure for suicides is 444 but the real figure is probably much higher than that, perhaps over 500 per year if one takes single car accidents, drownings and so on into account. If two jumbo jets crashed every year in Ireland, would the Government take notice? One can imagine the reaction to that. When responding I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House what he has done in his time in office and what he intends to do about this issue.Alcohol is a major factor in suicide. We must tackle that problem because my experience is that many people who commit suicide, young men in particular, were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the suicide or shortly before it. Alcohol is a depressant drug that is greatly abused in this country and whatever else we do we must not extend the scope of its availability.There is also a breakdown between the person and society — Durkheim called it anomie years ago. I have called on the Government to examine youth services. We need professional youth workers on the ground who can interact with young people outside school. Schools cannot solve every problem. The school environment can be artificial. I dealt with schools for 20 years and I know what I am talking about. Programmes in schools have limited value. We need youth workers on the ground in our towns and villages to interact with young people and identify those at risk.We also need training for professionals. We must train young people to pick up cues from their peers. When a young man says "Life is not worth living", his friend might hear that cue, ask him to explain what he means and then direct him to help. We need more services in this area. Professionals must be available at the end of a phone line 24 hours a day, seven days a week or in hospitals to which people can go and get help immediately. We must also raise awareness about mental health issues. Deputy Neville has worked hard on that issue. That is something the Minister should do immediately.We are turning into an economy, not a society. We must stop and think about that. I welcome this debate but we need a long debate with more Members involved in it because this is a vitally important issue that impacts on communities.Families with teenage children are worried sick about the plague of suicide in our society and we must do much more about it than we have done until now. The President set up a forum recently. Communities that experience suicide set up their own groups but they are working hard and struggling to deal with this major problem but no leadership is being given. The recommendations that came forward included setting up a national body to co-ordinate these groups in the area of suicide prevention. That is something the Minister should do immediately. That was recommended by the forum the President set up, and I congratulate her on that.There is too much fragmentation in this area. The various groups are doing their own thing and there is duplication of the work. They all believe they have the answer to the problem but no one group has the answer. I have met many of those groups and they are frustrated because they get so far and then come up against an obstacle. My own town, Midleton, in east Cork, has had a major issue with this over the years. Action is needed to deal with this problem immediately and I challenge the Minister to get working on it.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I will be brief. I compliment the Minister on his work in this area to date, the sincere way he is approaching the issue of suicide and his commitment to the task. I listened carefully to Deputy Neville's contribution to the debate, and I listened to his comments outside it, and he is to be complimented on leading the campaign on this issue. Far too many families are affected by suicide.The services must be expanded rapidly and must include funding, not just for community care beyond the psychiatric hospitals but also in bringing in expertise from outside the country and making it available to those who need it. Families with relatives suffering from depression and threatening suicide must be able to find the type of care needed for that family member. Such care must be made available because those families should not have to fight with the authorities to get the services they need.On a local issue, I ask the Minister to re-examine the Ryan case in St. Canice's Hospital. It involves a death that occurred unnecessarily in the hospital some years ago. The family has continued to try to get the case reopened and properly investigated. I ask the Minister to examine that issue and deal with it. Another family is suffering trauma and sadness and is unable to let go because death was caused by suicide and the family believes questions need to be answered.Dr. Harding Price was struck off by the Privy Council in England but he is able to practise in this country. He was employed by the South Eastern Health Board and there are many cases in that area where questions need to be answered. Those families are affected by the decision taken, which cannot be explained as he is barred from any kind of practice in the UK. The documentation is available on the Internet and must be read to be believed, yet the authorities here have sanctioned the resumption of his practice while cases are still unresolved in the south east. These cases relate to family members touched by deep depression, with the threat of suicide. That is incredible and I have written a letter to the Minister asking her to reopen the case to see if the suspension can be continued and if the decision of the Medical Council can be overturned, or at least suspended until a further investigation takes place. Given the problems, we cannot afford this type of approach, which falls short of best practice, within our system.As the Deputy mentioned there is a need for a wider debate encompassing the use of drugs and alcohol. The greatest curse I see in my clinic every week is the effects of drug and alcohol abuse on the people abusing, their families and their extended families, and the difficulties in convincing the current structures within our psychiatric services to deal with them, to reach out and be proactive in support for these families in the home, or to take them in and deal with them in a hospital setting.In Kilkenny a multi-million euro, state-of-the-art hospital was recently opened. We need to build the appropriate staffing levels, skills and qualification around that to ensure we can deal with this issue. The Minister should not be shy in asking the Government to put money into projects that deal with this issue. For far too many years the mental health services have not received a proportionate amount of the billions of euro we have invested in the health services.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I thank Deputy McGuinness for allowing me to contribute. Considering the figures for suicide, self-harm and non-fatal suicidal behaviour over the last ten years, it is clear this is an increasing problem among young people. In 2003, 440 cases of suicide and 11,000 cases of deliberate self-harm were referred to accident and emergency departments through the national parasuicide register. We also know that those at high risk of suicide are young men between the ages of 20 and 34, for whom suicide is now the first cause of mortality. Among those who harm themselves the majority are young men, although this behaviour is increasing among young women. There is still too much speculation about the causes and risk factors as to why suicide and deliberate self-harm has increased in Ireland in recent years. Most people who are depressed do not die of suicide and do not harm themselves so one of the priorities should be to find out more about the specific cause and risk factors that are associated with suicide and deliberate self-harm. We do not even know if young people who harm themselves are the same people who die by suicide years later. We can only speculate about this because evidence is lacking.As Deputies will be aware from recent media coverage many initiatives are being developed to address the problem of suicidal behaviour. This is a reflection of the increased commitment of people all over Ireland to work towards prevention. Most of the initiatives are ad hoc and there is a clear lack of co-ordination at national level. This is not helpful in the long term. Long-term planning and investment in research and prevention of suicidal behaviour is needed. We need to support ongoing long-term efforts in research and prevention such as work by the National Suicide Research Foundation and the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, which will be launched this year.I wish to give credit to a new organisation, Suicide, Teach, Observe and Prevent, STOP. It was set up by two families from Dromahaire, County Leitrim. Both of these had sons who committed suicide last year. In an attempt to understand more about what happened to their sons they conducted research and discovered frightening statistics in the north west. A figure of 450 people, mostly young males, committed suicide and over 10,000 attempted to do so. STOP aims to educate mental health professionals and to turn a spotlight on the epidemic of suicide that exists in the north west.

I would welcome a debate at any time and obviously we have not had enough time this afternoon. Several other speakers wished to contribute.In my initial remarks I welcomed the President's intervention in calling a forum and the points made by Dr. Bates on the "Marian Finucane" programme recently. I hope the other speakers were not insinuating the President acted because of a lack of leadership on my part. I discussed this matter with the President and I welcome any contribution from anybody to solve the problem. Deputy Gay Mitchell correctly pointed out that the problem of suicide goes right across society. It is not a matter for one particular political party, and it concerns all societies, not just in Ireland.I concur with all other speakers on the involvement of Deputy Neville in this issue. I thank him for his contribution again today. He is right in saying that unemployment is one of the biggest factors in suicide and recent reports agree with that. I disagree with Senator Neville that only eight of the 86 recommendations——

Many of the recommendations are ongoing. There are several recommendations on training doctors. That will take years to do. I have strong views on the education of doctors and their participation in the mental health area. I have said that training of doctors in the psychiatric area has been taken over by the pharmaceutical industry. I have asked many people to look into that.I agree with Deputy Neville's comments on alcohol, which is a wider issue and a major problem in our society. The mental health tribunals have not yet gone ahead and this is not due to a lack of resources, but because of an industrial dispute between psychiatrists and the HSE. I attended a meeting yesterday and another meeting took place today. I appeal to the psychiatrists to engage with the tribunals as soon as possible. I believe progress is taking place and I hope the psychiatrists will come on board. We need them on the tribunals as we are dealing with the most vulnerable people who have been involuntarily detained in psychiatric institutions.I agree with the speakers' points on inequality and unfairness in our society. As several speakers have said, our media focus on success and as Deputy Higgins said in the previous debate we have an unfair society and do not pay enough attention to the vulnerable and the disadvantaged groups.Deputy Carey is correct in his comment that we should not tackle suicide in isolation. It is a much bigger problem, and I await the expert group that will report later this year. They will specifically speak about suicide, but they will speak about the whole area of mental health, which is a challenge for all of us. I applaud Deputy Gay Mitchell's contribution about the value of the respective contributions of the various churches to our society. That is something upon which we can all ponder.I agree with Deputy Stanton's comments about training. I have been listening.

I am giving that leadership. While there are no instant fixes, I want to do it in collaboration with many people, especially voluntary groups. We must work with them in driving forward the positive mental health message.As the economy has progressed, those who have not succeeded, in society's view, have been left behind and not enough attention was paid to their contribution. Many who opt out and fail in the points system are some of the most creative people in society. Unfortunately, society, including the media, regards them as failures. Much work remains to be done in the area of mental health.I thank all contributors to this debate which was very worthwhile. I will return to the House at any time in the future to discuss this matter again.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The allocation for 2005 provides for an increase of €70 million in Government spending on official development assistance this year. This will bring total Government aid to the developing world to approximately €545 million in 2005. This is the highest allocation in the 30-year history of our overseas aid programme. In addition, the Government has agreed to provide further increases of €65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. These substantial increases mean that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, €1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance. As a result, Ireland will maintain its position as one of the world's leading aid donors on a per capita basis. In addition, this three-year multi-annual commitment, incorporating substantial annual increases, gives my Department a sound basis to carry forward the long-term planning which is so important for development work.Ireland has successfully focused its aid programme on the needs of the poorest people in the poorest countries. Ireland is one of only six countries to have surpassed the target, endorsed by the UN, of contributing at least 0.15% of gross national product in overseas development assistance to the world's least developed countries. The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target for expenditure on ODA. The issue of how best to meet the target and in what timeframe is under ongoing review.Under the Government's decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, is scheduled to be decentralised to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. Details of applications received for the posts in question, excluding applications from civil servants already serving in Limerick, are set out in the table accompanying this reply.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Department is working closely with the Office of Public Works to identify suitable accommodation for the directorate in Limerick and it is hoped to select a premises in the near future. Pending this, it is not possible to estimate savings or additional costs.The various issues arising from the Government decision, both for the Department in general and for the development co-operation directorate, in particular, are considered in the Department's decentralisation implementation plan. Risk analysis carried out by the directorate in this context has identified the following as the main risk factors, and for which appropriate risk mitigation strategies are being implemented: financial, including accountability and control; human resources, including loss of expertise and institutional memory; communications between the directorate and internal and external stakeholders; and associated operational and reputational risks. The implementation plan, which has been published on the Department's website www.dfa.ie, was recently revised to take account of the decision to include the directorate among the early movers.I am making available the following table detailing applications via the central applications facility for DCD posts in Limerick.Specialist GradesNumber of posts advertised on the CAFNumber of applications from within the DirectorateDCD applications as a percentage of total postsApplications from elsewhere in the DepartmentApplications received via the CAF by 7 September 2004Applications received via the CAF since 7 September 2004Total received to date%Principal Development Specialist3000000Senior Development Specialist122170002Development Specialist99 (Note 1)1000009Financial Controller1000000Non-Specialist GradesCounsellor /Principal Officer7000426First Secretary /Assistant Principal Officer19316012621Higher Executive Officer / Administrative Officer1417125128Third Secretary42502004Executive Officer16319323837Staff Officer2001304Clerical Officer3313419327Services Officer3001001Totals1232117128620139Note 1:

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I would like to see the table, but that is another story. Is the Minister of State not embarrassed by his recent statement welcoming the European Union's commitment to attaining the 0.7% GNP target by 2010? Will he give me a straight answer to a straight question? Will that target of 0.7% of GNP, which was reneged on by the Taoiseach after he gave that commitment at the United Nations in 2000, be reached by 2008, 2010, 2012 or 2015? Can the Minister of State tell me on what date this target will be reached? Is he embarrassed by the fact that he welcomed the EU's lead, while some months ago both he and the Taoiseach claimed they were taking the lead on overseas aid?As regards the decentralisation of the development co-operation directorate, does the Minister agree that none of the ten management staff is among those who have offered to go to Limerick? The move to Limerick will decimate the DCD unit which has strong expertise in dealing with Third World countries and non-governmental organisations. The work of the DCD will be severely hampered by the attempts to force its staff out of Dublin where much of the work is being done.

In addition, within the European Council of Development Ministers and the Council of Foreign Ministers, Ireland has taken a major lead in this regard. Along with many other small donor countries, Ireland prompted the move to have a clear European target. The 2010 date referred to by Deputy Allen is, in fact, the interim target date. The 15 old EU member states — as distinct from the ten new ones which have a different target figure and timeframe — are required to reach an interim target of 0.51% of GNI by 2010, leading to full achievement.

Ireland is among a small number of those 15 countries which are either on that figure or well on the way to achieving it. Our overseas development aid programme has tripled in size since we got into Government in 1997. Ireland is the ninth largest donor in the world, with 50% of that expenditure going to the poorest countries on Earth. That is a great achievement for which Ireland has been positively evaluated internationally. There were two non-governmental assessments of our overseas development aid programme in the last week or two. One such assessment ranked us second in the world, while the other ranked us first in terms of practice and roll-out of the programme.I want to answer some of the questions the Deputy raised cornering the decentralisation of the development co-operation directorate to Limerick, because they contained some numerical inaccuracies.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I am not doing any disservice to that union but I think the situation is clear. There are 123 staff to be moved to Limerick. Some 114 people have applied in the first round to be part of that move. Therefore, we have received 114 applications to go to Limerick. Some 35 of those are from within the Department of Foreign Affairs and 19 of those 35 are from the development co-operation division that I supervise.The Deputy may be confused about the specialists. We have 23 development specialists based in the development co-operation division's headquarters here in Dublin. Some 11 of those 23 have volunteered to go to Limerick. I understand the Deputy's motivation in raising this issue. It is a matter of concern that this move to Limerick should not disrupt or put in jeopardy our well developed overseas development assistance programme. I am glad to inform the House that the current director general, who was previously our ambassador in Vienna, was brought back just prior to my taking office last September. He was brought back deliberately so that we could have a smooth transition to Limerick. That man, the most senior official in the Department, has volunteered to go to Limerick. That is one of the reasons he was brought back. In the past week we have had two additional, extra counsellor-rank people coming into the section to boost and assist in the transition.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I wish the Minister of State would give shorter answers, so that we could ask supplementary questions. This is almost like a filibuster.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.The Government very much regrets the outcome of the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the European constitution. However, we fully respect the democratic right of the people of each country to make their own decision, as we respect the decisions of those other member states that have already ratified the constitution.The European constitution can only enter into force if and when all 25 member states have ratified it. The situation is complex and it is important that the EU should move forward in a considered and united way. We hope the discussion at the European Council on 16-17 June will be significant in helping to chart the way forward.In the run up to the European Council, contacts with partners at all levels will continue. The Taoiseach is today meeting Chancellor Schroeder and Prime Minister Juncker, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs held informal discussions with colleagues in Luxembourg earlier this week. The Government remains committed to the European constitution and to its ratification by Ireland. The constitution is the product of an unprecedentedly open and lengthy debate at the European Convention, followed by a full Intergovernmental Conference. The text that emerged represents a carefully balanced compromise among all 25 member states, and meets all of Ireland's concerns.While the European Union can and will continue to operate on the basis of the current treaties, we believe the constitution would bring about a number of significant improvements. It consolidates and clarifies the mass of existing treaties. It sets out the EU values, objectives and principles in a clear, balanced and durable way. It would help the enlarged EU to operate more effectively, both internally and externally, enhance the fundamental rights of European citizens and help make the union more open and democratic, with greater roles both for national parliaments and the European Parliament. We continue strongly to support the European constitution because it is in Ireland's interests and in Europe's interests.We continue also to prepare for ratification by the target date of November 2006. As the House is aware, last week the Government published the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Publication of the Bill allows for the establishment of the referendum commission through an order made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Government has also prepared a White Paper to help inform the public, which will be ready for publication shortly.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Does the Minister of State regard that the neo-liberal agenda being pushed to its extreme, for example, regarding the working day, the working week and the Aubert principles was an issue in the French referendum, in other words that the emphasis was on the competition side rather than the cohesion side, as it was in Lisbon?The Minister of State referred to his "regrets". Does he think it was a mistake to call a document a constitution when it was primarily a co-ordinating treaty? In retrospect, that might have been a mistake in so far as it does not meet the conventional definitions of a constitution. It is a set of co-ordinating mechanisms for the existing treaties. On reflection, would it have been wiser to call it a co-ordinating treaty incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights?Has the Minister of State considered the differences in opinion between the French and Dutch rejections? I have suggested that the neo-liberal agenda is important in considering the French case, while the Dutch commentary on the "no" vote suggests the primary reason for rejection may have been the failure of the European Union to establish a bond with its citizens.Is the Minister of State convinced there will be a referendum in Britain, and will it influence the Government's thinking?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	162	To answer the last question first, it is a matter for each member state to decide how it may ratify the EU constitution. I cannot guess what the United Kingdom will do.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I think I can.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The United Kingdom will take up the EU presidency on 1 July and will clearly play a major part at the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June. We await the suggestions it will bring to the table regarding how we can move ahead. Ireland will take its own decision as a sovereign nation with its own Government and this Parliament. We will take our own decision in due course, based on what we believe is best for the country in the future.It is not for me to interpret the reasons for the rejection of the constitution in France or the Netherlands, though we greatly regret the outcome. I have been following the media reportage of the situation and clearly, a complex conclusion has been arrived at. People voted against the constitution for various reasons. Some had genuine reasons for voting against it because of their personal opinions. Others voted against it because of local domestic issues. The neo-liberal agenda, as perceived by some, was certainly one of the reasons some people voted against it.In hindsight, it is hard to say whether the EU constitution should have been called a consolidated treaty or otherwise. We are in the process of consolidating treaties. Some 95% of what is written into the constitution has already been ratified. The remainder, 5% of it, is new. In hindsight, we probably needed much more time to communicate with the citizens of Europe and all the member states. That message is loud and clear. There is a serious difficulty in communicating full information on the European initiative and mechanism to all the citizens on a consistent, regular basis. On the other hand, the communication is such that citizens are not seeking information unless it is made available to them.Europe must grapple with this issue. We must strengthen the "Communicating Europe" initiative and make much more information readily available. From all the research available, it is obvious that the more information is given to the citizens of our countries and Europe together, the more interest they have, the more positive they are and the more committed to embracing change. In hindsight, asking the citizens of Europe to enlarge the union by ten countries just one year ago, and then to bring in a new EU constitution just 12 months later, was perhaps asking a great deal. We now need a period of calm reflection and to see what will be the outcome of the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June. We can then work together in the interests of the common good of Ireland and Europe together.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I am concerned to hear the Minister of State saying that Ireland will make its own decision. I thought that Ireland had made its decision and that a referendum on the constitution was to be held. Does the Minister of State agree that it would be totally wrong that our attitude to the constitution should be dictated by the opinions of the French and Dutch people? Will the Minister of State give us a guarantee or assurance that a referendum will be held to give the people of Ireland the chance to say "yes" or "no" to the constitution? Will the Government give leadership on this matter? The Taoiseach should not follow public opinion but should try to lead it, and convince the people that the European Union and constitution mean peace, wealth and development for Ireland, and that many other issues, which have nothing at all to do with the constitution, should be put aside.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Allen. I thank him and his party, as I do Deputy Michael Higgins and his party for the powerful and solid support and endorsement they have given for the EU constitution over the past 12 months.I do not know where Deputy Allen got the idea that a decision had been made. Nobody said the decision was made. We have not made a decision. We have until November 2006 to make that decision.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The decision to hold a referendum has been made.

We have given clear answers. Since I took up my post on 30 September of last year, it was clear that a decision on a referendum would be made during the year ahead.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	169	A decision on the date is what the Minister of State said. The Government has published legislation for the referendum.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	170	We made a clear decision that we would proceed and it was on that basis that we published the legislation. However, we never said when that referendum would be held — we have not made that decision. I do not want anybody to be under the misapprehension that we made a decision on a date as we have not done so.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I said the Government has made a decision on a referendum.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Allow me to answer the questions. We have made no decision on a date. We have published the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and are working on a White Paper which will be brought forward as soon as it is available. There is no shortage of leadership from either the Taoiseach or the Government.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	176	There is a serious situation in Europe and I am confident that the leadership the Taoiseach gave during his period as President of the European Union and the leadership the Government gave while we held the Presidency will be carried through into the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June. After that we can go forward in the knowledge that we are all committed to achieving what is in the best interest of Ireland, namely, ratification of the European constitution as quickly as possible.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	177	So will we have a referendum?

What is unclear, however, is the matter of the referendum. I thought the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said there would be a referendum in Ireland and that they made that statement after the Dutch and French decisions. Will the Minister of State clarify that? I suggest it would be too much to express unanimity after the forthcoming Council meeting as some governments will want to hold a referendum, others will be less enthusiastic and some will be against it.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I heard the Minister of State say clearly that no decision was made about the referendum. I want him to give me a "yes" or "no" answer as to whether there will be a referendum in Ireland or whether the people will have an opportunity, after a period of reflection on the results of the French and Dutch referenda, to have their say. Will the Taoiseach lead on this issue rather than be led?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The Deputy may be assured we will lead on this issue, that we want the European constitution ratified, that the Taoiseach will make his position clear at the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 June and that we will proceed with the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which we published last week. If we were not committed to it, would we have published it? There is no doubt about it.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I did not ask about the legislation, I asked about a referendum.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	182	We published the legislation to enable us to have a referendum. One does not publish legislation unless one is committed to achieving a conclusion. That is the purpose of the legislation. We look forward to the Deputy's support and that of all our colleagues in the House in ensuring that we achieve the required goal on behalf of the people.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality, as followed by successive Governments, is fully respected and protected. The central and defining characteristics of policy in this area are our non-participation in military alliances and our commitment to the United Nations as the guarantor of international peace and security. Ireland's approach, embodied by this non-membership of military alliances, such as NATO or the WEU, continues to remain viable in the current security environment where the emerging defence and security challenges have moved away from traditional defence towards crisis management and dealing with threats from international terrorism.Successive Governments have made a political commitment not to join a military alliance without consulting the people first. This commitment was given concrete form in October 2002 when, at the same time as giving their approval for the Treaty of Nice, the Irish people backed a Government proposal to amend the Constitution so as to make it impossible for Ireland to take part in an EU defence without obtaining public approval in a further referendum. This constitutional ban on Ireland's participation in a common defence is carried over in the amendment published by the Government last week on ratification of the European constitution.The provisions of the European constitution in the security and defence area are fully consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. We will not assume any binding mutual defence commitment. Where the European constitution provides for mutual assistance, Ireland will determine its own response in conformity with our traditional approach of military neutrality.The Government also takes the view that military neutrality on its own is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally and that it is also desirable to play an active and constructive role internationally. Through the United Nations, and now through regional organisations such as the European Union, Ireland has sought to play a proactive role in preventing and managing conflicts and maintaining peace throughout the world.The Government will continue to uphold Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. Ireland will not join a military alliance, but will remain fully and actively engaged in the pursuit of international peace and security, both through the United Nations and the European Union.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	With regard to militarisation, is the Minister of State aware that the majority of our citizens are totally opposed to the idea of a European superstate that could become more centralised and more militarised? What is the Minister of State's response to the recent remarks of EU Ambassador to the United States, John Bruton, that the EU constitution would help the European Union become a more effective partner of the United States? What did Mr. Bruton mean by this? Does the Minister of State agree that Ireland should pursue its security concerns within the OSCE and the reformed United Nations rather than through the European Union as he stated?Should Ireland seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation and therefore oppose the militarisation of the European Union? I urge the Minister of State to refuse to co-operate with or condone policies or military groupings that maintain nuclear weapons. Does he not see a contradiction in complaining regularly in this House about Sellafield and how dangerous it is for Ireland while at the same time getting closer to nuclear powers in the European Union? Does he agree that many citizens feel we are moving in that direction and that the Government is basically joining this group by stealth?The debate on the European constitution could fall or stand on this issue. The people want to play a part in the United Nations, but not in any other alliances. Will the Minister of State accept that there is widespread concern among many of our citizens on this issue?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	186	There is no reason for this widespread concern as there is no proposal to have a military superstate in the European Union. With regard to the nuclear situation, we are no closer to any nuclear power in Europe today than we were in 1972 when our people ratified our membership of the European Union, which included the EURATOM Treaty. That treaty has not been amended since. It is part of the European constitution, it has been in existence since the 1950s and still stands without change.It is alarming to talk about a military superpower. The Deputy referred to what ambassador John Bruton said about the European constitution. It is not for me to interpret what he said but the basic meaning is that once the European Union has ratified its constitution, it will be in a better position to make a contribution to conflict resolution, reducing poverty and assisting crisis management in various parts of the world, whether in cross-border situations vis-à-vis drugs, trafficking in humans or whatever. It will balance the contribution of the United States and ensure that it is not a lone power making a contribution in this field.As a result of the new constitution which will be ratified in due course, the European Union will be in a better position to make a more professional, focused and quicker contribution to conflict resolution and the resolution of other tragedies that have bedevilled mankind for centuries. In the past, people stood idly by and were not able to do anything, even within Europe. We have a moral and political responsibility to ensure we do not stand idly by in the future and allow innocent people be the victims of such situations.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	187	This is a typical example of the attitude to people like me who question the remit of the United Nations. There is no question of us wanting to stand idly by. We want to use our resources, through the United Nations, and have radical reforms and priorities. That is the issue. We respect the United Nations and many of our people have given their lives to it. That is not sitting on the fence. One of the reasons the people do not trust the Government is that they think it is joining a military alliance or moving towards militarisation by stealth. The Government is not facing up to that.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	188	As I said in response to Question No. 2, Ireland's position has been absolutely clear since the Government clarified this country's position on neutrality during the campaign that preceded the second referendum on the Nice treaty. Ireland cannot become involved in any military activity without meeting the terms of the triple lock system — a request for such participation has to be received from the UN, a decision has to be made by the sovereign Government of the people of Ireland and that decision has to be ratified by the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland. That position, which is in the proposed EU constitution, is internationally respected. There is no threat to Ireland's position.Question No. 4 answered with QuestionNo. 2.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for expenditure on official development assistance. The issues of how best to meet the target and in what timeframe is under ongoing review. Ireland and the other EU member states agreed last week to reach an interim target of 0.51% by 2010 and to reach the 0.7% target by 2015. I have stated publicly that I hope Ireland will be ahead of the terms of the new EU commitment, by reaching the UN target of 0.7% before 2015.The recently produced information pack on Development Co-operation Ireland was designed to give an overview of the work of Ireland's official development programme. The pack, which shows how the money of Irish taxpayers is being spent in some of the world's poorest countries, is a general information guide that introduces people to the work of Development Co-operation Ireland. It has been circulated at a number of recent public meetings, which were convened in various parts of the country as part of the preparation of the White Paper on development co-operation policy. I intend to ensure that the pack is updated at regular intervals as part of the Government's ongoing efforts to keep the public informed about what it is doing in this important area.It has been clear at the seven public meetings which have been held throughout the country that there is a strong public appetite for more information about the work of Development Co-operation Ireland. The information pack and a variety of other public information initiatives are designed to bridge the knowledge gap and increase understanding about the Government's development assistance work. When decisions have been taken about how best to meet the target and in what timeframe, such matters will be reflected in subsequent editions of the information pack.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I would like to elaborate explicitly on my initial question. The information pack produced as an introduction to the work of Development Co-operation Ireland is attractive and colourful. Neither the substantial pack nor the handy guide that accompanies it contains a reference to a target of allocating 0.7% of GNP or GNI by any given year. The pack refers to the UN target of 0.15% of aid being allocated to the poorest nations of the world, however. Ireland has achieved that target by giving most of its aid to sub-Saharan Africa. I accept that the poorest nations in that region deserve our attention.I will repeat the explicit question I originally asked. Why has the Department of Foreign Affairs produced an information pack about the work of Development Co-operation Ireland without referring to the most solemn commitment on overseas development aid that has ever been offered to the international community? The commitment was given by the Taoiseach at the UN in September 2000 and was repeated in the manifestos of each of the Government parties at the last general election. The Taoiseach told me last week that the social partners have signed up to the commitment. Why was it not mentioned in the information pack? Why has an attempt been made in the pack to draw attention to the 0.15% commitment? It seems to be a type of subterfuge.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I welcome the Deputy's question. There is no element of subterfuge in the information pack. I indicated in an up-front and honest manner, within a month of being appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, that the Government could not achieve its target of spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas development aid by 2007.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Yes.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I did not consider it necessary to mention the target in the information booklet because I am involved in the final stages of a complex set of discussions with the Minister for Finance and others. The discussions, which relate to the determining of a new realistic and achievable timeframe within which the 0.7% target can be met, should be finished within the next month. As I said in response to questions from other Deputies, I hope Ireland can achieve the 0.7% target before 2015, which is the EU's deadline for the achievement of the target.The 0.15% target was mentioned in the information pack because it is very interesting. While one often hears people talking about the 0.7% target, one rarely encounters a reference to the 0.15% target. Those who are knowledgeable about development matters believe that the 0.15% target is much more important in substantive terms. That Ireland has achieved the 0.15% target proves that its aid programme is very effective. Ireland received a great deal of praise in a peer group review that was conducted by the OECD in 2003.Ireland's aid programme is well regarded internationally because half of its expenditure in the developing world is spent on the least developed countries on earth, which are found in sub-Saharan Africa. Some non-governmental agencies consider Ireland's overseas aid programme to be the best in the world. The 0.15% target was mentioned in the information booklet because Ireland is one of just six countries to have exceeded it. It is quite an important figure because it is an indicator of success in poverty reduction, which has been at the centre of Deputy Michael Higgins's political thinking throughout his career. I am rather bemused and quizzical because the Deputy has questioned the validity of the reference to the 0.15% target. As a lifelong socialist, the Deputy has dedicated himself to the cause of reducing poverty, domestically and internationally.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I do not query the reference in the information pack to the achievement of the 0.15% target. It is extraordinary, however, that the booklet does not contain a simple sentence saying that the Government will announce shortly the year in which it proposes to achieve the UN target of 0.7%.I am afraid that the international concentration on the poorest countries in the world, which are in sub-Saharan Africa, is not working in the manner suggested by the Minister of State. Some 227 million people in the region were living on $1 each per day in 1990, but that had increased to 313 million people by 2001. The average income of a person in the 33 countries of sub-Saharan Africa is $270 per year, or 71 cent per day. Ireland could have made a great impact on the lives of such people by spending all the money needed to achieve the 0.7% target in sub-Saharan Africa. We could have spent such money on the HIV-AIDS world millennium development goal project, for example.It has been suggested at some of the meetings throughout the country that Ireland might not have been able to spend 0.7% of GNP if the Government had achieved that target. That suggestion does not contain an ounce of sense, however. If one is producing a booklet outlining the work of Development Co-operation Ireland in the knowledge that the 0.7% target will not be met by 2007, one should have the honour to state in the booklet that the matter is under discussion and the new target year will be announced shortly.

That Ireland's target date for the achievement of the 0.7% goal is under discussion has been mentioned at every meeting that has been held as part of the White Paper consultation process. The re-evaluation of the 0.7% target was not mentioned in the information booklet, but it will be mentioned in the next booklet, which will be produced in January 2006. A new strategy for the achievement of the 0.7% target, including a new timeframe, will be in place by then. I will be delighted to give Deputy Michael D, Higgins a copy of the next booklet when it has been completed. It is important to reflect on the Deputy's comments about the decline in the allocation of overseas aid to sub-Saharan Africa by other countries over the past ten or 20 years.

The Irish aid programme has been going in the opposite direction.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I accept that.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	199	It has increased threefold since 1997. Ireland has led the way in development assistance, in many ways, over recent years. There has been a decline in the level of EU funding to sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest part of the world, in the past 20 years. The exact opposite has been the case in respect of the Irish programme, which is something we can take pride in on a cross-party basis. Ministers of State from the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and other parties have developed the Irish aid programme, which is the best development programme in the world, according to the OECD peer review group. That finding has been supported by independent non-governmental organisations over the past two weeks.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 33 and 78 together.I refer the Deputies to my answer to Question No. 1.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The Minister of State said earlier that his Department was in discussions with the Department of Finance regarding future aid. He indicated that he will be announcing the new target before the end of the year. I am sure he will publish a nice glossy brochure again next year. Will he agree that the cynics among us would say the announcement of a new target before the United Nations summit meeting will be seen as providing a figleaf to the Taoiseach when he returns to the scene of his crime in New York where he made the original commitment to0.7%? Will the Minister of State assure me that any new target will be adhered to?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	202	If the Deputy followed my progress since I took up office, he will see that I have been very clear on this matter. We must set a realistic and achievable timeframe on this occasion. We must plan properly how to achieve this target and an achievable timeframe must be set. I agree with the Deputy that it would be dangerous to set an earlier target date that might not be achievable. This would have a damaging impact on the long-term public support for development assistance. It is important in this historic year for development generally precisely because we have this summit in September that noteworthy people such as musicians like Bono and Bob Geldof are doing very good work trying in an idealistic manner to urge people to increase their contribution. The contribution needs to be increased outside the European Union.It is interesting that the targets set at the meeting in Brussels, including the interim target for 2010, will bring an additional €20 billion into the development field, which is very important. It means there will be an extra €20 billion to deal with the three diseases to which Deputy Higgins referred, namely, tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. Some €20 billion extra will come into the development aid pool because of the decision taken in Brussels last Monday. I am proud we led the way in that regard. We must be careful about the targets we set. However, we should not forget that the Estimates package I achieved in the last budget was the largest ever in the history of the State. Some €1.8 billion will be spent over the next two years. This represents an increase of €190 million, €70 million this year, €65 million next year and €65 million the following year. This is an extraordinary achievement on which I hope to build.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Question No. 33 refers to the Taoiseach's remarks in reply to a statement made by Bob Geldof. Mr. Geldof has continually stressed the connection between aid, trade and debt. In the case of Zambia, for example, one of the requirements of the International Monetary Fund for Zambia was that it would privatise the Zambian bank, which had many small depositors. The Zambian Government said "No" and it had €1 billion removed from its debt relief. None of the countries we discussed this afternoon has a life expectancy of 50 years. It is 32.5 years or 33 years in Zambia. Some €1 billion in debt relief was taken from a country with a life expectancy of 33 years.In regard to the points made, it is important that we make our commitment to the 0.7% contribution. In case we lose the run of ourselves, the Minister of State referred to the UN millennium development goals. They would require aid to increase from €121 billion in 2006 to €189 billion in 2015. How will this happen all over the world if we do not meet our 0.7% commitment because we have been growing too quickly? The Taoiseach's position appears to be that we became too rich to meet our commitment. His view is that if the economy went into decline, we would be able to reach the 0.7% commitment more quickly.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The Deputy may be misquoting the Taoiseach's response to Bob Geldof's statement on the African commission. He is correct that there is a significant link between trade, debt and aid. One cannot isolate one to the detriment of the others. It is hoped this year not just to get the volume of increases required to meet the extraordinary figure the Deputy mentioned by 2015 but also to make tangible progress towards achieving this. We are providing an extra €20 billion at European level because of the decision on the interim target of 0.51% by 2010, which is good news. This is why Ireland took such a strong role within the Council of Ministers to have these targets set down for the 15 old member states and the ten new member states who went for a lower figure. This was done to send a strong signal to other countries outside the European Union, but in the OECD, who are not prepared to match the commitment Ireland and other European countries have made. It was set to act as a pressure point on other countries to come to the mark and make similar commitments to achieve the figure by 2015. Most people in the development community welcomed the announcement in Brussels for that reason. To borrow a French phrase, Pour encourager les autres.

Therefore, to talk about an additional €180 million is playing with figures.Have any credible development organisations agreed that the EU target of 0.7% by 2015 is acceptable? What feedback did the Minister of State receive in terms of the Government reneging on the 2007 commitment during the public consultation process? Has the issue been raised with him?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I thank the Deputy for attending the public consultation process in the Helix. He was the only Deputy from the Dublin area to do so, for which I thank him. We are currently on the figure of 0.41% of GNP, which is a higher figure than he perhaps thought.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	208	It is 0.39% really.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The current figure is 0.41%. However, the figures will be subject to revision when we see the full end of year outturn, but this is the figure which is available at the moment.On the question of the 2015 date, the UN said that developed countries like Ireland should achieve the 0.7% figure by 2015. The EU has committed to that figure. I hope that commitment will be reaffirmed by the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the European Council in the next month or so.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The Minister of State has jumped eight years.

This would be a positive signal as we push into the remainder of the year which will involve the millennium development summit. Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred earlier to the important issue of trade matters. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Michael Ahern, and I will travel to Hong Kong in December for the conclusion of the Doha round negotiations. Our intention is to make it the development round of the talks. We want to ensure a good result from a development point of view so the trade deal is of significant assistance. Developing countries are likely to gain seven times more from a trade concession than from an aid concession from developed countries. That should also be the focus of our efforts in the months ahead.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Is the Minister of State satisfied overseas development aid funding filters down to the most needy in Third World countries? Is the Department generating value for money in the projects? Many members of the public are concerned that the money does not always go to the most needy. With regard to the consultative process, what is the general reaction of NGOs and others interested in this issue? Has the issue of the 0.7% target been raised at the public meetings? Are people satisfied with the target date of 2015?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I do not wish to misrepresent the comments of people at the meeting and my comments will be subjective. However, the discussions have been involved. Deputy Ó Snodaigh attended the public meeting at the Helix and he may enlighten the Deputy further on it. He may be more independent because he is not a Government Member. The 0.7% issue has been raised and it is clear it is passionately held that this target should be met by people interested in development aid. Two thirds of the audience at the meetings has been dominated by NGO representatives and Fairtrade groupings while the balance comprises ordinary citizens with a strong interest in this area. The discussions have been interesting for that reason and it has been a genuine listening exercise.Concerns have been raised about whether the money is reaching its intended target and filtering down to the poorest of the poor. Other issues raised include respect for human rights, respect for proper governance and corruption. It is difficult to explain to people that 80% of our assistance is provided government to government in programme countries. Our programme was been well evaluated over the years both in value for money and the efficacy of spending. Thankfully, our aid programme has not been the subject of corruption involving the funds advanced to countries. The reason for that is our funding is ring-fenced and devoted to sectors such as health and education and it is tracked appropriately to ensure it is used for the development of these sectors. Our programme has produced spectacular successes. For instance, in Tanzania, over a three-year period, primary school attendance increased by up to 15%, which is extraordinary.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Our programme has resulted in enormous successes, which I hope to share with Members in the next few months in a supplementary package similar to that described by Deputy Michael Higgins. It will explain what is being achieved through the programme. It is important that this knowledge should be shared with the public.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 9 together.Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, immigration has become a highly sensitive and divisive issue in the United States. The Bill recently published by Senators Kennedy and McCain and their colleagues, represents an important, timely and positive contribution to advancing the debate on this sensitive issue and it is warmly welcomed by the Government. Among the provisions in the Bill are proposals that would grant undocumented people an opportunity to regularise their status.As with all legislative proposals in the US, the Kennedy-McCain initiative must be considered in detail by Congress. We can anticipate a vigorous debate in the period ahead on this and other proposed immigration measures but the clear and constructive proposals put forward by Senators Kennedy and McCain will stimulate a debate, which we hope will be fruitful and lead to a positive outcome.The Deputies can be assured that the issues of our undocumented citizens and immigration reform have the highest priority for the Government. The Taoiseach and the Minister raised the issue of the undocumented, as well as the issue of wider immigration reform, with President Bush when they met with him on St. Patrick's Day and also on Capitol Hill at that time. President Bush re-affirmed his willingness to work with Congress on immigration reform. Our priority in the period ahead will be to lobby strongly in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill and to encourage the White House to become involved in support of the reform process.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	217	When the Taoiseach met President Bush, one of the difficulties was he could not state how many undocumented or out of status Irish were in the US. As the Taoiseach stated, estimates vary. I wish the Kennedy-McCain initiative Bill well. Is the REAL ID programme not a more imminent danger to out of status Irish? Irish people will not be able to obtain a driver's licence, which will prevent them from driving to work. This programme is in place in New York. President Bush estimated the number of illegal Irish in the US at 3,000 while the Taoiseach's ball park figures ranged between 20,000 and 50,000. If the REAL ID programme is implemented, it will create deep distress for out of status Irish.The reaction of the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to immigrants entering Ireland who are out of status is not encouraging for those who would like help to be given to the illegal Irish in the US. We would like consistency. The scale of the problem is much lower in Ireland but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's comments are appalling given that, at the same time, the Government is appealing to the US for more generosity.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	218	It is not easy to arrive at an exact figure because travel options mean people can come and go from the US to Ireland and elsewhere. The UNHCR has praised Ireland's immigration policies.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he regards the procedures as a burden. He made a disgraceful remark about international law; it was scandalous. He said he would like to deal with cock and bull stories of immigrants at the airport. No Minister in the civilised world has said anything like that in recent times.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	220	It is important that this issue should be approached in a consistent and uniform way, irrespective of whether that is in Ireland or the US.The Deputy referred to the legislation known as REAL ID, which was signed into law in the US on 11 May. States have three years to introduce its provisions. Since the tragedy of 11 September, immigration has been a sensitive issue in the US. This Act, which was prompted in part by the report of the 9-11 Commission, establishes minimum standards for state issued driver licences and identity cards so that they can be eligible for use as federal identification. The impact of the new legislation cannot be foreseen but it could have an impact on undocumented Irish people for whom a driving licence is their main form of identity. However, we are hopeful that proposals that offer undocumented people a path to legalisation such as those brought forward by Senators Kennedy and McCain will be adopted.Representatives of all political parties recently attended the conference on immigration in the US where the attitude of the US was made clear, as were the efforts being made by official Ireland on behalf of our people. Representations have been made at all levels, including the meetings at Dromoland Castle last autumn and the White House on 17 March. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs raise this issue at every opportunity on behalf of our people. They will continue to do so and we hope the proposed legislation will go a long way towards resolving the problems faced by our people in the US.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I pay tribute to the people from the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties who travelled at their own expense. As the House knows, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will travel on Monday, 6 June. I also pay tribute to the work done to encourage production of this legislation. I support fully the provisions of the Bill as published by Kennedy-McCain. Has the Minister of State identified the points of opposition the Bill will face due to the influx of people, mainly the large number of illegal immigrants from Mexico? Has the Government worked to address those areas of opposition? Can the Minister of State offer any advice to the committee members going out next week about what they can do to convince those conservative elements that see any such Bill as a general amnesty to all illegal immigrants?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	222	It was made clear to our representatives at the conference in the United States that the word "amnesty" is not one that should be used in this context. There are up to 10 million undocumented people in the United States, presenting a great difficulty for that country's Administration. Officials at our consulates and embassies around the US are maintaining close contacts with various figures in the US Administration and legislature in respect of all possible avenues towards achieving positive conclusions to immigration reform.Increasingly, immigrants in the US originate from countries in the Americas and Asia. In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how a proposal designed to cater for Irish interests alone could gather sufficient consensus in Congress to be accepted. In this context, we must support measures for immigration reform that would benefit undocumented people in general, including the Irish. There is much good will and respect for Irish people at every level within the US. We will work together to achieve progress and are optimistic that this can be done.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Is the Minister of State aware of Titles VI and VII of the legislation? Title VI promotes family unity and would reduce backlogs. Title VII would provide a mechanism by which the status of eligible undocumented immigrants in the US on the date of the Bill's introduction can be adjusted to temporary non-immigrant status. Does the Minister of State support the Bill and these two provisions in particular? In light of his earlier answer concerning the need for consistency in terms of these issues in Ireland, would he support the introduction of similar provisions to promote family unity among immigrants and to provide a mechanism whereby eligible undocumented immigrants are given the facility to adjust their status here? If the Minister of State believes in consistency, will he ensure there is some between the American Bill and what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been trying to implement?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I do not understand why the Deputy would ask a question pertaining to whether I support this US Bill. I support it, as do our diplomats, ambassadors, consulates, Government and Irish Americans. We are working through all of those avenues to achieve a positive conclusion to the matter. We will leave no stone unturned in assisting the Bill's development, taking into account that this must be an inclusive Bill as otherwise it would not work. There are 10 million undocumented people in the US, which highlights the challenges, complexities and difficulties. There is no comparison between the situations here and that in the Unites States vis-à-vis our undocumented people.

If one were to speak with any member of the immigration staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are dealing with this matter here, one would learn about the difficulties they experience in identifying people and getting information or documentation. There is non-co-operation with their requests for information.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Will the Minister of State elaborate on the proposed idea for an on-line database for illegal Irish immigrants living in the USA, to gain an accurate picture of how many such persons there are? As the Minister of State knows, the estimates vary. The US Government estimates 3,000 while we estimate between 20,000 and 50,000. What is the exact figure? Could there be potential difficulties with this idea, in that people do not wish to put forward their names because they are illegal? Is there a problem that perhaps could be solved if they remained anonymous, but then we would not get the accurate data?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Deputy Gormley's conclusion is correct. We have examined this issue in great detail. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had a positive discussion on immigration reform with President Bush on Saint Patrick's Day and prior to that in Dromoland Castle. Following this, the Minister asked his officials to again consider ways of getting a more precise sense of the size of our undocumented population, including the possibility of setting up an on-line database for this purpose. However, the widespread view after much consultation was that our undocumented people would be unlikely to register on a database for the reasons the Deputy suggested. This is understandable and, under these circumstances, it has been decided not to go ahead with the approach.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I welcome the Kennedy-McCain Bill, which is a positive and constructive initiative. Does the Minister of State agree that it is for all parliamentarians and Members of the Dáil to support Irish immigrants? Does he accept that the Government has a brass neck in calling for support for Irish emigrants while deporting 110 immigrants from Ireland in recent months? I strongly support Deputy Michael Higgins's comments about how some of our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's remarks were out of order and disgraceful.Does the Minister of State accept that, as political leaders, we have a duty to lead in the immigration issue? Even if doing so loses votes, it is essential that we lead. Does he support the proposal put forward by many Deputies to extend the franchise, allowing Irish emigrants to vote in our elections? Will the Government reconsider the situation of some immigrant families in Ireland? A group of Kurds living in Marino, have family in a refugee camp in Iraq. They have been trying to get their family together for the past six months. I have been pushing their case but all sorts of doors have been slammed in my face. If the Government is serious about the immigration issue, we must accept out international obligations as a sovereign state to assist immigrants all over the world.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I asked the Minister of State an additional question about the current estimates for illegal immigrants. What is the Government's present estimate and how did it arrive at this figure?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I do not have a de facto figure. From our consultations with the United States, there are at least 3,000 Irish immigrants there. From other estimates made, the figure could be 20,000 and is certainly not more than 50,000. We are not sure, which is a serious difficulty. We know there has been much mobility of Irish immigrants into and out of the US through other countries, sometimes to return to Ireland and sometimes to leave again. We are not sure of the final destinations in certain cases. Hence, it is difficult to have a final figure.In response to Deputy McGrath, it is unfair to say that the Government has a brass neck in the situation. In the 23 years that I have been in this House the elected Members have always been supportive and have assisted our people in all parts of the world, no matter what the situation. There is a unity of purpose there.If one examines the situation last May, when new members joined the European Union, Ireland was the only country to give an absolute guarantee that anybody from an EU country could come to work here. Everybody said that was a crazy decision, that the floodgates would open——

When it comes to the situation pertaining to citizens of our country and citizens of the European Union, we are all one. We have that commonality, there are equal rights in that situation and we have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that where we require workers, priority is given to people in the EU.Non-EU citizens have come here for a number of reasons. Some are economic migrants, others seek their human rights or are fleeing tragedies in their countries and so on. People have come here but we must be measured and reasonable. In a small island and open country we must ensure that we have a system that is equitable, fair, systematic, clear and properly administered and that nobody can get through the system easily and cause problems for the country. We must be very careful that we are reasoned and measured in our actions. We all have a duty, as parliamentarians, to have a unity of purpose in discharging our responsibilities and ensuring that, together, we manage what is a difficult, complex and humane situation. All of us have that serious responsibility.

It was a very slight speech so it will not take the Minister of State very long to comment on it. It is extraordinary because it is of a very low standard. I hope that I do not get someone into trouble by saying that. However, it is not up to the usual standards of Iveagh House. Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote it himself.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 74, 84 and 101 together.Deputies will be aware that preparations are well advanced for the summit that will take place at the United Nations next September at which Heads of State and Government will seek to restore momentum to the achievement of the millennium development goals; agree on reforms that will strengthen the system of collective security, based on the United Nations; enhance the human rights function of the United Nations; and reform its institutions and management structures. It is a priority for the Government to do whatever it can to promote the success of the summit.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was honoured to be appointed by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, as one of five envoys to act on his behalf in encouraging governments to take the decisions necessary to ensure a satisfactory outcome at the September summit. The appointment is an indication of the esteem in which Ireland is held by the Secretary General and of its track record of commitment to the United Nations. As UN envoy, the task of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is to make the case for the broad package of recommendations and reforms set out in the UN Secretary General's recent report, In Larger Freedom.The Minister was asked by the Secretary General to focus his efforts on Europe. However, none of the envoys is confined in his or her activities to any one geographic area and the Minister has recently undertaken a number of bilateral meetings, as envoy, with colleagues from a range of Latin American and Arab states.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The work of the envoys is vital to the preparatory process as it is evident that success in September will require governments to step back from hitherto entrenched positions and take decisions in the wider interest of all members and the multilateral system that serves them. The work that the envoys are carrying out with governments is intended to complement the dialogue and debate in which members' delegations in New York are engaged, under the guidance of the president of the General Assembly.The Minister for Foreign Affairs commenced his series of envoy visits shortly after his appointment by the Secretary General on 4 April and his subsequent briefing of his EU colleagues at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers held on 15 and 16 April. He has subsequently met a number of Foreign Ministers, including those from within the European Union, as well as high representative Javier Solana and external relations Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. The Minister gave an updated briefing to partners at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 23 May.To date, the Minister has travelled to capitals to meet his counterparts from Belgium, Italy, San Marino, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, Austria and Spain. In his capacity as envoy, the Minister addressed the Council of Europe summit, held in Warsaw on 16 and 17 May. On 18 May, he met the President and Foreign Minister of Poland. He also took the opportunity to confer with the Foreign Ministers of Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Liechtenstein. He further conferred with his fellow envoy, President Vike Freiberga of Latvia. The Minister also, on 17 May, gave the opening statement at the meeting of the foreign policy club at the Centre for International Relations in Warsaw.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	He is very busy. In his statement, the Minister set out the case for the reforms necessary to ensure that the United Nations is able to act effectively in the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion of human rights and the promotion of economic and social progress. The Minister, as envoy, addressed the meeting of the Euro-Atlantic partnership council, hosted by Sweden in Åre, on 24 May. At the council meeting, he took the opportunity to meet the Foreign Ministers of Sweden, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as the US Undersecretary of State, Mr. Burns.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The European Union held an extensive and substantive discussion with its Latin American partners on the preparations for the September summit at the EU Rio group meeting held on 27 May. At the invitation of the Presidency, the Minister briefed the meeting on his role as envoy and discussed the prospects of and priorities for a successful outcome from the summit. The Minister also had interesting and useful meetings with his Argentinian and Chilean colleagues, at which they discussed UN reform.The European Union also discussed UN reform and the September summit with its Mediterranean partners at the seventh Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting on 30 May. The Minister discussed the preparation of the summit in bilateral meetings with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Algeria, Syria and the Palestinian Authority. Yesterday in New York, the Minister had meetings with the UN Secretary General, the president of the General Assembly and the other envoys where they took stock of the current situation and discussed the preparation of the summit. The president of the General Assembly is expected to publish proposals in the coming days which will form the basis for future consideration by the member states.I am not in a position to comment on the contents of the Minister's meetings with his Foreign Minister colleagues. He has undertaken to convey the views expressed in his meetings to the UN Secretary General in strict confidence. The effectiveness of his mission and that of the other envoys demands that the exchanges remain confidential. I confirm that the meetings to date have been productive, informative and of value to the Secretary General and his support team.Regarding the current position on UN reform, discussions are continuing at the United Nations on the recommendations contained in the Secretary General's In Larger Freedom report. Ireland and its European Union partners continue to press for the adoption of a positive and balanced package of measures at the September summit.

Obviously the Minister for Foreign Affairs is casting his net wide. However, I referred to his speech in Warsaw, which includes the following statement:International law has long recognised the right of states to take action to pre-empt an imminent attack. Preventive action against a potential threat, however, should remain a matter for the Security Council.Therefore, what the Minister had to say on Iraq was misleading. Article 51 of the UN Charter enables a country to defend itself, to pre-empt attack that is imminent, but it must respond with reasonable force. In fairness to the Government, I understand that it was against the principle of pre-emptive strikes which led to the fundamental illegality of the strike against Iraq with its appalling consequences which are still obvious today.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I welcome what Deputy Higgins has said. He is correct in his interpretation of the Government's position. While the Minister for Foreign Affairs may have cast his net wide from an international perspective, he has been asked to do so on behalf of the United Nations. That indicates an excellent attitude on our part and it also shows that Ireland is held in great regard by the UN. The Minister is doing his utmost, as a Member of this Parliament and a member of the Government, to make a unique contribution to the continued evolution and development and modernisation of the United Nations at a critical time in the history of mankind.Written answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of the termination of the employment of Mr. K. Maha Lingam, orthopaedic surgeon, by the management of Cork University Hospital from a position he held for 11 years. His employment was terminated on the grounds that the Department of Health and Children failed to sanction an additional post which would have allowed him to continue in his position as orthopaedic surgeon in the hospital.It is utterly unacceptable that elderly people with orthopaedic problems are told that they cannot be put on the outpatient waiting list and, when they are eventually put on the list, that they can expect to wait for up to two years for an examination. I know elderly people who have come to my clinic in tears because of pain and have been told that they may have to wait years for an examination. They have also been told that if they have €4,000 or, sometimes, €6,000, they can receive treatment within weeks from the same surgeons in the same hospital. This is scandalous and, despite the Tánaiste being aware of it, it has been allowed to continue. That medical apartheid must be dealt with sooner rather than later if social justice is to exist.The public waiting lists at that hospital are unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue at their present level. No matter how unacceptable they are, I find it incredible that Mr. Maha Lingam's position as trauma surgeon has been terminated with effect from 31 May 2005. Records available to me for St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, the associated hospital of Cork University Hospital, for the years 1994-2001 show that Mr. Lingam carried out 30% of all hip replacements and over 30% of knee replacements in that orthopaedic unit, which had six orthopaedic surgeons. The figures are only available up to 2001 because I am informed that in that year, theatre space in the hospital was no longer made available to Mr. Lingam, despite the fact that theatre sessions were free for three years from 2002.My attempt, as a member of the former Southern Health Board, to get a breakdown of the level of public and private practice on a consultant-by-consultant basis in that hospital was refused by the management at the behest of some people who had a vested interest in what I would term a very lucrative business. I submitted a freedom of information request, which was turned down. My appeal was refused and I made a detailed appeal to the Information Commissioner, which was not dealt with for over three years. Subsequently, I withdrew the request because the case was not being dealt with.I find it incredible that, as a member of the former Southern Health Board, I could not get information from that health board about what was happening in hospitals funded by taxpayers. If the Minister is serious about dealing with some of the issues in the health services, that issue should be dealt with quickly and effectively.Very little spinal surgery and cruciate ligament work and little, if any, shoulder replacements have been carried out at Cork University Hospital since 2001. I have been told that there have been ongoing difficulties with orthopaedic services in Cork for quite some time, which have resulted in this unacceptable situation regarding waiting lists. I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to carry out an independent inquiry into the activities at Cork University Hospital and to immediately sanction the surgical position so that Mr. Maha Lingam can continue his work within the greater Cork area. His reputation in Cork is top class and he enjoys the confidence and support of his patients, past and present.This is not a party political issue. I regret the Tánaiste is not here. In the interests of justice for people who cannot help themselves and are at the mercy of those who make decisions about their future, this matter should be looked into and there should be a full and independent inquiry into what is happening.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by Deputy Allen to clarify, on behalf of the Tánaiste, who is unavoidably absent, the position of the Department of Health and Children. The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of acute hospital services and the appointment of new or replacement consultant posts.With regard to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, the former Southern Health Board made application for financial clearance to the Department of Health and Children for the appointment of a seventh consultant orthopaedic surgeon post. In view of the financial implications of the proposed post, the Department of Health and Children was not in a position to allocate funding for this post in 2004 nor in the letter of determination for 2005 which issued to the Southern Health Board in early December 2004.Since the establishment of the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and Children no longer has a role in the approval or funding arrangements for individual consultant posts. The Department has been informed that this case is the subject of ongoing litigation, including an appeal to the Supreme Court. Therefore, it is not appropriate to comment on the case.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. The people of Erris are extremely frightened because a high pressure pipeline is being forced upon them with no independent assessment of the risks. This pipeline will pass by their doors. I ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to immediately call a halt to this project, to defer giving permission to Shell to proceed and to insist on the construction of an off-shore terminal for the sake of the residents and the economic benefit of the area.Only today we hear that Sruwaddacon Bay is contaminated with black peat as a direct result of the preparation works at Bellanaboy for the in-shore terminal. Some 450,000 cu m of peat from the bog there is being transported to a Bord na Móna deposition site at Shramore, 11 km away. Already, the 800 truck movements per day have resulted in several trucks leaving the road and a local grotto has been damaged by the truck movements. Two days ago, the North Western Fisheries Board manager, Vincent Roche, warned that he would take legal action if discharges of silt into the Bellanaboy river continues. This river is a tributary of the Carramore lake, which supplies water to the entire region.This threat has been well flagged in the planning stage and the settlement pond system intended to prevent the silt from escaping is not working. On page 56 of the report by An Bord Pleanála, it is stated that if the settlement pond system did not work, Carramore Lake, the main water supply for the region, would be turned into a giant settlement pond.I have repeatedly queried in the Dáil the independence of the risk assessments that have been carried out on the terminal pipeline. The so-called independent curae or qualitative risk assessment was carried out in 2001 by J. P. Kenny on behalf of the original developer, Enterprise Energy Ireland. Mr. Kenny had worked on the original design brief on the pipeline. Mr. Andrew Johnson's subsequent study was a desk study based on this already flawed information. The biggest blow, however, was that the so-called independent consultant hired earlier this year by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to review the safety of the pipeline was far from independent. The company in question, British Pipeline Agency, is jointly owned by BP and Shell UK, the companies that put forward the project. Why was the Minister not aware of this information, which is available on the Internet? This company was founded in 1969 as a joint venture between BP Oil UK and Shell UK.One local resident who is familiar with fire hydrants says the ten bar pressure produced by a fire hydrant would pin a man against a wall at 50 yards, yet the pipeline is designed for 345 bar pressure — it will be 150 bar pressure initially. This man and his family must live beside this pipeline and he is very frightened by this prospect.I asked the Minister to release the curae earlier this year and I am glad he did so. However, the local people are very afraid for their health and safety. I said I would not live beside such a pipeline and I asked the Minister whether he would, but I did not get an answer. It is clear that nobody would live beside such a pipeline.The oil companies say they will not opt for an off-shore platform for economic reasons and to protect the health and safety of the people working there. However, they can write off the cost of their off-shore platform under the very generous 1992 tax deals done by the Government.Regarding health and safety matters, those who work on the rig choose to do so, but the people of the Erris area do not have a choice. They have to live beside this pipeline, a project which is being imposed on them and will do very little for the area. Very few jobs have been created and in many case, the jobs have been taken by people outside the area. The Minister should realise that the health and safety of the people are his responsibility and he should honour his responsibility by putting the health and safety of the people first. He should not collude in the pollution of the entire area, which is happening. The water supply to an entire region is being threatened. I appeal to the Minister to act now and to refuse all consents to Shell. He must insist on an offshore terminal or leave the gas there until such time as there is something in it for Mayo. At present, all Mayo gets from it is serious risk to the residents, whose lives are in peril, and the pollution of the area.I urge the Minister to stop this pipeline and refuse to give consents. There must be an offshore terminal for the sake of the area.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	276	In the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I will update the House on the review of the Corrib gas field developers' quantified risk assessment, QRA, for the onshore pipeline.The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources awarded the contract after a tendering process. Tenders for the QRA review were invited from four companies with the requisite competencies. One declined because it had worked on the Corrib gas field project previously. Two others declined, due to the unavailability of the consultant during the timeframe within which the work to be carried out was scheduled. The contract was awarded to British Pipeline Agency Ltd., BPA, which was the only company to submit an offer of tender. BP Ireland UK Ltd. and Shell UK Oil Ltd jointly own BPA. BPA is defined as a subsidiary undertaking of BPLC. The tender was received on 4 April 2005 and a draft contract issued to BPA on 6 April 2005.At no stage in any discussions with the Department did BPA raise the issue of any potential conflict of interest in carrying out this review. Notwithstanding that BP Oil UK Ltd. and Shell UK Oil Ltd. own the company jointly, BPA remains of the view there is no conflict of interest and states:BPA is a leading UK specialist in the onshore oil and gas pipeline sector, managing pipeline and terminal assets, and providing related technical consulting services to a wide range of companies worldwide.All work undertaken by BPA is treated as client confidential whether acting for a single client company or a consortia, and the ability to maintain client confidentiality is critical to BPA's continuing business success.In this instance BPA were "peer reviewing" technical work undertaken by another pipeline consultant for Shell, against accepted industry codes and standards.The Minister accepts fully that BPA has completed the review in a fully professional and objective manner. However, he remains conscious that the association of Shell UK Oil Ltd. with BPA by means of its 50% ownership of the company will raise questions as to the complete independence of the QRA review process. In the interest of ensuring confidence in the independence of the process of evaluation of the safety aspects of the pipeline as addressed by the QRA version F and considering the public concerns and sensitivities on this issue, the Minister has now initiated a further review of the QRA.With regard to the Corrib gas field terminal, I do not agree that the only option available in the interest of the health and safety of the Erris residents is an offshore terminal. I am satisfied the Department has given every consideration to relevant aspects of recommending the placing of the terminal onshore. In any case, there is no question of withdrawing any approvals already given.

I am not convinced this scheme does not have the potential to turn into another €50 million squandering of public money which could be used in any number of under funded areas highlighted recently, such as nursing homes or seatbelts on school buses.The Minister claims that a postcode is "a vital piece of infrastructure for any modern economy". This infrastructure exists already in the use of automated sorting, including optical character recognition, and the GeoDirectory system, which is a highly developed national address database system. An Post and the Ordnance Survey of Ireland established the GeoDirectory and they have invested significant resources in the technology. This system is excellent and, as the postcode working group reports, "provides a unique identifier for each building in the State, including penetration to individual delivery points in a building". The argument that a postcode system is essential for the quality and accuracy of postal delivery is nonsense and is discounted by the postcode working group's report.The An Post and Ordnance Survey GeoDirectory system is on the market already and is available for prospective postal operators to buy. Surely the fact that An Post has already spent significant resources on this technology and that it is commercially available must be recognised and taken into account by the Minister when deciding on the introduction of a postcode system. If a postcode system is introduced, will it be based on the existing and effective An Post technology? If not, how can the Minister justify the costs and operational difficulties this will generate for An Post and the Exchequer?The initial estimate for the proposed methodology and business plan is estimated at between €200,000 and €300,000. However, An Post estimates that it will cost it in excess of €6 million in private operational costs if postcodes are introduced. This is apart from the financial burden that will be placed on individual businesses and institutions across the country who will have to realign their databases and software to the new postcodes. The electoral register will also have to be revamped at considerable expense to local authorities.With this Government's and especially Deputy Noel Dempsey's record for taking up disastrous projects with huge price tags, such as the e-voting debacle, the prospects of spiralling and unacceptably high costs for this project are not unlikely. I have read the report on postcodes commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Has the Minister read it? If so, can he point out the disadvantages that Ireland suffers at present and detail how consumers, public services and postal operators will benefit from the introduction of some of the systems proposed? Can the Minister convince us that this postcode system is not being introduced so we can be bombarded more effectively with unsolicited and often junk mail? The commercial benefits are not quantifiable and the drawbacks of such increased so-called customer service and mailshot opportunities, from the general public's point of view, must be seriously considered.There are also serious data protection, privacy and socioeconomic policy concerns about postcodes. These codes, on the basis of experience in Dublin, can also be a code that unfairly categorises whole populations on the perceived economic status of the postcode area. Do we seriously want to replicate this throughout Ireland through the adoption of codes based on so-called atomic small areas? It is also clear from the postcode working group that the Dublin distinctions are unnecessary and could be abolished.If there is a case to be made for the establishment of universally known postcodes, let us prioritise the use of the existing system and minimise unnecessary spending by providing greater access to or full publication of the national GeoDirectory so every individual and household knows their postcode, as was proposed by the broadcaster Pat Kenny earlier this week. People have little difficulty remembering telephone and bank account numbers so why should a random digit postcode or zip code be any different? There is great potential in the existing system and a great danger that a new postcode scheme will become another disastrous and unnecessarily extravagant project to add to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey's, unfortunate and sad record.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I reply on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. A postcode is a necessary piece of infrastructure for a modern developed economy. Almost 90% of mail in Ireland is now generated by business. A recent report to the European Commission on developments in the European postal sector identified that Ireland has relatively low mail volumes.The report suggested that a possible explanation for this could be that Ireland is the only member state without a postcode system. The report further suggested that there is an unrealised potential for letter post growth in Ireland. Public services and utilities and private businesses, such as the ESB, Eircom and the banks are major users of the post and need a precise address for billing, sales, marketing and to assist field staff locating customers' premises. Without an effective postcode in Ireland, there is a real danger that not only postal operators but also consumers, business and public services will be at a disadvantage compared to our EU partners. The Government is committed to redressing this situation.To this end, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources established a working group comprising people with experience of the postal sector, together with a representative from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative to examine the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report earlier this month. The report found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits. The purpose of a postcode system would be to improve efficiencies and quality in the postal sector, stimulate mail volume growth, assist utilities and emergency services, address the problem of non-unique addressing and facilitate competition by making it easier for new postal operators to enter the market. These improvements collectively will boost the country's competitiveness. For this reason, the Minister has decided, in principle, that a postcode system should be in place by 2008.The Minister is asking the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to appoint project managers to support the postcode project. The next step is to establish a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments, together with public and private sector organisations which will be appointed by the Minister to assist the project managers with their work. It is hoped to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail what is the most efficient, effective and publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005.In its deliberations, the project board will examine all the options for a postcode system. This may include an examination of An Post's GeoDirectory. An Post has advised, however, that the geo-directory product is not a postcode system. It is a commercial, proprietary address database which is linked to geographical co-ordinates to provide a unique identifier for buildings which has been developed by An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland. The cost of the GeoDirectory product supplied by An Post comprises a once-off fee of €57,000 plus an annual licensing fee of 14% of the initial cost. It is a very useful product which is used by local authorities, emergency services and utilities, but it is not a publicly available postcode system. The generally accepted definition of a postcode is that it is an identifier that identifies the addressee's locality and assists in the transmission and sorting of mail. Effectively, a postcode is primarily to facilitate mail delivery.While a postcode can be used with automated mail process systems, it must also be capable of being used with manual systems. The GeoDirectory product is a building identifier and the purpose of a postcode system is to make it easier to process and deliver mail. A publicly available postcode system would help organisations to direct mail more accurately and provide better customer service. In response to the ComReg consultation on postcodes, organisations such as the ESB and BreastCheck were in favour of postcodes because they help to provide better access to customers. In addition, the Department has received correspondence in support of the initiative.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I thank the Minister for taking this Adjournment matter and the Ceann Comhairle for permitting it. I seek clarification in regard to a parliamentary question I asked the Minister for Education and Science yesterday seeking information on Athy community college. Two years ago, I attended a function at which the Taoiseach turned the sod at the school, yet no progress has been made since then. Further concerns have been raised by the Minister's reply yesterday. She stated:However, due to a decline in enrolment trends and the level of investment which would be required to facilitate a relatively small number of pupils, it was decided not to allow the proposed building project to progress through architectural planning until a complete review of the long-term viability of the school has been carried out.This would seem to contradict everyone's view of the project, including that of the Taoiseach, who turned the sod two years ago.The development plan for Athy has led to major population growth in the town. In 1970, the population stood at 4,270 whereas the latest development plan envisages a population of 16,000, not including the catchment areas of Ballylinan, Kilberry, Kilkee, Kilmead and other small villages which have experienced population increase. In fact, all the south Kildare area that is attached to Athy for educational purposes has experienced a major increase in population. Nonetheless, a major dent has been put in one of the flagship educational projects in the area, namely, the completion of a new college at Athy.Has the development been put on the back burner? How long will the review of the viability of the school take? Have there been second thoughts regarding the project? What aspect of the development will progress? Will the present school be developed or will a new school be developed on the site opened by the Taoiseach? What is the position in regard to this much needed educational facility in the context of the recent expansion of population in south Kildare, which highlights the need for it? At least 1,000 houses are at construction stage in the area and a greater number are at the planning stage with the local town council. It beggars belief that this infrastructure project, which is vital given the young population of the town and its hinterland, seems to be going backwards.The Minister of State should clarify the situation. He should alleviate the concerns of the teachers of the school and local primary school pupils, who would benefit from the school. Education in south Kildare would benefit if he could give a clear picture regarding the provision of this college.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank Deputy Wall for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity for me, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to outline to the House the action planned to progress the application for capital funding from Athy community college.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.We have progressively increased funding for the schools modernisation programme in recent years to achieve our goal, with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion allocated for this purpose since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. Since the beginning of the year the Minister for Education and Science has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and €223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.The programmes supported will include the following: 141 major building projects already on site and a further 28 due to commence in the coming weeks; 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation; up to 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs; 43 schools which have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects and 124 which have been approved to progress through the architectural planning process; and 590 schools which were recently given approval to complete essential small-scale projects under the summer works scheme. I am pleased to inform Deputy Wall that Athy community college is included in this number, having secured funding to upgrade its gas system.With regard to the school's large-scale project, in May 1999 the school authority, Kildare Vocational Education Committee, applied for the replacement of its building. This was agreed and an accommodation brief for a new school was set at 350 pupil places. The VEC appealed this decision, arguing for a 500 pupil facility based on its assessment of the anticipated increase in the demographics of the area, an anticipated increased demand for post-leaving certificate and vocational training opportunities scheme courses and a naturally accruing demand for places in a new state-of-the-art facility.The matter was reviewed in the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science and it was decided that an accommodation brief based on a long-term projected enrolment of 400 pupil places was more realistic. A design team was appointed on this basis and the proposed project reached stage 1 in the architectural planning process. A review was carried out at that point to firm up on the size of the school for the design team. On foot of this review, it emerged that there was a significant decline in enrolments. In view of this development and the level of investment which would be required to facilitate a relatively small number of pupils, it was decided not to allow the proposed building project to progress through architectural planning until a complete review of the long-term viability of the school has been carried out. This is under way in the school planning section of the Department. The review will be carried out as quickly as possible and the school authority will be notified of the outcome without delay.Once again I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the processes used by the Department of Education and Science in determining how projects are assessed for capital funding. These processes are employed in the interests of openness and transparency, and to reassure all schools that they will be treated in a fair and equitable manner.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 51 together.As stated on several previous occasions, the Government's position on the lifting of the EU arms embargo on arms sales to China is clear. We support the lifting of the embargo but we do not wish to see any increase in the quantity or quality of arms exports to China.Our position was set out by the Taoiseach during his visit to Beijing in January 2005, when he also explained the importance to the EU of continued progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in China. The Government's position was repeated in May during the course of bilateral consultations with China which were held at senior official level in Dublin.At its meeting in December 2004, the European Council reaffirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the arms embargo. It invited the incoming Luxembourg Presidency to finalise the well-advanced work on this issue in order to allow for a decision while underlining that the result of any decision should not be an increase in arms exports from EU member states to China.The Council also recalled the importance of the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which has been in operation since 1998 and contains criteria for assessing such exports, including those relating to human rights, stability and security in the relevant region and the national security of friendly countries. The Council stressed the importance of the early adoption of a revised code of conduct on which work is continuing and which will reinforce existing EU controls and of a new instrument on arms exports known as the Toolbox. This instrument is being developed by the EU and comprises a set of measures which may be applied to a country when an arms embargo against it has been lifted. Essentially, it will provide for a greater level of information sharing and enhanced transparency within the EU regarding arms exports to countries which had been subject to an arms embargo. Discussions on the code of conduct and the Toolbox continue at official level.As the EU works towards lifting the arms embargo, it has also engaged in recent weeks in a dialogue on the issue at senior official level with key partners, including the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia. EU Foreign Ministers reiterated their wish to develop further the relationship with China when they met for an informal discussion in Luxembourg on 15 and 16 April. The importance attached by the Union to human rights and the peaceful resolution of differences was reiterated in this context. The Ministers also agreed to continue to work on strengthening the code of conduct and on the so-called Toolbox, in line with the European Council mandate. These points were conveyed to Chinese Foreign Minister Li when he met the troika of EU Foreign Ministers at the EU-China ministerial meeting held in Beijing from 11-12 May 2005.The Government continues to examine this issue with our EU partners, in the context of our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. I have not held discussions with EU colleagues on the lifting of the embargo since questions were last put in the House on 28 April. EU Ministers will resume consideration of a decision on lifting the embargo once technical work on revising the EU code of conduct on arms exports has been completed. A decision to lift the embargo will require unanimous approval among member states.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The EU constitution puts in place a new arrangement, known as permanent structured co-operation, to enable those member states wishing to do so to commit to being able to undertake the most demanding crisis management missions. Structured co-operation is open to all member states, on the condition that they undertake to enhance their defence capacities through the development of national contributions and subject to participation in a number of areas specified in the constitution. It does not allow for or involve any mutual defence commitment, or any binding commitment to deploy troops in any specific operation. Neither does it allow for the participants in structured cooperation to mount missions on behalf of the EU other than with the approval of the Council as a whole, acting unanimously.Member states can indicate their decision to take part in structured co-operation once the constitution comes into force. Alternatively, member states which decide not to participate immediately can decide to do so at a later date, providing they meet the criteria outlined. Decision-making procedures in relation to structured cooperation are set out in the EU constitution. These provide that decisions will be taken by unanimity among the states participating in permanent structured co-operation. The detailed arrangements for the implementation of structured co-operation have yet to be elaborated.As the EU constitution provides that permanent structured cooperation will operate on an opt-in basis there is accordingly no obligation for Ireland to take part. The question would not arise to be decided until after the entry into force of the EU constitution. The Government will take a decision on whether or not Ireland should participate in structured cooperation in due course, once it becomes clear as to precisely what commitments are involved.

The question of a referendum in Denmark is for the Danish people and their Government. The referendum is scheduled for 27 September. The indications are that it is the current intention of the Danish Government to proceed.In regard to the timing of the Irish referendum, no date has yet been set. We are continuing to make the preparations necessary to allow for ratification by the target date of November 2006. The publication last week of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was an important step in this regard.In advance of the finalisation of the Bill, the Government consulted with those parties which had indicated clear support for the EU constitution and reached a broad consensus with them. On the day of the Bill's publication, last Thursday, I briefed the Green Party and organised an official level briefing for Sinn Féin.Under the Referendum Acts, the publication of the Bill allows for the establishment of the Referendum Commission through an order made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Government has made clear that the Referendum Commission will have the time and resources necessary to carry out its tasks, which include informing the public on the subject matter of a referendum and encouraging voter turnout.In addition, the Government, and others, have been making strenuous efforts to publicise and explain the EU constitution. The National Forum on Europe has had a very busy schedule of meetings in recent months, including several meetings outside Dublin. Both the Government and the forum published initial explanatory material on the EU constitution last autumn. My Department has since then launched a dedicated website on the EU constitution and the Government has prepared a comprehensive White Paper which will be ready for publication shortly. We would also intend to circulate summary information material to every household.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 49, 83 and 94 together.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, which is the most universal of all of the multilateral instruments in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, came into force in 1970. The treaty has been reviewed at five-year intervals to assess progress under its three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The seventh NPT review conference took place on 2 to 27 May 2005 at the United Nations in New York. During the general debate, I delivered a statement on behalf of Ireland, the full text of which is available on the Department's website.In my statement, I recalled Ireland's close association with the treaty, which was negotiated following an initiative taken by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, in 1958. I noted that the Government's highest priority in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation is support for efforts to strengthen the treaty. In the course of my remarks, I referred to the need to address serious challenges which have subjected the global non-proliferation regime to severe strain in recent years. I also emphasised the particular importance attached by Ireland to fulfilment of the nuclear disarmament obligations set out in Article VI of the treaty and reaffirmed and developed at previous NPT review conferences. Under this Article, the states parties, including the five nuclear weapon states, China, France, the Russian Federation, the UK and US, undertook to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures leading to nuclear disarmament.I also drew attention to a number of important questions which the conference should address. These included consideration of the implications of states parties deciding to withdraw from the treaty. I also called for the strengthening of the IAEA safeguards system. I suggested that the current safeguards agreements, under which the agency verifies that nuclear materials and facilities in non-nuclear weapons states are used for peaceful purposes, should be reinforced by the IAEA additional protocol, which requires states parties to provide additional information and access to the agency inspectors.I underlined my belief that the continued retention of nuclear weapons, or the unsatisfactory rate of progress in their elimination, can never serve as a justification for their development by other states. I also stressed the need to respect the current moratorium on testing pending the early entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty, CTBT, which prohibits states parties from carrying out any nuclear explosion. I called for the negotiation, without delay, of a fissile material cut-off treaty, FMCT, which would ban the further production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.The review conference ended last Friday without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. While delegations were able to address substance in both the general debate and discussions in the three main committees, some two and a half weeks out of the four weeks were taken up by difficulties in respect of the agenda and organisation of work.The Government is particularly disappointed that it did not prove possible to make further progress on the implementation of the nuclear disarmament obligation as set out in Article VI of the treaty. What we regard as the central bargain of the treaty, that the non-nuclear weapon states would not develop such weapons in return for which the nuclear weapon states would reduce and eliminate their nuclear weapons, was further developed at the NPT review conferences in 1995 and 2000. In 1995, states parties adopted a work programme on nuclear disarmament, which included the completion of negotiations of the CTBT, the immediate commencement of negotiations on the FMCT and the pursuit by nuclear weapons states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally. Ireland, as a member of the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, was actively involved in the negotiation of the 2000 final document, which includes the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapons states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and which we believe provides a realistic blueprint for achieving nuclear disarmament. We had hoped that the most recent review conference would have enabled us to build on these earlier documents by agreeing to accelerate their implementation.Ireland acknowledges the right of states parties to the NPT under Article IV of the treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in conformity with the safeguards obligations of the treaty. At the same time, we have made clear on various occasions that we do not, ourselves, wish to exercise that right.The Government is deeply disappointed at the outcome of the conference which we feel is a missed opportunity for the international community to tackle, together, some key threats to global peace and security and to agree an effective collective response. Failure of NPT review conferences to reach a substantive result is not without precedent in the 35 year history of the treaty but it is all the more worrying given the scale of the challenges which have threatened to undermine the authority and credibility of the non-proliferation regime and risk its further erosion. The challenges remain to be tackled and we must work with our partners in the EU and other groups to find a way to make progress.The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in addressing the current situation, has stressed the need for leadership and pointed to the forthcoming meeting of Heads of State and Government in New York in September as a crucial opportunity to show such leadership. He has called on them to break the deadlock on the most pressing challenges in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and to take concrete steps to revitalise the NPT. We believe that states parties to the NPT must respond to the Secretary General's call and seek to identify ways that the NPT regime can be further strengthened. We are firmly of the view that the NPT is now more than ever of tremendous importance to the achievement of international peace and security. As I noted in my address, our success in halting the erosion of the non-proliferation regime will be an acid test of the effectiveness of the entire multilateral system.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The security situation in Iraq has greatly reduced the capacity of those working in the humanitarian field to provide assistance to the civilian population and has also resulted in a slowing down of reconstruction programmes in the country. Over the past months, many humanitarian agencies have been forced to leave Iraq altogether following armed attacks and kidnappings of aid workers. The House is well aware of the price paid by such dedicated and courageous humanitarians as our own Margaret Hassan, whose death in November of last year reminded us all of the risks involved in operating in an environment as dangerous as that of Iraq. Even the most dedicated and courageous, however, are finding it increasingly difficult to work in such circumstances. In early May, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had been the only international relief agency to maintain a continuous operational presence in central, southern and northern parts of Iraq since the start of the current conflict, was compelled to suspend virtually all assistance activities in the country.Problems of humanitarian access mean that it is difficult to get precise statistics on the extent of the suffering of the civilian population. According to UN agency and Red Cross reports, large numbers of civilians have been displaced and essential services, such as water, health care, electricity and education, have been severely disrupted in many areas because of both the actions of insurgents and the military response of the coalition forces to the insurgency. The humanitarian situation is especially worrying in and around areas such as Fallujah, Ramadi, Kirkuk, Mosul and Al-Qaim.Since the beginning of the current conflict, the Government has committed itself to providing assistance to the Iraqi people. In 2003, assistance worth €5 million was delivered by Ireland to meet the immediate emergency humanitarian needs of some of the most vulnerable in that country. Funding was delivered through key NGO partners such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire and through UN and international agencies such as the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Red Cross family.In October 2003, the Government pledged a further €3 million at the donors' conference on Iraq in Madrid. To date, €1.5 million of this pledge has been delivered. Some €1 million has been channelled through the international reconstruction facility for Iraq to support UNICEF's primary education programme. Some €500,000 has been delivered to the NGO AMAR for health care programmes to assist the Marsh Arab population of southern Iraq, which suffered considerably under the former regime.The ongoing security situation in Iraq and the operational constraints on humanitarian organisations have impacted on the draw-down of pledged funding. However, the Government remains ready to commit the balance of the funding as soon as suitable humanitarian programmes, which can be delivered in this challenging environment, are identified by UN or international agencies and NGOs.

The fund's objective is to finance, through specific grants, the provision of works and services necessary to transform the existing shelter. This comprises the provision of technical assistance, public information, consultancy, civil works and engineering services and the acquisition and installation of equipment.Ireland has made a significant bilateral contribution to the fund against a background of strong and continuing public support for the victims of the Chernobyl disaster and awareness and concern about the dangers of nuclear energy. At the initial pledging conference for the fund in 1997 Ireland committed a contribution of US$2.9 million over three years. A second contribution of US$2.9 million covering a further three year period was committed at a further pledging conference held in 2000. At a pledging conference held in London last month, we made a further commitment to continue funding in the amount of €2.565 million over the period 2004-06. A total of US$935 million has been pledged to the fund to date by the international community, including a significant contribution by the European Union. Ireland's contribution to the Chernobyl shelter fund appears as a charge on the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote.Twice yearly assembly of contributors meetings are held at the EBRD to review progress on the project and to approve the relevant financial reports. These are attended at official level by Ireland and the other contributors. The most recent meeting was held on 12 May at which, inter alia, the annual financial report for the fund for 2004 was approved. Ireland is represented on the board of governors of the EBRD by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and on the board of directors by Mr. Desmond O’Malley.

The Council strongly condemned the reported use of force by the Uzbek security forces, which it characterised as "excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate." It urged the Uzbek authorities to act with restraint to avoid further loss of life and encouraged all sides to work towards a peaceful and sustainable solution to the situation.The Council also expressed concern about the situation of Uzbek refugees who have crossed into Kyrgyzstan and urged both countries to respect their commitments under international conventions on internally displaced persons and refugees. The Ministers called on the Uzbek authorities to grant immediate and unimpeded access to humanitarian agencies and other relevant international organisations to the area. The Council signalled its readiness to use instruments available under the EU-Uzbekistan Partnership and Co-operation Agreement to assist the affected population in its immediate humanitarian needs.The Council deeply regretted the failure of the Uzbek authorities to respond adequately to the call from the United Nations for an independent international inquiry to take place. It urged them to reconsider their position and stated that the Council would consider further steps, depending on the response.Previously on 18 May, I expressed my deep concern at the reports of killings of unarmed civilians and called for the facts to be independently established. I also said that the root causes of the instability needed to be addressed. This will no doubt require political and economic reforms in order to improve the daily lives of all the people of Uzbekistan. This point was taken up in the Council conclusions which urged the Uzbek authorities to carry out domestic reforms essential for social and economic development and for the achievement of democracy and stability in the country. The conclusions stated that the Council would co-ordinate with the OSCE, the Russian Federation and the United States in order to effectively support reforms.In view of reports in recent days that some refugees are being forced to return to Uzbekistan from Kyrgyzstan, I would like to reiterate the importance we attach to full compliance by both countries with international conventions on internally displaced persons and refugees. It is vital that the human rights and dignity of those who have fled as a result of the unrest in Uzbekistan be respected. In my view, a failure to independently investigate the events at Andijan cannot be without consequences for relations with the European Union. If the Uzbek authorities persist in their refusal to establish a fully independent inquiry, further measures will have to be considered at a future Council meeting.

As regards the grades of staff involved, I have made available with my earlier reply a table detailing applications which have been made under the central applications facility, CAF, for Development Cooperation Ireland posts in Limerick. A number of representations have been received referring to potential risks to the aid programme arising from decentralisation to Limerick. We will do everything in our power to mitigate those risks.Decentralisation is a voluntary process. To date, a number of staff have chosen to move with Development Cooperation Ireland to Limerick. I hope that more will volunteer as we approach the decentralisation date. In addition, a number of staff of my Department have opted for decentralisation with other Departments.The position in regard to development specialists who do not opt to transfer to Limerick is dependent on the outcome of a case before the Labour Court and central negotiations between unions and the Department of Finance. For all staff in Development Cooperation Ireland, decentralisation will mean a period of change. Major challenges will have to be faced. Senior management in Development Cooperation Ireland are making every effort to ensure that there is full and satisfactory communication and consultation with staff during this period.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	290	In the context of examining the opportunities for better co-ordination and operational response to future disasters and humanitarian emergencies abroad, an interdepartmental audit of the assets and capacities available to Ireland is currently underway.This audit is intended to identify gaps and shortfalls in overall international capabilities at EU and UN level where Ireland might practically make a contribution. The audit will also examine how Ireland might best fill gaps that have been identified and the costs associated with the provision of trained and available assets. Once this audit is completed, which I expect will be in the coming months, we will be in a clearer position to decide how Ireland can best contribute to overall international efforts to assist in large-scale rapid onset emergency situations.Since the Asian tsunami disaster, the issue of responding effectively to natural and humanitarian disasters abroad has been a particular focus of European Union deliberations. The main challenge for the EU is to ensure that it is able to respond rapidly and flexibly. Whether this is through improving mechanisms that already exist to respond to these type of events — such as the mechanism for civil protection or European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, civilian capabilities — or through creating a new rapid response structure is an issue that is currently being discussed by member states.Ireland has consistently supported the development of the EU's civilian capabilities to respond to crisis situations, both in respect of natural disasters, such as the Asian tsunami, and in the context of conflict and post-conflict scenarios. We have committed civilian resources through both the community mechanism for civil protection and, more broadly, through the civilian capabilities commitment process under the ESDP. These resources range from police capabilities to rule of law experts to civil protection personnel.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Dr. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam is the chairperson of the Sudan Social Development Organisation, SUDO, a voluntary organisation created to promote sustainable development and human rights in Sudan. It is engaged in humanitarian activities in the Darfur region as well as in human rights education and development projects throughout Sudan. Dr. Mudawi was previously arrested on 24 January 2005 and detained until 8 March 2005, when he was released on bail. While in custody he went on hunger strike and was subsequently charged with attempting to commit suicide. This charge has not yet been formally withdrawn. In 2004, Dr. Mudawi spent seven months in police custody, having been charged, in connection with his human rights work, of committing offences against the state. Following the hearing of his trial on 7 August 2004, all charges against Dr. Mudawi were dropped and he was released.Dr. Mudawi was detained on 8 May 2005, shortly before he was due to travel to Ireland to be presented with the inaugural front line award for human rights defenders by President McAleese. Three days later, Dr. Mudawi and his colleague Mr. Yasir Salim were charged under the Sudanese penal code with espionage against the country and entering and photographing military areas and works. The first charge carries a potential penalty of death or life imprisonment. On Friday, 13 May 2005 the front line award was accepted on Dr. Mudawi's behalf by his wife, Mrs. Sabah Mohammed Adam Ali and daughter Huda from President McAleese at a ceremony held in Dublin's City Hall. Following Dr. Mudawi's detention, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, contacted senior officials of the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his behalf, while the Irish ambassador in Cairo and, at our request, the representatives of the EU Presidency in Khartoum also followed up this case actively. Both Seanad Éireann and the European Parliament adopted resolutions calling for the immediate release of Dr. Mudawi. The Government of Sudan's decision to release Dr. Mudawi and his colleague reflects recognition of the widespread international concern which this case had generated.At the time of Dr. Mudawi's release on 16 May, the Government welcomed this decision by the Government of Sudan and the Minister of State wrote to the Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs in a letter which also expressed hope that this release will be followed by the speedy conclusion of the case against Dr. Mudawi and Mr. Salim once the Sudanese legal authorities have completed their investigations. He also called for the release of three other members of SUDO who are currently being detained.One of the key priorities in the field of human rights during the 2004 Irish Presidency of the European Union was the adoption by member states of guidelines on human rights defenders. The guidelines aim to mainstream concern for human rights defenders into EU foreign policy. The cases of Dr. Mudawi and his colleagues amply illustrate the continuing need for action in this area. The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Sudan and of human rights defenders around the world.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I remain very concerned at the continuing detention and treatment of Mr. Roy Bennett, the former MDC, Movement for Democratic Change, MP for the Chimanimani constituency in the Zimbabwean parliament who was sentenced by the Zimbabwean parliament last October to 12 months imprisonment for pushing the Zimbabwean Minister for Justice during a parliamentary debate, an offence which, if heard in an ordinary civil court, would only have attracted a small fine as a maximum penalty.Having been initially cleared by the Zimbabwean electoral court to stand in the parliamentary election on 31 March last, Mr. Bennett was subsequently prevented from doing so, following a decision by the Zimbabwean government to appeal the electoral court ruling. In his absence, Mr. Bennett's wife, Heather, contested his seat but was defeated by the ZANU-PF candidate. I understand that the MDC is contesting the result in Mr. Bennett's Chimanimani constituency, in a case lodged with the Zimbabwean electoral court.On 9 May, Mr. Bennett was transferred from Mutoko prison to Chikurubi reform prison, a high security penitentiary facility near Harare. No explanation has been provided to either Mr. Bennett's family or his lawyers as to the reasons for his transfer. The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, ZLHR, has expressed concerns about the reasons for the transfer and the apparently very poor conditions in which Mr. Bennett is now being detained in Chikurubi prison. The ZLHR has also expressed concern that Mr. Bennett's health will deteriorate even further under the conditions in which he is now being detained and they have filed a case with the African Commission on Human and People's Rights for his immediate release.Separate legal proceedings are also being taken in the Zimbabwean Supreme Court with a view to securing Mr. Bennett's release. Following a two day hearing on 26 to 27 May, the Supreme Court in Harare reserved judgment indefinitely in the case taken by Mr. Bennett's lawyers. There are no indications of any intention on the part of the Zimbabwean Government to release Mr. Bennett before the completion of his 12 month sentence next October.The Government, through the Irish ambassador to South Africa who is also accredited to Zimbabwe, has been active in making known to the Zimbabwean authorities its serious concerns regarding the imprisonment and treatment of Mr. Bennett. These concerns will be reiterated when the ambassador pays a further visit to Zimbabwe next week. The ambassador will also draw the attention of the Zimbabwean authorities to the terms of the motion adopted unanimously by Dáil Éireann on 24 March 2005 expressing concern at the treatment afforded to Mr. Bennett and at his politically motivated sentencing. A copy of this motion has already been forwarded to the speaker of the Zimbabwean Parliament, via the embassy in South Africa. We will also continue to raise the issue at EU level and urge EU ambassadors in Harare to be active on Mr. Bennett's behalf.

In the aftermath of the local and Westminster elections, I believe it is important to advance this vital project, to resolve the crisis of trust and confidence and move beyond the current political stalemate.The Government's priority in the coming weeks and months is to encourage and facilitate the necessary definitive closure of paramilitarism and criminality. This requirement applies to all paramilitary organisations but IRA compliance is particularly important if there is to be any prospect of restoring inclusive devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. We now need the IRA to deliver a clear and decisive response.As I said in a recent speech at UCD, "ifthe IRA is decisively removed from the equation . . ., and if that outcome is validated and verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and by the Independent Monitoring Commission, the Irish Government will expect the DUP to commit itself to inclusive power-sharing within the Assembly and the Executive and to fully work the North-South institutions of the Agreement".The results of the elections have consolidated the leadership positions held by the DUP and Sinn Féin in the Unionist and Nationalist communities, respectively. There is a correspondingly increased responsibility on them to work to achieve the restoration of the institutions. At the same time, the SDLP, UUP and the Alliance Party continue to have considerable electoral mandates and have important roles to play. The Government is continuing with our contacts with all parties to move matters forward and, along with the Taoiseach, I met the SDLP leader, Mark Durkan, and a delegation from the party on 23 May.We are also working in partnership with the British Government to continue to implement the Agreement, and a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will take place towards the end of this month. The conference will have a full agenda, including in the areas of justice and security, equality, and human rights.We remain fully committed to the full and stable operation of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement on an inclusive basis. That is what the people voted for when they solemnly endorsed the Agreement in referendums in both parts of the island.

This position has been recognised in its common positions on the International Criminal Court, the most recent of which, of June 2003, commits the Union and its member states to support the effective functioning of the court, and to advance universal support for it by promoting the widest possible participation in the Rome statute. In February 2004, a detailed action plan on the implementation of the 2003 common position was adopted.The EU has identified the achievement of further ratifications of accessions to the Rome statute as a particular priority. Further ratifications and accessions boost the credibility of the court, as well as increase the court's operational capacity to deal with alleged crimes, as states parties are obliged to assist the ICC in its investigations. To date, 99 states have ratified or acceded to the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court.The United States of America signed the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court in December 2000. However, in May 2002, the US informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that it did not intend to become party to the statute and that accordingly, it had no obligations arising from its signature.The objections of the US to the International Criminal Court are based on its view that, because of the independence of the prosecutor of the ICC, US citizens and in particular its military forces, could be subjected to politically motivated prosecutions. As I have stated before, while I recognise these concerns, I do not share them nor are they shared by our EU partners.The Council of the European Union, in its conclusions of 30 September 2002, proposed to develop a broader dialogue between the European Union and the United States on all matters related to the International Criminal Court. The EU remains willing to engage in such dialogue and maintains contact with the US on the matter.

The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, outlined the case in detail to the House in recent weeks. I stress that from the beginning the Government has been actively engaged in seeking to find a solution to this difficult case. An embassy official was sent to the orphanage immediately after we learned of Tristan's situation to check on his welfare and, since then, the Department has been actively seeking clarity on his status. Tristan's welfare and best interests have always been and remain our foremost priority.A delegation joined the Irish ambassador in Jakarta last month with instructions from the Government to take all appropriate steps to move this case forward. The delegation consisted of the deputy legal adviser of the Department of Foreign Affairs, a member of the Adoption Board and its senior social worker. During their visit they met Indonesian Government officials and others with the aim of seeking to identify the child's needs and working towards meeting them. For their part, the Indonesian authorities undertook to contact us shortly in relation to how they propose to deal with the situation. We will, of course, keep in close contact with them and, in this regard, the ambassador has returned to Jakarta this week for further meetings.High Court proceedings against Joseph Dowse and Lala Dowse have been instigated by the Attorney General in his role as protector of the unprotected. As the matter is before the court, it is not appropriate to comment further.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 102 together.There is no firm figure for the number of undocumented Irish emigrants in the United States. There are a number of estimates, including a figure of 3,000 by the US authorities for the year 2000. This seems to the Irish immigration centres to be a very low figure. More recently, a figure of 50,000 has been mentioned in some quarters but this is probably too high. In an overall statistical context, the numbers of Irish undocumented are not significant, given that the total number of undocumented is believed to be over 9 million, of whom the overwhelming majority are Hispanic.The Taoiseach and I had a very positive discussion on immigration reform with President Bush on St. Patrick's Day. Following this, I asked my officials to look again at ways of getting a more precise sense of the size of our undocumented population, including the possibility of setting up an on-line database for this purpose. However, the widespread view was that our undocumented would be very unlikely to register on a database. I can understand this and remain open to any further suggestions which may assist.I would again like warmly to commend the role and work of the immigration centres in the US, in particular the support, information and advice which they make available to our communities there. Funding from my Department to these organisations increased by 83% last year. I am pleased that, given the substantial increase in funding secured for emigrant services in 2005, I will be in a position to grant even more support to them this year.On the broader front, there has been some positive progress on immigration reform. In a significant development on 12 May, Senators McCain and Kennedy, in cooperation with several of their colleagues in the House of Representatives, published a Bill which would grant undocumented people an opportunity to regularise their status. I warmly welcome this important, timely and very positive contribution to advancing the debate on this sensitive issue. Our priority in the period ahead will be to lobby strongly in support of the Kennedy and McCain Bill, and to encourage the White House to become actively involved in the immigration reform process.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Croatia applied for membership of the European Union in 2003, and the Commission presented its formal opinion on the application in April 2004. The June 2004 European Council agreed that Croatia fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria and the specific conditions established for the countries of the western Balkans. It decided that Croatia is a candidate country for membership, and that accession negotiations should open early in 2005. This decision was confirmed by the December 2004 European Council, which decided that negotiations should open on 17 March 2005, provided there was full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.When the General Affairs Council met in Brussels on 16 March, it was clear that it would not be possible to achieve the unanimous decision of member states that is required for the opening of accession negotiations. The Council reaffirmed the commitment of the EU to Croatia's membership, and it adopted the necessary negotiating framework. However, in the absence of unanimity on the extent of Croatia's co-operation with the tribunal, the Council postponed the meeting of the bilateral intergovernmental conference to begin accession negotiations until it establishes that Croatia is cooperating fully with the tribunal.The tribunal has identified a single remaining case which Croatia needs to resolve, that of the indicted former general Ante Gotovina, who remains in hiding. The European Council in Brussels on 23 March agreed to establish a team to work with the tribunal and with Croatia, and to report back to the Council. The team is composed of the current and future Presidencies of Luxembourg, UK and Austria, together with High Representative Solana and the Commission. It held its first meetings with the chief prosecutor of the tribunal and the foreign minister of Croatia, in Luxembourg on 26 April. On the basis of developments, the forthcoming European Council on 16-17 June will consider whether sufficient progress has been made for a decision to open the accession negotiations with Croatia. I look forward to a detailed preparatory discussion at the General Affairs Council on 13 June.The Government remains strongly committed to Croatia's future membership of the European Union. We were very pleased that it proved possible to achieve a strong, unanimous decision by the European Council on Croatia's candidate status during Ireland's EU Presidency. We agree on the importance of full co-operation with the tribunal by all the countries of the western Balkans, and that it is an essential requirement for the development of closer relations with the EU. Over the past 18 months, Croatia has made very significant progress in its cooperation with the tribunal, and I hope that the last remaining issue can be resolved as quickly as possible. I believe it is important that the Council remains ready to take a positive decision on the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia, at the earliest opportunity.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Turkey has been a candidate for membership of the European Union since the Helsinki European Council in December 1999, which agreed that it was destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria applied to the other candidate states. The European Council in Brussels on 16-17 December 2004 decided, on the basis of the Commission's report and recommendation, that Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria to enable the opening of accession negotiations. It requested the Commission to begin work on a proposal for a negotiating framework and to present it to the Council, with a view to the opening of accession negotiations on 3 October 2005. The pace of the negotiations will depend in large part on progress in the implementation of Turkey's wide-ranging reform programme.Turkey has made very significant progress in recent years in legislating for reform. Important human rights reforms have been introduced, including legislation to protect freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, and the rights of women. In taking the decision to open accession negotiations, the December European Council emphasised the importance of sustaining the reform process and it underlined the need for early progress on six specific items of legislation identified by the Commission. I welcome the entry into force of five of these legislative reforms, on schedule, by 1 April 2005. The sixth, the comprehensive reform of the Turkish penal code, was approved by the Turkish Parliament on 27 May.The December European Council expressed confidence that Turkey will continue to address areas in which reforms are needed. These include points of continuing concern which have been clearly identified by the Commission, including freedom of religion, freedom of expression, women's rights, and the zero tolerance policy in the fight against torture. The Commission will continue to monitor the reform process closely. It is essential that it is seen to be irreversible and that reform legislation is fully implemented throughout the country and at all levels of the administration. In the period ahead, member states will consider proposals from the Commission for a revised accession partnership with Turkey, setting out priorities for the continued implementation of the reform process. The Council will also consider proposals from the Commission for a detailed framework for the accession negotiations.Turkey is also committed to signing the protocol adapting the 1963 Ankara agreement of association in order to take account of the accession of ten new member states, including the Republic of Cyprus, and to do so before the actual start of accession negotiations. I welcome the recent agreement by Turkey to the text of the protocol submitted by the Commission. The early signature of the protocol, its ratification and its subsequent implementation would constitute important steps forward towards normalisation of relations between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus.The Government will continue to work with our partners in the Union, and with Turkey, to ensure that all the elements are in place for the successful opening of accession negotiations on 3 October.

It generally affects the most productive and economically active members of society. In societies where most people depend on agriculture as a source of income, there is a strong association between high rates of HIV infection and food insecurity. The scarcity of food increases the risk of exposure to HIV-AIDS. Infection with HIV-AIDS in turn increases the vulnerability of families to food insecurity.Eastern and southern regions of Africa are at the epicentre of the AIDS pandemic. It is in countries such Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Lesotho that the greatest concentration of assistance is required to address the structural problems contributing to food insecurity and diseases such as HIV-AIDS. In these situations, there is need for action on two levels: responding to needs related to the current crisis, while simultaneously supporting actions that address longer-term needs.Responding to the problem of HIV-AIDS is a key priority for the Irish development co-operation programme. Ireland was one of the first donors to develop a HIV-AIDS strategy and since 2001 the financial allocations to the fight against AIDS have increased tenfold with a budget allocation reaching almost €50 million this year. Through our work with the EU and the United Nations funds and programmes, we work at an international level to advocate for a sustained and well-resourced global response to HIV-AIDS.Ireland is supportive of the introduction of anti-retroviral treatment programmes in developing countries in the context of national responses which encompass prevention, treatment and care in an integrated manner. In these countries we have supported the strengthening of health systems, the procurement and supply of medication and the training of health workers, all of which are necessary for the introduction of HIV treatment programmes. In addition to this, Ireland supports the implementation of the 3 X 5 Initiative of the World Health Organisation, a programme that aims to have 3 million people in developing countries accessing HIV treatment programmes by the end of 2005. Ireland is also working closely with and providing financial assistance to the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation. This partnership provides financial and technical support to assist in the preparation of integrated HIV-AIDS treatment, care and prevention programmes.Ireland is also supplying technical and financial support to governments, NGOs and UN agencies to help them to respond effectively to the twin challenges of HIV-AIDS and food insecurity. We are also actively supporting the development of a new European Commission programme for action to confront AIDS, TB and malaria.Although there has been progress over the last three years in responding to the critical needs of people living in the region, there is a recognition that responding to HIV-AIDS, restoring food supplies and providing effective treatment will only happen after sustained assistance by governments and international organisations. I am determined that, in the context of a growing official aid programme, Ireland will continue to provide assistance to governments and international organisations that are effectively responding to the enormous development challenges presented by this disease.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK announced in February 2005 that it had produced and now possesses nuclear weapons and that it is to suspend its participation in the six party talks for an indefinite period. In May 2005, the DPRK further announced that it had finished extracting 8,000 fuel rods from its reactor at Yongbyon, which it reportedly shut down a month ago. The DPRK has previously claimed to have extracted the rods and reprocessed the fuel into plutonium. Claims were also reportedly made that it was taking measures to bolster its nuclear arsenal.Given the nature of the regime in the DPRK and its strict control of information, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of such announcements. Normally, the International Atomic Energy Agency can offer reliable information on a country's nuclear programme. However, the IAEA has not been permitted to inspect the DPRK's nuclear facilities since its inspectors were expelled from the DPRK in 2002. The agency is, therefore, not in a position to ascertain the validity of the recent statements from the DPRK.The DPRK's regional neighbours and parties involved in the six party talks, SPT, process, are continuing their efforts to encourage the DPRK to return to the stalled talks on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The SPT process involves the DPRK, the Republic of Korea, China, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States. Three rounds of talks have taken place since the process was initiated in 2003. While not directly involved in these talks, the EU has availed of every opportunity to confirm the Union's willingness to contribute to the international efforts to move matters forward. The Union has also indicated its readiness to consider enhanced cooperation with the DPRK if the present difficult situation can be resolved in a satisfactory manner.The issue of the nuclear programme of the DPRK is kept under close and regular scrutiny within the European Union. The EU has clearly expressed its concern at the announcement on 11 February by the DPRK of its nuclear weapons activity. The EU has urged the DPRK to revoke, as soon as possible, its decision to withdraw from the six party talks and to allow the resumption of negotiations in order to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the crisis in the Korean peninsula. The EU also reaffirmed its strong support for the six party talks process and renewed its appeal to the DPRK to comply with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The EU and Asian partners reiterated this concern at the Asia-Europe Foreign Ministers meeting which took place in Kyoto, Japan, on 6-7 May 2005.At the seventh review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which took place on 2-17 May 2005 in New York, the EU also called on the DPRK to respect fully its international obligations in the non-proliferation field, in accordance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA. The EU further reaffirmed that it is firmly committed to contributing to a peaceful and negotiated solution to the DPRK's nuclear programme.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Following an initiative of the then Irish EU Presidency, member states at the April 2004 meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, agreed to submit individual reports to the Commission on their efforts towards implementation of the millennium development goals, MDGs. Reports were submitted by member states in the second half of 2004 and the Commission subsequently presented the Council with a package of communications outlining proposals for a consolidated EU contribution to the MDGs. These proposals set out three focal areas for a contribution to the UN summit to review the MDGs in New York in September next: financing for development, policy coherence and Africa.The General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting on 24 May 2005, adopted a number of conclusions on the following issues.  On volume of aid, a new collective EU target was agreed whereby member states which have not yet reached a level of 0.51% ODA-GNI undertake to reach that level by 2010. The new EU member states have agreed to reach a level of 0.17% ODA-GNI by 2010. In addition, member states undertake to achieve the 0.07% ODA-GNI target by 2015, while the new member states will strive to increase their ODA-GNI to 0.33% by 2015.  On policy coherence, the EU recognises the importance of non-development policies for assisting developing countries in achieving the millennium development goals. The EU will make a specific effort to promote and enhance policy coherence for development in the context of the global partnership for development under millennium development goal eight and in support of partner countries' own policies and in compliance with international obligations. Focus on Africa means the EU considers the development of Africa a priority and will strengthen its efforts to support African countries to reach the millennium development goals. The EU will strengthen its cooperation with the UN and other international partners to that end. The Union agreed to increase its assistance to Africa and will provide collectively at least 50% of an agreed increase in ODA resources to the African continent.Ireland participated actively in the discussions which led to the Council decisions. I very much welcome the outcome of the meeting. The rate of progress towards development is slower in Africa than in any of the other regions of the world. Ireland's primary aid focus has always been on Africa and this will continue to be the case. Over three quarters of all of the Government's spending on aid is directed to the world's poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa.The UN September summit is not only the first major progress review of the achievement of the MDGs, but is also a unique opportunity for the world to come together and agree on a collective response to the multiple needs, threats and challenges which we all face, ranging from extreme poverty, endemic disease and climate change, to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, genocide and civil war. As the world's largest aid donor, the EU has a major role to play in the achievement of the MDGs and in providing strong leadership towards their implementation. Following the Council's landmark decision on 24 May 2005, I believe that the Union is clearly showing its intention to provide that leadership.The GAERC conclusions of 24 May 2005 also underlined the primary responsibility of developing countries for their development and the crucial importance of national ownership for development-supported, comprehensive and coherent national poverty reduction strategies bold enough to meet the MDGs' target by 2015.Further details of the Council conclusions of 24 May 2005 may be seen at www.consilium.eu while the Commission communications of 12 April 2005 on speeding up progress towards the millennium development goals, financing for development and aid effectiveness, policy coherence for development, and the EU report on Millennium Development Goals 2000-2004: EU Contribution to the Review of the Millennium Development Goals at the UN 2005 High Level Event may be accessed on the website of the European Commission at www.europa.eu.int/comm/development/index_en.htm.

In addition, during the seventh Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on 30-31 May, I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in the region with the foreign ministers of Israel and Palestine. I hope to travel to the region later this year to meet the Israeli and Palestinian authorities and to encourage further movement in advancing the peace process. At present, it is clear that neither side has done enough to fulfil its commitments under the roadmap, and that progress towards a peaceful settlement has not been as rapid as would have been hoped. Ireland, the EU and the international quartet will continue to press both sides to implement the roadmap fully.

The budget for the bilateral programme in 2005 is €32 million, comprising support to a poverty action fund focused on supporting key social sectors, dedicated support to related sectors like education, health, as well as for reform in the justice, law and order sector and support to a number of districts as well as to a number of projects. A further €4 million is being provided for emergency and development activities, mainly through non-governmental organisations.Donor concerns about the pace of democratic reform in Uganda have been growing in the lead-up to presidential and parliamentary elections due to take place in 2006. These concerns focus on the slow pace of change to create space for a multi-party political system. Additionally, donors have raised concerns about the transparency of any moves to amend the constitution in order to remove the two-term presidential limit. While it is a matter for Ugandans to decide on constitutional change, I believe that the process must be fair and transparent if it is to command the confidence of the Ugandan people, as well as the international community.In recent months discussions have intensified between donor countries, including Ireland, and the Ugandan Government across a range of governance reforms with a particular emphasis on the multi-party issue. There has been a strong engagement at official level in Kampala and on 20 May I met the ambassador of Uganda to Ireland, His Excellency, Dr. Tomasi Sisye Kiryapawo. At that meeting, I clearly outlined the concerns of the Irish Government. I indicated that, as a signal that Ireland wants to see real progress on reform, the withholding of €2 million in development assistance is being considered.The situation is currently under review. I am continuing to maintain contact with my counterparts from other donor countries to encourage a coordinated approach. The United Kingdom withdrew €5 million sterling from its programme in Uganda earlier this year on account of similar concerns and other donor countries are also considering their position.

Under this agreement, which was endorsed by the European Council last December, Iran, inter alia, reaffirmed that it does not and will not seek to acquire nuclear weapons and committed itself to full transparency and cooperation with the IAEA. Iran, moreover, decided to voluntarily suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to invite the IAEA to verify and to monitor the suspension. The agreement further provided for negotiations on a long-term agreement, which will cover political and security issues; technology and cooperation; and nuclear issues. At the same time and in parallel the EU has engaged in formal negotiations with Iran towards a political dialogue agreement, PDA, and a trade and cooperation agreement, TCA. The suspension by Iran of those elements of concern in its nuclear programme is a necessary condition for these talks to take place.At the meeting of the IAEA board of governors last March, France, Germany and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement in which they gave their preliminary assessment of the negotiations with Iran. They indicated that the negotiations have allowed for an extensive exchange of views, notably on ways to provide objective guarantees that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes, as stipulated in the Paris agreement. The two sides have discussed long-term arrangements for cooperation between the EU and Iran in the political and security area, as well as in the economic and technological field. They have also explored the prospects for possible international cooperation in connection with Iran's nuclear programme. In reiterating their commitment to the negotiation process, France, Germany and the United Kingdom stressed that it is essential that confidence be maintained through the continued implementation in good faith of all aspects of the Paris agreement.In recent weeks, such confidence was undermined when Iran issued statements that suggested that it would recommence some activities covered by voluntary suspension. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in response, wrote to Iran and called for a ministerial level meeting, which took place on 25 May in Geneva. At a subsequent press conference, the UK's Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, commented that the two sides had a thorough discussion within the framework of the Paris agreement. He indicated that the European side would make detailed proposals to Iran by the end of July or the beginning of August, in the context of the Paris agreement remaining in force. During the meeting the European side again recognised Iran's rights under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, exercised in conformity with its obligations under the treaty, while Iran reaffirmed its commitment not to seek nuclear weapons.I met the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, on 2 May, at the NPT review conference in New York. The main subject discussed in this brief meeting was the Iranian nuclear programme. Dr. Kharrazi stressed the importance of nuclear power in providing for the future energy needs of his country and Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. I recalled Ireland's national position on nuclear power and reaffirmed the need for the Iranian nuclear issue to be addressed within the framework of the negotiations led by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in strict conformity with the Paris agreement. I underlined the belief that difficulties should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation and that when a solution was found on the nuclear issue this would open the way to making progress on other issues, which could only be beneficial for both sides.

As envoy, I am tasked with presenting the key elements of the Secretary General's In Larger Freedom report and conveying to the Secretary General, in confidence, the views and concerns expressed by UN members. This is being done to prepare for the summit taking place at the UN in September.Between now and the end of the year, I will attend also a number of EU related meetings including meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC; the informal meeting of EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs; European Council meetings scheduled for June, October and December and the UN General Assembly in September.I will, of course, continue to meet the British Government and all the parties associated with the peace process in Northern Ireland and travel, as required, in furtherance of the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. My programme of visits and meetings abroad until the end of the year is kept under constant review.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	307	At last November's European Union military capabilities commitment conference, Ireland indicated that it was prepared to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in the battlegroups initiative. As reported previously to the House, I have subsequently undertaken consultations with my counterparts from Sweden, Finland and Austria on the role that battlegroups, or rapid response elements as they are also known, can play in enhancing the EU's crisis management capabilities.An interdepartmental group, which includes representatives of my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Attorney General's office, is currently examining the policy, legislative and operational issues arising from Ireland's possible participation in rapid response elements. The work of the group is ongoing.I believe that this consultation process and the report of the interdepartmental group will enable the Government, in due course, to make a fully informed decision on Ireland's participation in rapid response elements.I would highlight that the value and importance of rapid response elements for dealing with crises at the request of the United Nations has been strongly emphasised by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. In his recent report on UN reform entitled, In Larger Freedom, Kofi Annan particularly noted the decision by the European Union to create standby battlegroups as a very valuable contribution to the efforts of the United Nations in this area.Participation in battlegroups would have no implications for our policy of military neutrality. Any Irish participation in an actual operation would remain a sovereign national decision, subject to the usual requirements of Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The Polisario are still holding 408 Moroccan prisoners, 14 years after the ceasefire between the two sides in 1991. A number of the prisoners are believed to have been held already for some years prior to 1991. They are visited in detention by the International Red Cross.Over 800 prisoners held by Polisario have been released in the last two years. The Government firmly believes that there is a compelling humanitarian case that all remaining prisoners, held by either side, be released immediately and without preconditions. This view has been strongly conveyed to the Polisario. During the Irish presidency of the EU last year, Polisario released 200 of the remaining prisoners of war. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, witnessed the release of the second group of 100 in June.The Government will continue to press all parties to meet their humanitarian obligations without further delay. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, raised this issue with Polisario's European representative at a meeting in Dublin in December 2004.At EU level, the Presidency wrote to the foreign ministers of Morocco and Algeria and the Secretary General of Polisario in March 2005, calling on them to meet their humanitarian obligations without delay.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and I share the widely held concerns about it. The person concerned was placed under a number of restrictions as a condition of his release from prison in 2004 at the end of the prison sentence which he had served. These restrictions include a prohibition on him leaving Israel, and on contacting the media and foreign governments. I understand the person concerned is awaiting the outcome of proceedings brought against him in December relating to breaches of the conditions under which he was released.The Government has consistently been of the view that the person concerned should not be subjected to the restrictions which were imposed and the government of Israel is aware of this position. However, the restrictions have been the subject of judicial review by the Israeli Supreme Court, which concluded that they are not incompatible with the Israeli Government's obligations in respect of its citizens. I do not think that there is any likelihood that the Israeli Government will overturn the court's decision. The Government will continue to monitor the situation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I welcome the fact that the withdrawal announced by the Israeli Government includes withdrawal from a number of settlements in the West Bank and I hope that this will mark the beginning of a comprehensive retreat from the occupied territories.The Government, together with Ireland's partners in the EU, has repeatedly reaffirmed its position that the proposed Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern West Bank is to be welcomed so long as it takes place in conformity with the conditions endorsed by the European Council in March 2004. The Council noted five elements which are essential to make a Gaza withdrawal acceptable to the international community: it must take place in the context of the roadmap; it must be a step towards a two state solution; it must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; there must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority; and Israel must facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza.The roadmap remains the best framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The members of the international quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United States and the Secretary General of the United Nations are all committed to the roadmap. This commitment has been repeatedly reaffirmed in the international quartet statements, most recently on 9 May in Moscow.At the seventh Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting, which I attended on 30 and 31 May, the EU Foreign Ministers and their partners in the region considered the future direction of the Middle East peace process. In our conclusions, which, for the first time in many years, were adopted by consensus, we recalled our attachment to the roadmap and underlined the central and unifying role of the quartet. We called for the rapid implementation of the roadmap and encouraged the parties to continue on the path of direct dialogue and negotiation in the fulfilment of the vision of two states, a safe and secure Israel, and a viable, sovereign, contiguous, democratic Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.Together with our EU partners, we will continue to work for a negotiated end to the conflict leading to two states, Israel and Palestine, living at peace within secure and recognised borders. There can be no substitute for political negotiations between the parties to the conflict, leading to a lasting political settlement.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Recent reports and incidents indicate that the security situation in Afghanistan remains volatile. On 1 June 2005, at least 20 people, including the Kabul police chief, Mohammed Akram, are believed to have been killed in a suspected suicide bomb attack on a mosque in Kandahar.On 7 May, a suicide bombing attack on an Internet café in Kabul resulted in the deaths of two Afghan nationals and one UN worker and the injury of a number of others. The publication, on 9 May, of a report in an international publication, which has since been withdrawn, about the desecration of the Koran sparked demonstrations in Afghanistan during which an estimated 13 people were killed. On 18 May, five Afghan nationals who were working on a counter-narcotics project were killed.The disarmament and demobilisation of irregular militia forces remains a key factor in building a secure environment in Afghanistan. The disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process, DDR, is proceeding well. Almost 50,000 militiamen have now entered the DDR process. It is estimated that less than 10,000 Afghan militia forces remain to undergo the programme by June 2006, the target date for completion of the DDR process. A large number of heavy weapons, twice the total number originally surveyed, have also been collected and secured in guarded compounds.The training of a reformed Afghan national army and police force, key elements in building a secure Afghanistan, also continues to make progress. It is important that the international community remains focused on supporting Afghanistan in the period ahead. The forthcoming parliamentary and local elections, which will take place on 18 September 2005, will undoubtedly present a considerable security, logistical and political challenge. More than 5,000 candidates have been nominated for election. A considerable number of women have been nominated, which is to be welcomed. In a report on 18 March 2005, UN Secretary General Annan estimated that more than $128 million was required to move forward with electoral preparations. The Government is currently considering the allocation of funding towards these elections. The European Commission will deploy an EU election observation mission, EOM, for the elections. In addition to this, the EU is providing €8.5 million toward the cost of the elections in addition to a further €3 million for the institutional development of the Afghan Parliament.The illicit narcotics industry in Afghanistan remains a serious problem which has implications for the security situation in Afghanistan as well as far-reaching consequences around the globe.Afghanistan's opium industry generates an estimated 60% of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, GDP, and Afghanistan produces 87% of the global opium supply. President Karzai has identified counter-narcotics as a priority for the Afghan Government and has introduced a number of important initiatives in this regard. These include a national counter-narcotics implementation plan, the appointment of a Minister for counter-narcotics, the creation of a cabinet sub-committee on counter-narcotics, and the establishment of a counter-narcotics trust fund, which will be jointly administered by the Afghan ministry of finance and the UN Development Programme, UNDP.Ireland, together with our EU partners, fully supports the Afghan authorities' uncompromising stance on the illicit cultivation of and trafficking in drugs. Over the past three years, Ireland has contributed €500,000 per annum to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, €300,000 of which has been channelled into counter-narcotics projects in the region. This contribution is likely to be substantially increased in the present year.It is clear that Afghanistan will face many challenges in the period ahead and will therefore continue to need extensive support from the international community. Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, will continue to sustain our support to Afghanistan in the period ahead.

I understand that the current position is that efforts to secure a deferral in any enforced departures among the Montserrat group continue to be made in the US Congress. Any decision on this is a matter for the US authorities but, as I have previously said, we very much appreciate the humanitarian impulse underlying the initiative taken in this case by Senator Edward Kennedy and his colleagues.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Negotiations on the future financial perspectives for the enlarged Union 2007 to 2013 have now entered an intensive phase. Negotiations, with a view to preparing discussions by Heads of State or Government, are being conducted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, supported by COREPER, with Finance Ministers contributing also through ECOFIN. The Presidency is conducting the negotiations on the basis of a "negotiating box" format which provides a framework for identifying issues on which there is broad agreement and for addressing also those remaining to be resolved.The first version of the negotiating box was considered by Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15 March and 26 April. A conclave of Foreign Ministers on 22 May discussed a second version of the negotiating box, issued on 19 May, which put forward possible solutions and options across expenditure headings and in relation to own resources. The Taoiseach is having discussions today in Luxembourg with the President of the European Council, Mr. Jean Claude Juncker. The next ministerial conclave, scheduled for 12 June, will consider and prepare a further revised version of the negotiating box for discussions by Heads of State or Government at the European Council on 16-17 June. Finance Ministers will also discuss the negotiations at their meeting on 7 June.The Government's approach to the negotiations is that the future financial framework should equip the Union adequately to meet the expectations of our citizens and the challenges of the years ahead while providing value for money for the EU taxpayer. As the Deputy is aware, the Government has consistently underlined the importance of respecting the October 2002 agreement on the Common Agricultural Policy. We have pressed for a fair outcome for our regions in terms of cohesion, while reiterating Ireland's commitment to solidarity with the new member states in this regard. The Government has also expressed our concern to limit the cost of any rebates and correction mechanisms.The Luxembourg Presidency has carried forward the negotiations in a very professional and skilful manner. However, it is not possible to predict at this stage whether agreement at the European Council on 16 and 17 June will be possible.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	At the end of last year, the Government announced that a White Paper will be published on the future of Ireland's official development assistance programme. This will be the first ever White Paper on the programme and it comes at a time when the resources allocated to development co-operation have reached very substantial levels.As a first step in the preparation of the White Paper, the Department of Foreign Affairs is engaged in a wide-ranging process of public consultation. At the beginning of this year, advertisements were placed in the national press seeking written submissions on the future of the programme. The deadline for the receipt of submissions was initially set for 30 April, but extensions have been granted to those organisations and individuals which have sought them and submissions are still being received. Complementary to the written submissions, I have also undertaken a series of public meetings in different locations around the country. To date, meetings have taken place in the following locations: 13 April — Limerick, 27 April — Waterford, 3 May — Athlone, 4 May — Galway, 10 May — Cork, 17 May — Tralee, and 24 May — Dublin. I plan to hold further meetings in a number of other locations in the coming months. Details of the dates and locations of these meetings will be announced when arrangements are finalised. I have attended all the public meetings to date to listen to the views offered from the floor and to answer questions. The meetings have been well attended, bringing together experts and non-experts for informed, lively and useful discussion. At all meetings, I have found that there is a genuine appreciation that this process of public consultation is being undertaken.Overall, the process of public consultation is proving to be very successful and I will be happy to report further to this House in the future, as the process continues.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 167 together.Issues at the heart of effective delivery of assistance to poor people in least developed countries include clear objectives, a well-articulated strategy for delivery and good oversight and accountability. As the Deputy will be aware, the central objectives of the Irish programme of development co-operation continue to be the reduction of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development. Meeting the basic human needs of some of the poorest people in the world and improving their access to food, water, health services, sanitation, education and employment are key goals of the bilateral development programme, of our interaction with multilateral institutions and of our engagement with and through NGOs.The main geographical focus of the bilateral programme is sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Within the framework of three-year country strategy papers, CSPs, Development Co-operation Ireland provides long-term development assistance to seven programme countries, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda and Zambia, as well as South Africa. In line with other donors, we operate in partnership with the Governments of these countries and agree our strategies with them to ensure that our interventions respond effectively to their development needs. We help to build up the capacity of these Governments to manage their own affairs, which in turn strengthens their sense of ownership of the whole development process. This more integrated and harmonised approach, focused on assisting poor countries to do things for themselves, is a major advance on the previous project-type engagement and has delivered positive and substantive results.It is of critical importance, when operating in an environment of dire poverty and the corruption frequently associated with it, to have robust processes for oversight and accountability in relation to the funding provided. The Development Co-operation Ireland programme provides this through a rigorous system of evaluation, monitoring and audit. All accounts and expenditure are audited. There is a strong, comprehensive monitoring process, which acts as a quality control on the programme. The evaluation approach allows for a forensic examination of interventions to measure effectiveness and identify lessons learned.I am satisfied that the auditing, evaluation and monitoring systems which we have in place ensure that the funding provided under our programme goes only to those for whom it is intended.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 170 together.The political and humanitarian situation in the Darfur region of Sudan remains a matter of the deepest concern for Ireland. The Government continues to use all avenues open to it to urge action in addressing the urgent humanitarian, security and political challenges which exist there. While the overall level of violence in Darfur has stabilised in recent months, the situation, as Secretary General Annan stated last week when visiting the region, remains unacceptable, with over 100,000 people having died as a direct or indirect result of the conflict and 2 million people forced to flee their homes. Sustained international pressure needs to be exerted on all the parties to honour their commitments, improve the security situation and achieve a speedy political settlement.The African Union's observer mission, AMIS, in Darfur is playing an extremely valuable role in addressing the security situation in Darfur. It has been demonstrated that where AMIS is deployed in Darfur, a marked reduction in violence follows. There is a clear need, however, to increase further the size of the AMIS mission, if the situation on the ground is to be fully stabilised and suitable conditions created for the safe return of internally displaced persons, IDPs, and refugees. I therefore welcome the recent decision by the AU to expand its mission from 3,200 to more than 7,700 personnel. The strong support evident at the donors conference held in Addis Ababa last week at which US$300 million was pledged to assist with the planned expansion of AMIS demonstrates the international community's confidence in the African Union's efforts to try to resolve the Darfur conflict.The External Relations Council agreed on 23 May that the EU should lend all possible support to AMIS's military, police and civilian efforts and a specific package of assistance, focusing on logistical and planning support, was outlined by High Representative Solana at the donors conference in Addis Ababa. Ireland was also represented at the Addis Ababa meeting and has pledged to provide additional financial support for the expansion of AMIS, subject to further discussion on details, as part of the overall EU package of support. I informed the UN Secretary General yesterday that we will be contributing an additional €1 million; it is intended that this further contribution will be earmarked for the humanitarian and human rights components of the AMIS mission. This will be in addition to the €500,000 for the humanitarian and human rights elements of AMIS which Ireland provided last year. An officer from the Permanent Defence Force is also serving as an EU observer with the AMIS mission, though his assignment will finish at the end of June 2005 and we are in a position to offer the services of a logistics planner at lieutenant colonel level for an expanded AMIS mission.The African Union is also playing a key role in efforts to achieve a political resolution to the conflict in Darfur. Peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria under African Union auspices between the Government of Sudan and the two Darfur rebel groups, SLM/A and JEM, are scheduled to resume on 10 June.In 2004, Ireland responded to the crisis in Darfur by providing €6.38 million in assistance to the region. This funding was delivered rapidly to assist the life-saving work of non-governmental organisations, UN agencies and the Red Cross family. Ireland's funding was utilised to provide food and essential non-food items to help families and individual s survive.The Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, Deputy Conor Lenihan, visited Sudan from 3-8 April. During his visit he met a wide range of UN representatives, including the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Jan Pronk. He also met Government Ministers, NGOs, the Red Cross, community leaders and regional leaders. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, witnessed the important work of the aid agencies at first hand and pledged that Ireland would continue to assist in meeting immediate emergency needs and also longer term development activities when possible. In his discussions with the Sudanese authorities, he stressed the importance of the restoration of peace and security in Darfur as soon as possible; the need for all parties to the conflict to negotiate in good faith and reach an early political agreement; and the need for the Government of Sudan to co-operate fully with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, especially that relating to the International Criminal Court.The visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to Sudan took place immediately before the major donors' conference on Sudan which was held in Oslo on 11-12 April. The conference pledged approximately €4.5 billion for Sudan up to 2007. While recognising that the peace agreement represents a new beginning for Sudan, participants emphasised the need to build on the agreement and to bring peace and stability to all of Sudan, including Darfur and the east of the country. At the Oslo conference, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, pledged €15 million to Sudan over the next two years. This funding will be used to meet immediate needs such as food security, return of the displaced and basic education and will also to begin to address the long-term development needs of the Sudan. To date this year the Government has approved funding of €2.6 million for emergency and humanitarian programmes in the Darfur region and south Sudan. These programmes are being operated by Irish and international NGOs and include nutrition, basic health care, water and sanitation, seeds and tools and assistance to internally displaced persons.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 88 and 156 together.As I reported to the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 25 May 2005, EU member states came to an agreement at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, on 24 May 2005 on a new threshold for official development assistance, ODA, for 2010 and 2015.The elements of the Council's agreement are as follows: member states, which have not yet reached a level of 0.51% ODA-GNI undertake to reach, within their respective budget allocation processes, that level by 2010, while those that are already above that level undertake to sustain their efforts; member states, which have joined the EU after 2002, and that have not reached a level of 0.17% ODA-GNI, will strive to increase their ODA to reach, within their respective budget allocation processes, that level by 2010, while those that are already above that level undertake to sustain their efforts; and member states undertake to achieve the 0.7% ODA-GNI target by 2015 while those which have achieved that target commit themselves to remain above that target; and member states which joined the EU after 2002 will strive to increase by 2015 their ODA-GNI to 0.33%.The Council's decision is part of the European Union's contribution to the preparation of the United Nations summit in September 2005 on the follow-up to the 2000 millennium declaration. The September 2005 summit is not only the first major progress review of the achievement of the millennium development goals, but is also a unique opportunity for the world to come together and agree on a collective response to the multiple needs, threats and challenges which we all face, ranging from extreme poverty, endemic disease and climate change to terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction, genocide and civil war. As the world's largest aid donor, the EU has a major role to play in the achievement of the millennium development goals and in providing strong leadership towards their implementation. Following the Council's landmark decision on 24 May 2005, I believe that the Union is clearly showing its intention to provide that leadership.Far from having opposed the European Commission's proposals to increase ODA, I fully supported the proposals on this subject which were adopted by consensus at the meeting of the Council on 24 May.On a national level, the Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% ODA-GNI for expenditure on ODA. The issue of how best to meet the target, and in what timeframe, is under ongoing review.

The May meeting is traditionally attended also by Ministers for Defence for an exchange of views on developments in European Security and Defence Policy. Moreover, the second day of the Council was devoted to development issues as is the practice once during each Presidency. I attended the Council, accompanied by the Minister for Defence and the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights.In the general affairs part of the meeting, the Presidency presented the first draft of the annotated agenda for the June European Council. Ministers will examine this in more detail at the next meeting of the Council on 13-14 June. The main external relations item on the European Council agenda is expected to be preparation of the EU position for the September high level summit at the United Nations. In this context, I briefed my colleagues on my most recent consultations in my role as special envoy for UN reform.Under the external relations agenda, the Council discussed a wide range of issues and adopted conclusions in relation to European Security and Defence Policy, Uzbekistan and Sudan. Foreign Ministers and Development Co-operation Ministers considered jointly the follow-up to the EU action plan on the Asian tsunami.Development Co-operation Ministers discussed the millennium development coals including the EU contribution to the high level event in New York in September 2005; the action programme against HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria 2007-11; and the revision of the development co-operation policy statement. Conclusions were adopted on the first two of these items.On the eve of the Council, the Presidency arranged a meeting of Foreign Ministers to discuss the future financial perspectives for the period 2007-13. We have entered an intensive phase of this very important negotiation. I emphasised our continued support for generous cohesion arrangements for the poorest member states, including in particular for our new partners. At the same time, I argued that our own regions should continue to receive appropriate assistance. I also used the occasion to stress once again that the October 2002 agreement on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy must be respected.Before attending the Council, I, along with the Minister for Defence and the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, met with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs for a detailed exchange of views on the agenda. As there did not prove to be sufficient time to consider fully the development issues at that meeting, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met the committee at its invitation on 25 May 2005 to debrief its members on the outcome of the GAERC.

I spoke by telephone to Mr. Hain shortly after his appointment to offer my congratulations and to arrange for an early meeting.I subsequently met Mr. Hain on 18 May in Dublin. This meeting was a valuable opportunity to consider the post-election situation in Northern Ireland, and to affirm our shared goal of securing the implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. We are both entirely at one on the need for an early and decisive response from the IRA and, in turn, a real commitment by unionism to inclusive power-sharing arrangements.Mr. Hain's previous political experience will undoubtedly stand him in good stead for his new post and the challenging task ahead. I greatly look forward to working closely with him in the same spirit of partnership that characterised my working relationship with his predecessor.I would like once again to pay warm tribute to Paul Murphy for his immense contribution to the peace process during his time as Secretary of State. Both his political acumen and his unfailing courtesy were appreciated by all those who worked with him and I wish him every success in his continuing career.Together with the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair, Mr. Hain and I will avail of all opportunities to engage with the political parties in the period ahead in an attempt to move the process decisively forward. I also hope to meet the Secretary of State within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference later this month.

Nevertheless, I am not aware of recent contacts of the nature referred to in the Deputy's question.My contacts with Sinn Féin since the beginning of the year included the meeting on 25 January when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I met Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness in Government buildings. Subsequently, in the course of a programme of events in Derry, I had an informal meeting with Martin McGuinness on 4 February. Finally, together with the Taoiseach, I met Gerry Adams in Washington DC on 16 March. All of these contacts were in the public domain and the Taoiseach and I have commented on them as appropriate.

The report was launched last week and is currently being studied in my Department. It provides a very useful overview of the human rights situation around the globe.The Government shares Amnesty International's concern for the effective promotion and protection of human rights globally. I have met Amnesty International since assuming my role as Minister for Foreign Affairs and my officials are in ongoing contact with Amnesty International regarding a wide range of human rights issues.In addition Amnesty International is represented on the Department of Foreign Affairs NGO standing committee on human rights. This committee provides a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between the Department and representatives of the NGO community.Furthermore, Ms. Irene Khan, the Secretary General of Amnesty International gave the key note address at the annual Department of Foreign Affairs NGO forum on human rights, which took place in Dublin last December. Officials in my Department are currently examining the Amnesty International Report in detail and will consider it in the context of their ongoing work in the field of human rights, both at EU level and at UN level.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Article 77 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 provides that a coastal state exercises over its continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural resources. It exercises these rights out to a maximum distance of 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, or further if the shelf naturally extends beyond that limit. Where the submerged prolongation of its land territory extends beyond 200 nautical miles, a state is required by Article 76 of the convention to submit information on the limits of its extended continental shelf to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf. Such a submission should be accompanied by technical and scientific data that support the claimed limits. The commission, which is composed of 21 scientific experts, considers the submission and then issues recommendations to the submitting state. The limits established on the basis of these recommendations are final and binding. These limits mark the boundary between the continental shelf of the coastal state and the international deep seabed "area", which is the common heritage of all mankind.Ireland claims a broad continental shelf which, in the Hatton-Rockall area to the west, extends more than 500 nautical miles from shore before reaching the deep seabed. Although a continental boundary agreement here was concluded between Ireland and the UK in 1988, this cannot bind Iceland or Denmark, in respect of the Faroe Islands, which both make overlapping claims. There are similar unresolved boundary issues in the Celtic Sea involving France and Spain. The State claims a further portion of extended continental shelf between these two areas, in the region of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, which has not been the subject of any dispute with another state.The terms of the convention require Ireland to make its submission to the commission within ten years of entry into force of the convention with respect to the State, that is, by 21 July 2006. However, the tenth meeting of the states parties to the convention, which took place in 2000, decided to extend the ten year period to May 2009 for all states that had ratified or acceded to the convention before 13 May 1999, the date on which the commission adopted its scientific and technical guidelines. However, the commission's rules of procedure prevent consideration by it of any submission in respect of a part of the continental shelf that is the subject of a dispute except with the prior consent of all the disputing parties.Work on the preparation of Ireland's submission began over ten years ago and extensive seismic and bathymetric surveys of the extended shelf claimed by Ireland were conducted on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in 1995 and 1996. Detailed consideration and analysis of this data followed and more recently the question of how to handle submissions for the two disputed areas of shelf has been the subject of two separate sets of consultations with the states concerned.Following the completion of work on Ireland's submission, the Government recently authorised me and my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to arrange for a partial submission in respect of the undisputed area of the extended continental shelf abutting the Porcupine Abyssal Plain to be made to the Commission. This partial submission was lodged with the Secretary General of the United Nations on 25 May last.Ireland's submission will be considered at the next session of the commission, which takes place at the end of August. A sub-commission of seven members will be established for this purpose. It is hoped that the commission's recommendations will be issued next year.The limits established on the basis of the commission's recommendations will enable the Government to designate up to an additional 39,000 km2 of seabed pursuant to the Continental Shelf Act 1968. Once designated, hydrocarbon prospecting and exploration may be licensed there.Ireland is the fourth country to make a submission to the commission, following upon submissions made by the Russian Federation in 2001 and by Brazil and Australia in 2004.

It would clearly be a matter of serious concern if funds intended to meet the needs of the Iraqi people had been diverted for other purposes, regardless of whether this took place before or after the overthrow of the previous Iraqi regime.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Government has consistently condemned the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma and the continuing abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in that country. Together with our EU partners, we remain acutely aware of, and gravely concerned about, the continuing house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, other opposition activists and a number of MPs elected in 1990. Aung San Suu Kyi, who will be 60 on 19 June 2005, has now been under house arrest since 30 May 2003. I am pleased to note that Aung San Sauu Kyi will be honoured by the city of Galway with the freedom of that city on the occasion of her sixtieth birthday.On 7 May 2005, the EU Troika of Foreign Ministers met the Burmese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. U Nyan Win, in the margins of the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, of Foreign Ministers in Kyoto, Japan. The Troika expressed concern about the situation in Burma and called on the Burmese authorities to enter into a constructive dialogue with the opposition National League for Democracy, NLD, other legitimate representative bodies and ethnic groups. The Troika also called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, and all political prisoners. The Troika further appealed to the Burmese authorities to establish permanent and sincere co-operation with the UN Secretary-General's special envoy on Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, the special rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Burma, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro and with all relevant UN agencies. The Burmese Foreign Minister undertook to consider the demands expressed by the EU.At the opening session of the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting on 6 May, European and Asian Foreign Ministers collectively expressed to the Burmese Foreign Minister, their concern at the situation in Burma and expressed the expectation that all restrictions on the democratisation process will be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity. Ireland was represented at the meeting by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche. The Minister urged the Burmese authorities to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. He also expressed Ireland's grave disappointment and concern that the Burmese authorities had failed to create the conditions for political parties to participate in the national convention, now in recess.On 14 April 2005, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights passed without a vote a resolution, introduced by the EU, and co-sponsored by Ireland, which criticised systematic violations of human rights in Burma, and called for the restoration of democracy and freedom for all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The resolution also called on the Burmese authorities to release unconditionally and immediately, all political prisoners, with particular emphasis on the elderly and the sick. It further called on the Burmese authorities to desist from arresting and punishing persons for their peaceful political activities.The Government's continuing goal, and that of the EU, remains the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations there and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 73, 79 and 80 together.Following the elections on 30 January, and lengthy negotiations between the parties, the new transitional Iraqi Government under Mr. Al-Jafaari was formed at the beginning of May. It includes representatives of all the major groups in the Assembly. It also includes six Sunni Ministers, despite the under-representation of the Sunni community in the assembly due to violence surrounding the election and a boycott of the election by Sunni parties.The political process mapped out in Security Council Resolution 1546 calls for the assembly to agree a new constitution by October, to be put to the people in a referendum, followed by new elections for a fully sovereign assembly and government in December.An international conference on Iraq will be held on 22 June, to focus international support for the new Iraqi Government and the reconstruction of Iraq. It will also enable Iraq to set out its priorities and plans for the work of reconstruction, for of course it is now for the Iraqi Government to take the lead role in directing these efforts. It has unfortunately been the case to date that economic and infrastructure reconstruction in Iraq has been greatly hindered by violence, including attacks on contractors.The security situation continues to give rise to serious concern. There has been a noticeable rise in insurgent violence over the last month, seemingly aimed at denying the new Government any political momentum. The attacks are aimed mostly at Iraqi security forces and officials, but also include large bomb attacks on Shia and Kurd community targets, such as markets and mosques, intended to try and spark civil strife.It has been estimated that some 600 Iraqis have been killed in these attacks in the last month. The Government does not have any means of its own of estimating casualty figures in Iraq, or of assessing the accuracy of the figures put forward by other parties. However the Government's view, which has been expressed clearly since the outset of the conflict, is that the use of military force should be kept to a minimum, and that every possible effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties. Attacks intentionally targeted at civilians, which unfortunately have been a very frequent occurrence in recent weeks, are completely unacceptable.The new Government faces serious and interconnected challenges: establishing effective administration and security forces; defeating a violent insurgency; constitution-making; and rebuilding the economy and infrastructure. A crucial overarching challenge is to engage the Sunni community and leaders fully in the political process, including the drafting of the constitution, despite their low representation in the assembly.The EU is supporting the Iraqi Government in these efforts, including, inter alia, significant support for reconstruction, training in Europe for police and criminal justice system officers, and expert support for elections. The EU has also offered Iraq expert assistance in the process of drafting the constitution. This is of course a sensitive area in any political system, and it is up to the Iraqis to decide if they wish to avail of such help.

Much of that controversy was due to fears at the time that jurisdiction over Rockall and similar rocks and skerries would be a crucial factor in establishing rights over mineral and other resources in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas. However, during the course of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place between 1973 and 1982, the Irish delegation played a leading role in securing agreement on a satisfactory legal regime applicable to islands. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at Montego Bay at the conclusion of the conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf."Article 121 (3) applies to Rockall. Ireland ratified the Convention on 21 June 1996. The United Kingdom acceded to the Convention on 25 July 1997. It is accordingly accepted by both states that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones.While the United Kingdom continues to claim jurisdiction over Rockall, this claim is not accepted by Ireland. Each country remains aware of the position of the other.

On 23 May, the initial report of the UN verification mission indicated that the mission had encountered no Syrian forces still in Lebanon. There were some areas still to be visited, and some remaining questions related to the exact demarcation of the Syria-Lebanon border, but broadly the report confirmed the full withdrawal of Syrian forces. Questions remain about the possible presence of Syrian intelligence elements in Lebanon, and the extent to which Syria will still try to exert a dominating influence in Lebanese politics.I welcome the withdrawal of Syrian forces, which is an important achievement. It removes a major impediment to the rebuilding of a fully functioning political society in Lebanon. However, it would be a mistake to assume that the most difficult problem is now solved. The divisions in Lebanese society are still very close to the surface, and the international community will have to remain focussed on Lebanon, and use great care in its efforts to support the political process there.The next stage of that process is now underway with the parliamentary elections, the first round of which took place on 29 May.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The Government is fully committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, and opposes, and seeks the elimination of, the practice of human trafficking. The importance of addressing trafficking in persons has been recognised by Ireland and our EU partners. Article 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits trafficking in human beings.In 2004 the EU adopted a council framework decision on combating trafficking in persons. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently preparing legislation which will criminalise trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation as provided for in the framework decision.The Council of Europe has recently concluded negotiations on a Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. This convention, which was opened for signature at the Third Summit of the Council of Europe in Warsaw on 16 May, aims to prevent and combat trafficking in people in all its forms, national or international, whether or not it is linked with organised crime.The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, at its ministerial meeting in December 2003 in Maastricht, endorsed an action plan against trafficking in human beings, and subsequently appointed an OSCE special representative, Helga Konrad, to assist in putting this plan into practice.Europol and the European Police College, CEPOL, organise courses on an EU-wide basis for police forces dealing with investigations into the trafficking of human beings. Gardaí working in the Garda National Immigration Bureau investigating the trafficking of human beings have attended such courses.Ireland is also a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in persons, especially women and children and smuggling of migrants by land, air or sea. The protocol on trafficking not only provides for measures to suppress trafficking, but also measures to protect the victims of trafficking.Through its participation at international fora such as the United Nations General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, CHR, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Ireland raises its concerns in cooperation with like-minded countries regarding these issues. As a member of the EU, Ireland coordinates with the other EU member states in these fora. At the recent meeting of the CHR in Geneva, Ireland made a national statement condemning the trafficking of people and welcoming the appointment in 2004 of a special rapporteur on trafficking in persons.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The political situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be characterised by slow progress towards completion of the transition process. The major priority remains the holding of national elections by no later than June 2006, as scheduled under the 2002 Sun City peace accords. It now appears likely that a decision will be taken by the transitional national Government in Kinshasa to defer the elections, originally due to be held this month, until either later this year or early 2006, in order to enable necessary legislative and administrative measures to be put in place. One positive development has been the adoption of a draft constitution by the transitional national assembly on 13 May 2005. The EU has welcomed adoption of the draft constitution which will now be submitted for approval in a referendum later this year.Substantial international support will be required for the holding of elections in the DRC which it is estimated could cost up to almost US$300 million to arrange. The EU has already committed itself to provide some €85 million in electoral assistance while Ireland, in principle, is prepared to consider making a contribution in support of the electoral process, once there is greater clarity as to the timing of the elections. A decision will also be taken closer to the elections as to whether the EU will participate in an electoral observer mission in the DRC, though nationally this is something which Ireland would strongly support.The continued existence of armed militias in eastern DRC also needs to be confronted, if the transition process in the DRC is to be successfully completed. MONUC is performing a vital role in seeking to reduce the threat posed by these militias and deserves the full support of the international community for their efforts, in conjunction with the DRC Government, to establish peace and security in the troubled eastern region. The strong and effective action which MONUC has taken to confront armed militias in the Ituri region is welcome. The EU has made clear its willingness to assist the UN in the reinforcement of MONUC's capabilities to enable it to carry out its essential tasks. It is also to be hoped that renewed efforts will be made by the DRC and Rwandan governments, in close collaboration with MONUC and the FDLR. The continued existence of armed militias in eastern DRC also needs to be confronted, if the transition process in the DRC is to be successfully completed.MONUC is performing a vital role in seeking to reduce the threat posed by these militias and deserves the full support of the international community for their efforts, in conjunction with the DRC Government, to establish peace and security in the troubled eastern region.

The EU has made clear its willingness to assist the UN in the reinforcement of MONUC's capabilities to enable it to carry out its essential tasks. It is also to be hoped that renewed efforts will be made by the DRC and Rwandan governments, in close collaboration with MONUC and the FDLR — Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda — to build on the latter armed group's important disarmament initiative of 31 March 2005 in which it expressed regret for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and undertook to complete a process of voluntary disarmament and repatriation to Rwanda by the end of June.The transitional national Government in Kinshasa has, of course, primary responsibility for re-establishing peace and security and effectively exercising its own authority throughout the DRC. Greater efforts are called for by the DRC Government in accelerating the creation of an integrated national army and police force and supporting the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, DDR, if a secure environment is to be created for the holding of national elections. The EU is actively collaborating with the transitional national Government in supporting the process of security sector reform in the DRC, including through deployment of the new EUPOL mission which will offer advice and mentoring to the integrated police unit, IPU, in Kinshasa, which the EU has helped establish. Ireland has contributed €75,000 towards the costs of establishment of the IPU. The EU is also in the process of deploying a second mission, EUS EC DRC, comprising a small planning team to advise key government ministries in the DRC on all issues related to security sector reform. The EU is also providing substantial financial support for the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, DDR, in the DRC.Ireland and its EU partners remain active in ensuring that international attention continues to focus on the serious situation regarding observance of human rights in the DRC. The EU played a key role in securing agreement on a consensus resolution adopted at the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva in April which condemns the ongoing serious violations of human rights throughout the DRC and calls upon the transitional national Government to do all that it can to end impunity as well as to cooperate fully with the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation into serious human rights violations carried out in the DRC since 1 July 2002.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	332	While Liberia has made remarkable progress since the comprehensive peace agreement of August 2003, it still faces the major challenges of a successful return to democracy and sustaining the peace process. Parliamentary and presidential elections are due to be held on 11 October 2005. This election will mark the return of Liberia to a constitutional democracy after 14 years of civil war. The registration process was completed last month, with 1.2 million people registering to vote in the 11 October poll. The cost of the elections is expected to amount to US$17.5 million and the EU has pledged €4.5 million in electoral support.President McAleese, accompanied by the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, visited Liberia on 14 December 2004 and met Chairman Bryant, the former United Nations Special Representative in Liberia, Mr. Jacques Klein, and the Irish battalion. Chairman Bryant visited Ireland in November 2004 and expressed his gratitude for the invaluable role that Ireland has played in Liberia. The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces visited the Irish battalion in February 2005.Ireland recently established a development co-operation office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, which is also responsible for the delivery of humanitarian and development support to Liberia. At the international donor conference on Liberia in February 2004, Ireland pledged €5 million from 2004 to 2006 towards the recovery and reconstruction needs of Liberia. To date, Ireland has committed €4.85 million of this pledge.The United Nations mission in Liberia, UNMIL, was established on 19 September 2003 by UN Security Council resolution 1509. The Irish contingent comprises a motorised infantry battalion of some 410 personnel, together with six additional personnel deployed at force headquarters. The Government is of the view that the deployment of UNMIL is critically important in supporting the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and for the political and economic recovery of Liberia. Our personnel have been widely commended for the professionalism of their work. Despite recent improvements in the security situation in UN-controlled areas, the Liberian peace process remains fragile. The situation is generally stable in Monrovia but less so in other areas. Sporadic outbreaks of violence in rebel strongholds highlight the need for a comprehensive process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. UNMIL has successfully completed its programme of disarmament, demobilisation, rehabilitation and reintegration, DDRR, for rebel groups which concluded on 31 October 2004.Due to the fact that the number of combatants disarmed greatly exceeded original estimates, the DDRR programme has encountered significant financial problems and an additional US$20 million is required for rehabilitation and reintegration of the additional numbers. Ireland has made a contribution of €1 million to the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation programme in Liberia. Significant strides have also been made in restructuring and reforming Liberia's police force and the USA is providing material and technical support to restructure and reform the army.In December 2004, the United Nations Security Council renewed its trade sanctions against Liberia, extending bans on timber exports and arms imports to the country for another year. The timber sanctions may be reviewed after six months. The ban on diamond exports was extended for six months. In March 2005, the UN panel of experts informed the Security Council that Liberia could not as yet meet the criteria for joining the Kimberley process, which certifies rough diamonds as legal for international sale. Security Council sanctions against the export of diamonds from Liberia are expected to remain in place until the country succeeds in joining the Kimberly process. The European Union also renewed article 96 measures against Liberia in December in line with the UN Security Council sanctions, as it was agreed that Liberia had not made enough progress in areas such as human rights, governance, tackling corruption, and the judicial system to warrant an easing of sanctions at this time.

At the same time, there is an emphasis that the assistance provided is both targeted and cost-effective. Projects and programmes are subject to regular review and evaluation from sectoral experts within the development co-operation directorate and by external consultants. They are also subject to review by the development assistance committee of the OECD.There is a range of management and accounting controls in place throughout the development aid programme. The aid programme has an active evaluation and audit unit, which carries out an annual series of evaluations of various programmes and projects. Within the various schemes through which the Department funds aid agencies, provision is made for evaluation and audit. The multi-annual programme scheme, MAPS, is the most significant funding scheme in terms of the amount of funds available to aid agencies. MAPS is an arrangement established with a small number of Development Co-operation Ireland's core NGO partners, with the aim of strengthening strategic and programmatic co-operation, and providing a more flexible and predictable funding framework for the NGOs to operate.A number of major exercises have been conducted in the past in relation to civil society and a key strategic evaluation of the MAPS scheme will be concluded before the end of the year. In addition to the management systems and requirements agreed between the aid agencies and Development Co-operation Ireland, there are a number of domestic requirements for aid agencies registered in most countries. In many cases, this includes requirements under the relevant Companies Acts, including lodging annual audits with the registrar of companies and publishing annual reports. The proposed charities legislation in Ireland should, while providing an enabling environment for charities, further strengthen the oversight of aid agencies.

The Government played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the UN Security Council. Security Council resolution 1495 of July 2003 recommended the acceptance by all sides of the "Baker II plan". This plan was drawn up by Mr. James Baker during his term as personal envoy of the UN Secretary General. The "Baker II" plan proposes a transitional period of four to five years during which Western Sahara would be self-governing under Moroccan sovereignty. At the end of five years, a referendum would be held giving residents a choice between independence, integration with Morocco or continued autonomy.The Government believes that these proposals represent the best way forward towards a negotiated settlement of the issue which fully respects the right to self-determination of the Saharawi people. Algeria and the Polisario front have indicated their broad acceptance of these proposals. Morocco continues to reject them. United Nations efforts to secure agreement between the parties, led by the Secretary General's special representative, continue with the strong support of the Government.The Government's position on recognition is that there is as yet no Saharan state that meets internationally established criteria for recognition. Such a step would in any event prejudge the outcome of the UN efforts, which, as I have noted, the Government strongly supports. As regards the question of mining and fishing rights, the key issue is that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. The principle that the interests of the peoples of non-self-governing territories are paramount, and that their well-being and development is the responsibility of their respective administering powers, is well established in the charter of the United Nations. It is developed further in UN General Assembly resolutions on the question of decolonisation and economic activities in such territories.In recognising the inalienable rights of the peoples of non-self-governing territories to the natural resources in their territories, the UN General Assembly has consistently condemned the exploitation and plundering of natural resources and any economic activities which are detrimental to the interests of the peoples of these territories and deprive them of their legitimate rights over their natural resources. The UN has, however, recognised the value of economic activities which are undertaken in accordance with the wishes of the peoples of those territories, and their contribution to the development of such territories. Exploration and exploitation activities that proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the Saharawi people would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to natural resource activities in non-self-governing territories. It would be inappropriate for EU assistance to be given to actions in violation of international law.

The White Paper will set out coherent, effective and sustainable policy priorities for the Government's official programme of development assistance into the future that accurately reflect both public and expert opinion, as well as best practice in the field.The Government remains committed to increasing the resources available for development co-operation, as evidenced by the three-year multi-annual commitment announced in the last budget. The aid programme is not static. It has evolved as it has expanded and that will continue into the future, guided by the White Paper.The report of the Ireland aid review committee and the White Paper are very different. The report of the Ireland aid review committee published in 2002 was a most valuable and useful document which remains valid today. The Ireland aid review committee was an independent committee of experts which made a wide range of valuable recommendations on the future of the aid programme. Many of those recommendations have been, or are being, implemented.The preparation of the White Paper provides an opportunity to engage in a broad public consultation regarding the future direction of the official development assistance programme. It will set out the principles which have brought us to where we are today and which will guide our efforts into the future. The official development assistance budget is public money. We want to ensure that the public are aware of how it is being spent and also that they have an opportunity to make their views known.The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target for expenditure on official development assistance. The issue of how best to meet the target and in what timeframe is under ongoing review. This is a separate question from the preparation of the White Paper, although the implications of any decision taken with regard to reaching the target will be reflected in the text.

Its varied and wide-ranging recommendations are best implemented on a phased basis. Many of the recommendations relate to issues of continuing importance which require ongoing action from all partners, in Government and the voluntary sector, at home and abroad. Considerable progress has already been made, with action underway on over two thirds of the report's recommendations.Overall policy is now, as recommended by the task force, the responsibility of my Department. The high priority that we attach to this issue is reflected in the establishment of the Irish abroad unit and the designation of staff to work exclusively on emigration issues. This is an important step and one which we are convinced is injecting a fresh momentum to advance progress on all of the important areas identified by the task force.Funding for emigrant services, which comprises the Díon fund for emigrant welfare in Britain, as well as direct funding from my Department to groups in the US, Australia and Ireland, is more than eight times greater now than it was in 1997. This year, funding for emigrant services has reached €8.273 million. This is the highest amount ever allocated and represents a 63% increase on 2004 funding.The higher level of funding for emigrant services in recent years has allowed us to increase very significantly our financial support to voluntary agencies which provide invaluable services to our vulnerable emigrants. These agencies are active in the critical areas identified by the task force of pre-departure services and, of course, advice and support for our community living abroad. They are also involved in assistance to emigrants who may be considering returning to Ireland, another important area examined by the task force.A particular priority continues to be the need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised Irish community abroad such as our older community in Britain and undocumented Irish people in the United States. Agencies involved at the front-line in supporting them received additional funding last year. The additional funding available for this year means that financial assistance in support of services that benefit our vulnerable emigrants will increase even more in the coming months.My Department will continue to maintain very close and regular contact with the front-line organisations that support our emigrants so as to ensure that the voluntary sector have an effective channel of communication to the Government. In this way, we can ensure that the needs of our emigrants continue to be accorded the highest priority and that our response is effective and is developed further in the period ahead.

These refugees are of Nepalese descent and Hindu, unlike the northern Bhutanese who are predominantly Buddhist. Many of the refugees were forced to sign so-called "voluntary migration certificates" when they were expelled, effectively forfeiting their rights to Bhutanese citizenship under the country's citizenship laws. They are now accommodated in seven camps in southeast Nepal administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.Although Bhutan and Nepal agreed in 1993 to set up a high level committee at foreign minister level to work towards a settlement of the refugee issue, little progress has been made. The committee last met from 19-22 May 2003, in Kathmandu, and agreed a report on the status of the refugees in only one of the seven camps. Furthermore, the UNHCR decided in October 2003 to phase out assistance to the refugees camps and promote local integration of the refugees in Nepal. This was due to the Government of Bhutan's refusal to allow UNHCR access to southern Bhutan to monitor the repatriation of refugees.Together with our EU partners, Ireland continues to urge the government of Bhutan to allow UNHCR such access. We also call upon the governments of both Bhutan and Nepal to invite the UNHCR to participate fully in monitoring a verification and appeals process for the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.In our national statement at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 11 April 2005, Ireland specifically raised the plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, and called for "a prompt, viable solution to the problems of this group, involving voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement". Together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to press the Government of Bhutan to accept the UNHCR as an independent monitor of verified repatriation for this refugee group.

A small number of reforms will require amendment of the UN Charter. The most significant of these is the proposed expansion of the Security Council.Article 108 of the charter states that an amendment to the charter must be adopted by a vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified, in accordance with their respective constitutional processes, by two thirds of the members, including by all the permanent members of the Security Council. It is therefore possible for a permanent member to prevent a change in the charter from coming into force. The permanent members of the Council are, like all 191 members of the United Nations, taking part in the preparatory process ahead of next September's crucial summit at the United Nations.The House will be aware that, at the summit, Heads of State and Government will seek to agree on reforms that will strengthen the system of collective security, to restore momentum to the achievement of the millennium development goals, to enhance the human rights function of the United Nations, and to reform its institutions and management structures. The House will be equally aware that it is a central priority for the Government to do what it can to promote the success of the summit.Discussions on Security Council reform are ongoing, and it would not be appropriate for me, particularly in light of my role as envoy of the Secretary General, to comment on the position of individual states. While the issue of Security Council reform is important, it should not, in the Government's view, overshadow other very important aspects of the reform agenda.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The Real ID Act was passed unanimously by the US Senate on 10 May 2005 and was signed into law by President Bush the following day. Among its provisions, the Real ID Act establishes minimum standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identity cards in order that they be eligible for use as federal identification. People applying for, or seeking renewal of, driver's licenses and official identity cards will need to prove their legal presence in the United States by showing official documentation such as proof of citizenship, a valid visa, or a pending application for asylum or protected status. Under the Act, states are required to introduce the necessary legislation over the next three years.The Act was prompted in part by the report of the 9/11 Commission, which was set up in the US in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and which recommended that standards be set for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification, such as driver's licenses. As the Deputy may be aware, the regulations for issuing driver's licenses vary from state to state, allowing undocumented people in some states to obtain driver's licenses, which are widely-accepted in the US as a means of identification.The impact of the new legislation cannot be foreseen at this time but clearly it could have an impact on numbers of undocumented Irish people for whom the driving licence is their main form of identity. Furthermore, it is likely to present difficulties for undocumented people who work in sectors of the economy, such as construction or home help, where the necessity to drive and possession of a driver's license are vital.On the broader front, there has been some positive progress on immigration reform. In a significant development on 12 May, Senators McCain and Kennedy, in co-operation with several of their colleagues in the House, published a Bill which would grant undocumented people an opportunity to regularise their status. I welcome this important, timely and very positive contribution to advancing the debate on this sensitive issue.The Deputy can be assured that the issues of our undocumented citizens and immigration reform have the highest priority for the Government. The Taoiseach and I raised the issue of the undocumented, as well as the issue of wider immigration reform, with President Bush when we met with him on St. Patrick's Day, and also on the Hill at that time. President Bush re-affirmed his commitment to work with Congress on immigration reform. The Taoiseach and I very much welcomed this commitment and emphasised the importance of addressing the situation of the undocumented in a positive and sympathetic way. Our priority in the period ahead will be to lobby strongly in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill and to encourage the White House to become actively involved in the immigration reform process.

Mr. Flood's role is to oversee the disbursement of Ireland's assistance and to ensure it is carried out in line with best international practice.Mr. Flood has briefed the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ahern, and myself on his findings and has submitted two interim reports. These reports provide information about the humanitarian situation in the affected areas and the progress of the national and international response to date. The reports also include recommendations as to how the Government's response to the tsunami can be developed in line with evolving needs. Mr. Flood's recommendations have been incorporated into the Government's overall tsunami response strategy. Mr. Flood will submit a final report following his next visit to the region, which is scheduled for July.While the Government does not have a permanent presence in Aceh, several assessment and monitoring missions have been made to the region by officials from Development Co-operation Ireland. With regard to Irish NGOs in the region, Concern has a number of Irish personnel on the ground, as have the Irish Red Cross and Hope International. Trócaire is in the process of opening a regional office in Jakarta and some of its Irish personnel will travel to Aceh province from time to time. In addition, a number of Irish missionaries are also working in the region.

It essentially refers to effective military units that are capable of stand-alone rapid response operations. Unfortunately, the use of the term can create a misleading impression of what the European Union is actually seeking to achieve in facilitating the establishment of stand-alone units to respond in crisis management contexts. I consider that the term, "rapid response elements", by which battlegroups are also known, reflects more accurately the role these units are intended to fulfil.The value and importance of rapid response elements for dealing with crises at the request of the United Nations has been strongly emphasised by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. They could provide valuable support to the UN in crisis management and be used to respond to situations similar to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 where the deployment of an EU force contributed greatly to restoring stability and thereby alleviating a situation of great humanitarian distress.The EU and the United Nations are natural partners in the field of peacekeeping and crisis management. The UN is increasingly looking to regional organisations, such as the European Union and the African Union, to take on peacekeeping missions. Such missions, while mandated or authorised by the UN Security Council, would be carried out by the regional organisations themselves. This development was highlighted by Kofi Annan during his visit to Dublin in October 2004 and has been the subject of discussion between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UN Secretary General.In his recent report on UN reform entitled, In Larger Freedom, Kofi Annan particularly noted the decision by the European Union to create standby battlegroups as a very valuable contribution to the efforts of the United Nations in this area. Overall, he welcomed the development of regional rapid reaction capability and called for greater co-operation between regional organisations and the United Nations.

The European Union and the United Nations are in close consultation on developing their cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security.In the discussions taking place in New York on the four clusters of proposals contained in the Secretary General's, In Larger Freedom, report, the EU has voiced support for most of the key recommendations. These include,  inter alia, measures to ensure the attainment of the millennium development goals, the establishment of a peacebuilding commission to assist states emerging from conflict to make the transition to peaceful development, and reform of the UN’s human rights machinery. Many of the recommendations in the Secretary General’s, In Larger Freedom, report are drawn from the report of the Secretary General’s high-level panel on threats, challenges and change, which itself reflected key elements of the EU’s contribution to the work of the panel, drafted and agreed during Ireland’s EU presidency.The European Union, both at the United Nations in New York and in multilateral fora, has engaged in an active policy of outreach with other major regional groups, in support of the Secretary General's, In Larger Freedom, agenda. Within the past week, the EU has discussed UN reform and the preparation of the September summit with its Latin American partners at the EU-Rio group meeting and its Mediterranean partners at the seventh Euro-Mediterranean Ministers' meeting. I was present at both meetings, which I addressed in my capacity of envoy of the UN Secretary General.The European Union and its member states have a major role to play in ensuring that the developed world plays its part in the achievement of the millennium development goals. EU Development Ministers agreed on 24 May to new official development assistance or ODA volume targets, which, inter alia, commit the pre-accession 15 members of the EU to reaching the target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA by 2015, and the ten member states that acceded in 2004 to reaching 0.33% by that date. They also agreed to an interim target of 0.56% by 2010 for the European Union as a whole. This agreement will ensure that the EU fulfils its side of the bargain struck at the Monterrey conference on financing for development in 2002, when the developed countries committed themselves to increase funding and the developing countries committed themselves to good governance and respect for human rights.The European Union presidency intends to reach formal agreement by way of a declaration at the European Council later this month on the broad range of EU support for the Secretary General's reform agenda and the preparation of the summit. The European Commission has been actively engaged in the development of a coherent policy on cluster one, or development aid, issues and has made a number of useful proposals for EU action in support of a number of areas on the September agenda, including human rights, peace building, environment, sanctions, small arms and the institutional strengthening of the UN.One aspect of reform where the European Union does not have a Common Position is that of reform of the Security Council, where, as the House will be aware, sharply diverging positions among partners have prevented the emergence of a shared EU position. The EU, accordingly, does not pronounce collectively on this issue. However, this has not impaired the capacity of the EU to address actively the broad range of UN reform measures currently under discussion. It should not be allowed to overshadow other very important elements of the reform agenda, or prevent actions by the EU in support of the summit outcome.

This arrangement was calculated to avoid any erosion in the accountability, as regards the timeliness or quality of replies, arising under the parliamentary question system since the health boards were abolished.The executive recently established a parliamentary affairs division to act as a central contact for all Oireachtas requests relating to matters within its statutory remit. A key function of the division is to monitor, throughout the executive's national directorates and administrative areas, the timeliness of replies and to follow-up immediately where a reply has not issued within 20 working days of receipt of the referral.It is my view, shared by the executive, that it should endeavour to give all available information and possible assistance to Oireachtas members as circumstances may permit at the time of reply. I recognise that the subject matter of questions can differ greatly in their detail and complexity. Also, it may not always be possible for a public body to give all information sought or a definitive reply within a particular time. The guiding principle, however, must be to provide the maximum assistance possible. This is an area which merits ongoing attention between my Department and the executive. In that regard, the establishment of the new division will enable the executive to centrally monitor, and be held accountable for, the service provided to Oireachtas members. My Department is currently working with the executive on the finalisation and early implementation of arrangements to further enhance the capabilities of the executive to provide an information service to Oireachtas members.I am keen to ensure that the executive provides a high quality service to members of the Oireachtas and I will shortly be making regulations under section 79 of the Act regarding the conduct by the executive of its dealings with members of either House of the Oireachtas.

The activity figures refer to total procedures carried out on an inpatient basis to patients discharged in each of the specified years from 1998 to 2004, inclusive, from all publicly funded acute hospitals. Day cases are not included. Data for 2005 is not yet available. The data are derived from the hospital inpatient inquiry, HIPE, system. The figures indicate that the numbers of recorded inpatient procedures carried out in publicly funded acute hospitals have more than doubled since 1998. It should be noted that approximately 50% of the increase between 2001 and 2002 can be attributed to a provision in the HIPE system introduced in 2002 to allow recording of up to ten procedures compared with a maximum of four for data prior to 2002.As indicated, day case work, much of which is procedure-based, is not included in the table. There has been a 180% increase in day case activity over the period 1998 to 2004.The second column, which indicates inpatient base price, refers to the average cost per inpatient discharge based on the 32 publicly funded acute hospitals which participate in the casemix programme. Casemix is a method of hospital funding which quantifies hospital outputs by classifying each patient into a specific resource group. Individual procedures are not costed and the data cannot be used to estimate cost per procedure or total cost for all procedures.

Relevant information is available in respect of companies liable to corporation tax which are in the micro-enterprise category because they have no more than ten employees and their total income before capital allowances does not exceed €2 million. Such information is also available in respect of companies which are in the small and medium sized enterprise category because they have no more than 250 employees and their total income before capital allowances does not exceed €50 million. I propose to outline the corporation tax liability of companies in the two categories in question. The most recent figures relate to the accounting periods ending between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003. During that time, companies in the micro-enterprise category had a corporation tax liability of €169 million and companies in the small and medium sized enterprise category had a corporation tax liability of €509 million.Foreign direct investment companies are not identified on the records of the Revenue Commissioners in a manner that enables the information sought by the Deputy to be provided.

The code of practice issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments provides guidelines on how the appeals process should work, including timescales for the submission of appeals and complaints, the issuing of acknowledgements and the notification of decisions and explanations.The appeals procedure adopted by the Public Appointments Service is a three-tier process. It involves a review by the recruitment manager in the first instance. In reviewing a case, the recruitment manager may consult the relevant interview or selection board. The recruitment manager may uphold or change the original decision. If the candidate is not satisfied with the decision taken at the first review, he or she may appeal the decision and the case will be referred to a senior manager at assistant principal or principal level within the recruitment unit who has not been directly associated with the original decision. This manager will review the basis for the decision and the underpinning rationale. He or she may discuss it with the recruitment manager, the public appointments representative at the interview or selection board and the board itself. The manager may overturn the original decision, if appropriate.A candidate who is not satisfied with the response at the second layer of the appeals process may appeal to a decision arbitrator, who is a person at a senior level unconnected with the selection process. The arbitrator will review all documentation relating to the recruitment process to ensure that the principles set out in the code of practice for recruitment have been followed. The arbitrator will confine the consideration of the appeal to the content of the original information submitted by the candidate. The decision of the arbitrator is final.I cannot comment on the specific case for which details have been supplied as I understand it is the subject of an appeal that is still in progress. The appeal process is a matter for the Public Appointments Service as set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.

State-owned properties have been identified in a number of other locations including Athlone, Sligo, Na Forbacha and the Curragh. In a small number of locations, the possibility of renting existing or new buildings under construction or with planning permission is being pursued. Such locations include Kilrush, Listowel and Carrick-on-Shannon. While prices have yet to be agreed, the process of acquiring sites in several other locations is at an advanced stage.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Capital allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of certain qualifying private hospitals. The Health Service Executive, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, must certify that a hospital that wishes to qualify contains minimum facilities, meets capacity requirements and makes available not less than 20% of its capacity for the treatment of public patients. The expenditure can be written off over seven years, at a rate of 15% per annum over the first six years and 10% per annum in the seventh year.Companies, the trustees of a trust, individuals involved in the operation and management of the hospital and property developers are excluded from the scope of the capital allowance regime for private hospitals. That is necessary to ensure EU agreement to the scheme from a state aid perspective. Allowances are, therefore, only available to other individual investors investing in private hospitals. As passive investors, such individuals are subject to restrictions on the amount of allowances they can set sideways against non-rental income. Allowances must be set against rental income. If the allowances exceed the rental income, the amount that can be set against the individual's non-rental income in any one tax year is restricted to €31,750.The source of an investor's funds or the proportion of equity and loan finance does not affect the amount of capital allowances that can be claimed in a particular case. Rather, the value of the capital allowances will depend on the construction costs incurred. Allowances are only available in respect of the costs incurred in constructing the building. There are no allowances for the cost of acquiring the site or other non-construction costs such as marketing and selling the completed building. Therefore, buildings which qualify for capital allowances are often marketed on the basis that they will qualify for 80% or 90% relief, for example. Such percentages are a reflection of the cost of site acquisition and other non-construction costs not qualifying for capital allowances.Finally, the potential value of capital allowances to an individual investor depends on the detailed arrangements applying in a particular case. It depends especially on that individual's share of the construction expenditure incurred, calculated at the individual's marginal rate of tax at 42%. It will also depend on the individual's circumstances, such as his or her capacity to absorb the allowances as they come on stream over the seven-year write-off period. If the individual has insufficient income against which the write-off can be made, the unused allowances have to be carried forward and set against rental income in future years.

In the case of two of the six successful applications, the capacity involved has not been availed of yet. The terms of the scheme dictate that capacity granted can only be used by the successful applicants or by an immediate relation of theirs. It is not, therefore, open to any other party to assign it to a vessel. Under current licensing policy, capacity which was off-register on 1 January 2004, and this includes capacity granted under the lost at sea scheme, must be brought back onto the fishing boat register by 31 December 2005, otherwise the entitlement will be lost.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 147 together.When launching the ports policy statement in January 2005, I indicated that one of the key challenges ahead was the timely provision of adequate in-time port capacity. I noted that the internal resources of our commercial ports are not sufficient in general to fund large-scale infrastructure projects. I said this represented a significant challenge in view of the need for additional capacity at our ports over the coming years, particularly to cater for the growth in unitised trade. I indicated that the Department would consult with the commercial ports concerned to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement.As an initial step, the Department has sought and received information from the commercial ports, which handle unit load cargo, on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond, and whether the ports see these being funded from their own resources or in partnership with the private sector. The new policy framework encourages all port sector stakeholders to address capacity provision. Drogheda Port Company has submitted information on its proposal for the development of a new deepwater port at Bremore in its response to the information request from the Department in relation to port capacity. The timeframe for the proposed development and the preparation of a detailed business plan are matters for Drogheda Port Company in the first instance. The Department has also received information on proposals for the provision of additional unitised port capacity ranging from Greenore Port to Shannon Foynes Port Company.I cannot say at this stage which projects will meet the national capacity requirement. The new policy framework encourages all port sector stakeholders to address the issue of capacity provision. The Department intends in the near future to procure independent assistance from consultants to refine the criteria to be used for project evaluation, to draw up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals and to subsequently evaluate and prioritise the projects submitted as a basis for the Department's recommendation to Government. The Government expects that the port companies, as commercial entities, should be capable of funding their operations and infrastructure requirements without relying on Exchequer support. The port companies are, therefore, encouraged to seek financial assistance from other avenues such as private sector investment within ports.Proposals for capacity provision for unitised trade at the ports concerned, including Dublin and Drogheda, will be considered as part of the above process. Dublin City Council informed the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in March 2005 that it had adopted the Dublin City Development Plan on 14 February 2005 and the plan came into effect on 14 March 2005. The council stated that the policies and objectives in regard to Dublin Port set out in the development plan, include the preparation of a plan for that part of Dublin Bay, from and including North Bull Island and the South Wall and up to and including Sandymount, Merrion Strand and Booterstown and also concentrated on the port area. The plan will identify and determine the role of that part of the bay as an economic, amenity, recreational, environmental and ecological resource. The council indicated that its policy is to support the continued development of Dublin Port but that any such development would have to be considered inthe light of a plan being prepared and any material change arising from that plan being incorporated in the Development plan by way of variation.

Issues arose concerning proof of ownership of the area in question. These are being actively pursued by the State's legal services, acting on behalf of the Department, and Dublin Port Company's legal advisers. If it is established that the area in question is owned by the Port Company, the matter would fall to be dealt with under sections 10 and 13 of the Foreshore Act 1933. A full assessment of the likely effects on the environment of the proposed development would fall to be undertaken as an integral part of the Department's further consideration of the proposal.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Government's programme involves the relocation of the Department's headquarters to Cavan, the seafood and coastal zone functions to Clonakilty and the maritime safety directorate and the Irish Coast Guard to Drogheda. In addition, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is relocating to Clonakilty, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, to Dundalk and the Central Fisheries Board, CFB, to Carrick-on-Shannon.Physically relocating people depends on providing accommodation in the decentralised locations and this is a matter for the Office of Public Works, OPW. The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, has set out a timetable of late 2006 for facilities in Drogheda and early 2007 for completion of Department and BIM facilities, in Clonakilty. SEI's move to Dundalk is scheduled for early 2007. The Department is working closely with the OPW towards delivering on this schedule. The DIG has not yet set a timetable in regard to Cavan and Carrick-on-Shannon. However, we are also progressing the moves to these locations.The Department and its agencies already have a well-established decentralised dimension with staff and services based in 25 locations right around the country. Given the property situation it has not yet been possible to relocate any of our staff under the Government's decentralisation programme.However, the Department is progressing preparations for staff transfers both internally and with other Departments, in advance of full physical relocation. In this regard the Public Appointments Service, PAS, has advised there are 140 expressions of interest for the 90 Department posts in Clonakilty and 36 for the 94 BIM posts. There are 71 expressions of interest for the 47 Drogheda posts and 176 for the 378 Cavan posts. A further 59 people have expressed interest in the 39 SEI posts in Dundalk, while 45 are interested in the 62 CFB posts in Carrick-on-Shannon.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The task force on policy regarding emigrants produced an excellent report which provides us with a very valuable framework for action. Its varied and wide-ranging recommendations are best implemented on a phased basis. Many of the recommendations relate to issues of continuing importance which require on-going action from all partners, in Government and the voluntary sector, at home and abroad. Considerable progress has already been made, with action underway on over two thirds of the report's recommendations.Overall policy is now, as recommended by the task force, the responsibility of my Department. The high priority that we attach to this issue is reflected in the establishment of the Irish abroad unit and the designation of staff to work exclusively on emigration issues. This is an important step and one which we are convinced is injecting a fresh momentum to advance progress on all of the important areas identified by the task force.Funding for emigrant services, which comprises the Díon fund for emigrant welfare in Britain, as well as direct funding from my Department to groups in the US, Australia and Ireland, is more than eight times greater now than it was in 1997. This year, funding for emigrant services has reached €8.273 million. This is the highest amount ever allocated and represents a 63% increase on 2004 funding.The higher level of funding for emigrant services in recent years has allowed us to increase very significantly our financial support to voluntary agencies which provide invaluable services to our vulnerable emigrants. These agencies are active in the critical areas identified by the task force of pre-departure services and advice and support for our community living abroad. They are also involved in assistance to emigrants who may be considering returning to Ireland, another important area examined by the task force.A particular priority continues to be the need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised Irish community abroad such as our older community in Britain and undocumented Irish people in the United States. Agencies involved at the front-line in supporting them received additional funding last year. The additional funding available for this year means that financial assistance in support of services that benefit our vulnerable emigrants will increase even more in the coming months.My Department will continue to maintain very close and regular contact with the front-line organisations that support our emigrants so as to ensure that the voluntary sector have an effective channel of communication to the Government. In this way, we can ensure that the needs of our emigrants continue to be accorded the highest priority and that our response is effective and is developed further in the period ahead.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is the most universal of all of the multilateral instruments in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, came into force in 1970. The treaty has been reviewed at five-year intervals to assess progress under its three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.The seventh NPT review conference took place from 2 May to 27 May 2005 at the United Nations in New York. During the general debate, I delivered a statement on behalf of Ireland, the full text of which is available on the Department's website. The Government is deeply disappointed at the outcome of the conference, which it feels is a missed opportunity for the international community to tackle together key threats to global peace and security and to agree an effective collective response.Failure of NPT review conferences to reach a substantive result is not without precedent in the 35-year history of the treaty, but it is all the more worrying, given the scale of the challenges that have threatened to undermine the authority and credibility of the non-proliferation regime and risk its further erosion. The challenges remain to be tackled and we must work with our partners in the EU and other groups to find a way to make progress.The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in addressing the current situation, has stressed the need for leadership and pointed to the forthcoming meeting of heads of state and government in New York in September as a crucial opportunity to show such leadership. He has called upon them publicly to break the deadlock on the most pressing challenges in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and to take concrete steps to revitalise the NPT.The Government believes that states parties to the NPT must respond to the Secretary General's call and now seek to identify ways that the NPT regime can be further strengthened. The NPT is now more than ever of tremendous importance to the achievement of international peace and security. As I noted in my address, our success in halting the erosion of the non-proliferation regime will be an acid test of the effectiveness of the entire multilateral system. This is a fight we, for our own sake and that of future generations, cannot afford to lose.With respect to my meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, this took place at the latter's request on the second day of the NPT review conference. The main subject discussed in this brief meeting was the Iranian nuclear programme. Dr. Kharrazi stressed the importance of nuclear power in providing for the future energy needs of his country and Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The Minister recalled Ireland's national position on nuclear power and reaffirmed the need for the Iranian nuclear issue to be addressed within the framework of the negotiations led by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in strict conformity with the Paris Agreement. I underlined my belief that difficulties should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation and that when a solution was found on the nuclear issue this would open the way to making progress on other issues, which could only be beneficial for both sides. The two of us also briefly discussed the UN Secretary General's reform proposals and my role as UN envoy. Dr. Kharrazi stated Iran has been following the matter closely. He believed it was an important mission and wished the Minister every success with his task.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 162 and 168 together.It is generally agreed that the 60-year old structure of the United Nations Security Council, which derives from the immediate post-war situation, is not in accord with today's realities. There are, however, sharply divergent views on how the structure should be reformed.The high level panel on threats, challenges and change that reported to the UN Secretary General in December 2004 on measures to enhance collective security was itself unable to agree on a recommendation for reform of the Security Council. Instead it put forward two models for reform: model A, which would extend the membership in both categories, permanent and non-permanent, and model B, which would retain the current permanent members and would, in addition, create a new category of member, elected for four-year renewable terms.The Secretary General, in making his own recommendations for reform of the UN generally in his report, In larger Freedom, did not recommend either of these models to the membership, stating that reform of the Security Council was a matter for UN members themselves. However, he recorded his agreement with the factors which, according to the high level panel, UN members should take into consideration in deciding on a reform of the Security Council: states that contribute most to the United Nations financially, militarily and diplomatically should have an increased involvement; the council should be more representative of the broader membership, especially of the developing world; the effectiveness of the Security Council should not be impaired; and the democratic and accountable nature of the body should be enhanced.The Secretary General asked members to reach a decision before next September's summit, preferably by consensus, but if necessary by a vote of the General Assembly. A change in the charter of the United Nations requires the assent of two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly, and takes effect when ratified by two-thirds of the members, including all the permanent members of the Security Council.Four states with aspirations to permanent membership, Germany, Japan, India and Brazil, have recently circulated a draft resolution providing for an increase in the membership of the Security Council to 25, including six new permanent members. A group of states opposed to this approach, the Uniting for Consensus group, have put forward a counter proposal that would involve the creation of ten new elected members, distributed among the regions, who would serve for two or three years and could be re-elected with the approval of their regional groups. This arrangement would offer the possibility of extended or very frequent membership of the Council for certain states, with the agreement of their regional groups.The Government, along with other governments, is currently the merits of the different proposals that have been put forward. It will wish to ensure, in so far as it can, that whatever new structures are adopted will be in the interest of the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. It will also wish to ensure such an agreement preserves the possibility for smaller countries such as Ireland, which make substantial contributions to the work of the UN to serve on the Security Council at reasonable intervals.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	391	There is no internationally recognised system for ranking the severity of humanitarian crisis situations around the world, neither is it the policy of the Government to draw up a league table of countries deemed guilty of the worst human rights abuses. However, it is clear that there is a strong inter-relationship between conflict, the abuse of human rights, food insecurity and poverty. Conflict is exacerbated by poverty, inequality and exclusion. Most wars occur in poor countries and conflicts impact on the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly women and children. Furthermore, food security is undermined by the effects of conflict.Nineteen of the 20 countries ranked lowest on the UNDP's human development index for 2004, which takes into account life expectancy, education levels and per capita GDP, are in Africa. The only non-African country among these 20, at 158 out of a total of 177 countries, is East Timor. Ireland’s programme of development assistance is primarily focussed on the African continent. This programme addresses issues related to poverty, including conflict and food security. This assistance is delivered through a number of channels, directly, through our embassies in a number of African countries and, indirectly, using UN agencies, NGOs and other international organisations. East Timor is also one of Ireland’s priority programme countries for development assistance.As well as directly assisting many of the poorest countries in Africa, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security through our membership of the EU and the UN. During the Irish Presidency of the EU, we were heavily involved in major conferences, including to consider post-conflict reconstruction in Liberia and Iraq and to highlight the appalling situation in Darfur, Sudan. Ireland has recently opened a development office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, which will oversee funding programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia, two countries which are emerging from conflict. A major component of funding in these countries has been in support of UN programmes to assist in the recovery process.In addition to our support to emergency and recovery operations, Ireland will contribute €47 million in 2005 to the long-term work of UN agencies which seek to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development. Ireland's key partner agencies include the UN development programme, UNICEF — UN children's fund — the High Commissioner for Refugees, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN population fund, each of which contributes, within its own specific mandate, to the ongoing efforts of developing countries.If we are to break the cyclical nature of food insecurity and conflict in Africa and elsewhere, the underlying structural problems affecting poverty and stability must be addressed. Ireland has strong development partnerships with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as with East Timor. Through these partnerships, Ireland fully engages with the governments, donors, EU and UN agencies on the basis of poverty reduction strategy plans. The PRSPs outline how each country prioritises resources and policies with the objective of reducing poverty. These programmes contain a strong governance element throughout to assist in the building of democratic structures, the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights.The EU is strongly committed to implementing the UN millennium declaration and the millennium development goals. In this regard, the General Affairs and External Relations Council on May 24 decided on a package of MDG-related measures. These include significant increases in member states' development assistance between now and 2015, measures on policy coherence for development and a special focus on Africa. These actions will help ensure that the EU is in a position to offer leadership at next September's UN summit on the MDGs and thus enhance the possibility which this unique event provides for the world community to agree on a collective response to the multiple needs, threats and challenges which we all face, ranging from extreme poverty, endemic disease and climate change to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, genocide and civil war.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, immigration has become a highly sensitive and divisive issue in the United States. There is, in particular, a widespread and strongly held view in Congress that an amnesty for the undocumented should not be on the agenda. Members who have visited Washington in recent times will have come away with this clear message. However, there have been positive developments recently. In a significant development on 12 May, Senators Kennedy and McCain, in co-operation with several of their colleagues in the House, published a Bill which would,  inter alia, provide a way for the undocumented to seek the regularisation of their status. The Government has warmly welcomed the Bill. As with all legislative proposals in the US, the Kennedy-McCain initiative will have to be considered in detail by Congress, and we can anticipate a vigorous debate in this regard.The issue of our undocumented has the highest priority for the Government. The Taoiseach and I raised this issue, as well as that of wider immigration reform, with President Bush when we met him on St. Patrick's Day, as we also did on Capitol Hill at that time. The President re-affirmed to us his willingness to work with Congress in advancing reform.Our priority in the period ahead will be to lobby strongly in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill, and to encourage the White House to become involved in support of the reform process. It is not necessary to have a discussion with my EU colleagues in this regard. If this should be seen to be helpful at any stage, I will have it raised in the first instance at the regular meetings of EU ambassadors in Washington.

The insurgency has, to date, claimed approximately 10,000 lives. The rebels are fighting to abolish the constitutional monarchy and establish a socialist state in the Himalayan kingdom. It is estimated that more than 40% of the country is now under the control of the insurgents. On 1 February 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed the country's government and declared a state of emergency, a move condemned by the international community. Since then, political detainees have been released, and on 30 April 2005, the King lifted the state of emergency.However, basic human rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of association and a free press, remain indefinitely suspended. The judiciary has also raised questions about its independence and ability to defend constitutional rights. The security situation in the Government-controlled areas of the country is generally peaceful. However, fighting between the insurgents and security forces outside this area has intensified over the past two months, with neither side able to deal a decisive blow against the other.At the most recent session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in Geneva, held from 14 March to 22 April 2005, a resolution on the human rights situation in Nepal was adopted which provides, inter alia, for the establishment of an international monitoring mission through a regional office of the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights, OHCHR. It also calls for the restoration of democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law, an independent National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, and full and unimpeded access to places of detention for the NHRC, OHCHR and the International Committee of the Red Cross.Ireland, together with our EU partners, remains concerned at the situation in Nepal, particularly in relation to human rights. The EU has urged both King Gyanendra and the political parties in Nepal to show flexibility in engaging in dialogue and in reviving the democratic process. The EU has emphasised its strong belief that the development of multi-party democracy in Nepal must be an essential part of any acceptable and sustainable resolution of the current conflict.When he presented credentials to King Gyanendra in Kathmandu on 27 May, the Ambassador of Ireland to Nepal, who is resident in New Delhi, took the opportunity to state the EU and Irish position. In welcoming recent positive steps including the lifting of the state of emergency, the further release of political and other detainees and the appointment that day of the new NHRC, the ambassador said that the international community was also deeply interested in seeing the necessary progress in the reconciliation between the monarchy and the political parties, in the movement back to a functioning democracy and in the restoration of civil liberties. The Irish embassy in New Delhi is continuing to monitor and report on the situation in Nepal. Ireland, together with its EU partners, will continue to follow closely the situation in Nepal and to encourage both sides to pursue a peaceful, political solution and respect for human rights.

My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, discussed this issue on a number of occasions with both the President and Foreign Minister of Burundi, most recently on 21 September 2004, when he met the President in New York at the United Nations General Assembly. The Government was also presented in February 2004 with the results of the initial investigation conducted by the Burundian authorities. This report, which was presented simultaneously to the Holy See, was provided in confidence to the Government and to the Holy See. Ongoing contact has also been maintained throughout between my Department and the Holy See.Arising from the investigation by the Burundian authorities, an individual, said to have suffered serious injury during the ambush that resulted in Archbishop Courtney's murder, was arrested in February 2004. My Department has learned that the suspect has since died in custody. The Burundian authorities have assured us that they are continuing to pursue others who they believe may have been involved in the ambush but they fear that some of those concerned may have fled to a neighbouring country. The Government remains in close contact with and seeks regular updates from the Burundi authorities regarding developments in the investigation. The Burundian Government has offered assurances that they remain fully committed to taking all possible steps to bring those responsible to justice. The Government will continue to urge that all efforts are made by the Burundian authorities to apprehend those responsible for the Archbishop's murder. I also will seriously consider the issue of official representation, in the event that any trial eventually takes place.

These attacks have been of a highly intimidating nature, with paint and petrol bombs thrown at cars, houses attacked and damaged, windows broken and ordinary families terrorised in their own homes. The Government raised its concerns about these incidents through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat on 15 May and again in the wake of the attacks that occurred over the weekend of 20-21 May. Officials from my Department have met community leaders in north Belfast to discuss the situation and will continue to closely monitor the situation there as the summer progresses. The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at the end of June will afford me the opportunity to again raise the matter and I will continue to seek reassurances that appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all the residents of north Belfast. The Government consistently impresses on all community leaders, including the leadership of the political parties, the desirability of increased efforts to ease tensions and help ensure that the marching season passes off peacefully.

The programme does not assist in the purchase or rental of premises. The programme is advertised on an annual basis and applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December 2004. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. However, my Department did not receive an application for funding from the organisation in question under the 2005 programme.The organisation might like to note that section 847(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a scheme for tax relief for relevant donations to an approved sports body for the funding of sports capital projects. Approved sports status can be awarded by my Department for suitable capital projects, allowing for tax relief to be claimed by a club on donations towards the project that exceed the minimum qualifying threshold of €250 per annum. Full details of the tax relief scheme are available on my Department’s website at www.dast.gov.ie.

In respect of those company law inquiries commenced since 1997, I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 68, 88 and 108 of 31 May 2005. As the information requested is not readily available for the 1995-96 period, I will have to revert to the Deputy on the matter but will do so as soon as possible.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	403	As part of the Government's current decentralisation programme it was decided that 250 of my Department's core staff will be relocated to Carlow. The Department was identified as an early mover in the third report of the decentralisation implementation group, which gave an indicative timeframe of the second quarter of 2008 for completion of the Department's new building in Carlow. The current position is that the OPW is close to completing a site acquisition in Carlow town centre and construction is due to commence in the second quarter of 2006.While no staff of my Department have moved to Carlow as yet, I am confident that we will meet the deadline set by the decentralisation implementation group, with some 300 staff relocating to Carlow once the building has been completed. The decentralisation programme also includes the relocation of four of my Department's agencies to Birr, Arklow, Thomastown and Shannon, namely, FÁS with 383 staff, National Standards Authority of Ireland with 132 staff, the Health and Safety Authority with 110 staff and Enterprise Ireland with 292 staff, respectively. The current position is that no staff have yet been relocated by any of my agencies. Both FÁS and the Health and Safety Authority have been recommended in the third report of the decentralisation implementation group for priority attention in terms of implementing their decentralisation programmes and they are working towards progressing this recommendation. While indicative timeframes for moving Enterprise Ireland and the NSAI have not yet been set by the decentralisation implementation group, both agencies are working towards relocating to their new locations. In the autumn of 1998, prior to the current decentralisation programme, my Department re-located the Patents Office from Dublin to Kilkenny. This involved 63 staff relocating to Kilkenny city at that time.

One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement is that the tenant must be in need of accommodation and be unable to obtain it from within his or her own resources. Local housing authorities assess the accommodation needs.The Dublin-mid-Leinster area of the executive has advised that the person concerned was referred to her local authority for an assessment of her housing needs. Having completed its assessment, the local authority advised the executive that the person concerned is not considered to be in need of housing as she has the option of living in the family home. In these circumstances, she does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.

Patronage began at approximately 630,000 passenger trips per month and has grown by approximately 45% in the period to April 2005. The red line opened to the public in late September 2004. Patronage began at approximately 670,000 passenger trips per month and has grown by approximately 25% in the period to April 2005.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The total Exchequer payment for public service obligations to Iarnród Éireann in 2004 was €71.421 million, of which €1.06 million was in respect of DART interest payments. The total number of passenger journeys on Iarnród Éireann services was 34.6 million, of which 23.3 million were carried on the DART and suburban lines. The Exchequer payment for each passenger was, therefore, €4.92. It should be noted that passenger numbers fell in 2004 arising from line closures at weekends during the DART upgrade works. It should also be noted that Iarnród Éireann carries significant costs associated with the management and maintenance of the rail infrastructure.The Exchequer subvention to Bus Éireann in 2004 was €23.998 million. No Exchequer payment was made in relation to commercial Expressway services. The company carried 40 million passengers in 2004 on public service obligation services. The estimated Exchequer payment per passenger in respect of the public service obligations was 62 cent.The Exchequer provided €61.8 million to Bus Átha Cliath in 2004 for public service obligations. The company carried 149 million passengers in that year and the Exchequer payment, therefore, amounted to approximately 40 cent per passenger.The total Exchequer payment to the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, for the operation of Luas services in 2004 was €1.453 million. Luas services commenced on the green line in June 2004 and on the red line in September 2004. In 2004 Luas carried 6.6 million passengers. This equates to an Exchequer payment of 22 cent per passenger.The Exchequer subvention to the CIE group of companies for 2005 is €270.1 million, of which €179.991 million will be allocated to Iarnród Éireann services, €25.1 million to Bus Éireann and €64.9 million to Bus Átha Cliath. The companies have budgeted to carry the following number of passengers in 2005: Iarnród Éireann — 36.4 million; Bus Éireann — 40 million and Bus Átha Cliath — 150.6 million. If these projected passenger numbers are reached it would result in a subvention per passenger of €4.90 for Iarnród Éireann; 43 cent for Bus Átha Cliath and 63 cent for Bus Éireann.The RPA estimates that the subvention in respect of Luas for 2005 is €2.576 million. The RPA estimate that Luas will carry 20.58 million passengers in 2005. This equates to an operating subsidy of 13 cent per passenger. It should be noted that based on current forecasts the requirement for a subsidy of operational deficits on Luas red and green lines will cease after 2006. These forecasts are based on the assumption that patronage rises in line with projections and fares rise at least in line with the indexed cost of the contracts in place for the operation and maintenance of the Luas system and all other costs remain at forecast levels.

This figure was depressed due to the DART weekend closures. The company states that if the closures had not taken place, then the estimated total would have been 1.622 billion subdivided as follows: mainline rail — 1.242 billion and DART-suburban — 0.380 billion. Iarnród Éireann expects that there will be a growth in 2005 of between 5% and 9% gross on last year's figures.

This is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department and established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the disbursement of up to €60 million from the fund.During 2004, the board approved 420 projects for funding totalling almost €42 million. To date in 2005, the board has approved further projects bringing the overall totals to 482 approvals involving a total amount of €56.2 million. While a breakdown of these approvals by individual constituency is not available, a county analysis is set out in the following appendix for the Deputy's information.The drawdown of funding is subject to the satisfactory completion of legal contracts between the individual groups and the board. As part of this process, groups are required to submit necessary documentation, such as agreed budgets, tax clearance certificates, evidence of insurance, etc., to ADM before payments are actually made. The total amount disbursed with regard to projects approved by the board was approximately €1.4 million in 2004 and to date in 2005, this figure has increased to €4 million. Furthermore, in July 2004, following consultation with the board and in accordance with the terms of the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, as amended, €10 million from the fund was transferred to my Department to partly finance the rural social scheme.With regard to projects on the offshore islands, I understand that five applications were received by ADM. These were evaluated against the criteria set out in the published guidelines and recommendations made to the board for decision. None of these applications were successful and the groups concerned were advised of the board's decisions and offered the opportunity to seek a review of those decisions.CountyNo of Approved ProjectsValue of Approved ProjectsCarlow6313,149Cavan3606,523Clare9793,872Cork586,231,161Donegal11983,930Dublin18419,181,811Galway274,091,015Kerry254,807,470Kildare112,695,868Kilkenny6748,130Laois4199,722Leitrim7560,749Limerick161,943,616Longford7451,336Louth9700,464Mayo142,281,543Meath1112,000Monaghan1253,233Offaly160,000Roscommon121,115,269Sligo131,204,859Tipperary171,302,150Waterford152,383,602Westmeath8564,263Wexford91,319,282Wicklow81,286,788Total482€56,191,804

In addition, it is proposed that staff of two bodies, reporting to my Department, ADM and Foras na Gaeilge, will relocate — ADM to Clifden, County Galway and Foras na Gaeilge to Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal.Relocation can only take place when suitable accommodation is in place. My Department is committed to completing the relocation process to Knock Airport by 2007. This timescale is dependent on the Office of Public Works encountering no delays in the planning and building processes involved in providing the required accommodation.Temporary accommodation is currently available in Na Forbacha and relocation is subject to the availability of staff with fluency in Irish becoming available through the CAF mechanism. Prior to the announcement of the Government's plan for decentralisation in December 2003, I had decided to relocate some of the work of my Department from Dublin to Galway. Under this initiative, five posts have been relocated to date. The OPW is also in the process of securing a site in Clifden to accommodate staff of ADM.Foras na Gaeilge is a North-South implementation body and the re-location of staff of the body to Gaoth Dobhair is subject to the agreement of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC. The relevant issues that require examination prior to submission of the question to the NSMC are being pursued on an ongoing basis.

The only way to safeguard against loss from ragwort poisoning is to eradicate the weed either by pulling, ploughing, cutting or chemical control. Where weeds are pulled or cut, they must be removed and destroyed before animals are allowed to graze as they are much more palatable in the dried state. Hay or silage should not be harvested from fields containing ragwort. There are no official figures available in Ireland for deaths of horses due to ragwort poising. Unofficial estimates indicate that the level is very low and does not warrant any special attention or investigation.Over the years the problem of noxious weeds on farms has diminished with most complaints on noxious weeds now relating to urban areas, particularly derelict sites, roadways and waste areas which come within the remit of local authorities. A Teagasc advisory leaflet is available for the control of noxious weeds and is revised in line with advances in new control procedures.

On these forestry aspects I have pointed to the negative impacts that the proposals would have on the sector, particularly those relating to reduced establishment grants, premiums and associated premium payments periods. Negotiations on the Commission proposals are continuing within the Agriculture Council and as they progress, I will be pressing for the best possible outcome for Ireland on the package as a whole, including a satisfactory outcome on forestry issues.

The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and following a widespread public consultation process. A very persuasive factor in this process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states which fully decoupled would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of the overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns both in terms of total numbers of animals applied upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case.I am actively seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner and her officials. I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions during various meetings. My Department also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter on 25 April 2005. The matter has been discussed with the Commissioner's cabinet and with the most senior officials of the European Commission. Arrangements are currently at an advanced stage for a meeting between my officials and the various services of the Commission's DG Agriculture.I am availing of every opportunity to press for appropriate measures to be put in place to alleviate the difficulties encountered by beef farmers in Ireland as a result of the ending of the special beef premium in 2004. I will continue to pursue the matter with the Agriculture Commissioner and Commission officials.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 24 July 2002 and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 28 November 2002.Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options to be exercised within 15 working days of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.In the normal course of events, this person's case file, including all representations received, would fall to be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended — prohibition of refoulement. The person concerned, however, made an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of his parentage of an Irish born child born before 1 January 2005 under the revised arrangements announced on 15 January 2005.The closing date for receipt of applications for the scheme was 31 March 2005. Some 18,000 applications were received. To date, in excess of 6,000 applicants have been granted temporary permission to remain. Applications are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible and, in so far as is possible, in order of receipt. Given the number of applications being processed, it is expected that the processing of the application from the person concerned will be completed within the next few weeks.

The unit currently deals with approximately 100,000 vetting applications per annum.Although the group referred to by the Deputy cannot currently avail of this vetting regime in respect of some of its staff, these will be covered by a planned phased extension of Garda vetting arrangements to all relevant groups. In this regard, a working group was established to examine the issue of extending vetting arrangements. The working group submitted its final report in March 2004 and this report has since been published in electronic form on my Department's website. On the basis of this report, my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, announced the provision of additional staff resources for the GCVU to enable the Garda Síochána's vetting services to be extended.The Minister of State's announcement implements one of the key recommendations of the working group. The other practical recommendations are being brought forward by an implementation group chaired by the Garda Síochána and comprising representatives of my Department; the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Finance; the Office of the Attorney General and Mr. Paul Gilligan, chief executive officer of the ISPCC.I am pleased that the extension of the services of the GCVU will commence later this year, as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place, and public announcements will occur in this regard in due course.

The information requested by the Deputy is given in the tables.With regard to crime figures, on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I arranged for the publication of headline crime statistics on a quarterly basis to improve the quality of information available to the public. While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to 6 per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available.

Taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004. The tables show the headline offences, for the years 2000 to 2004 inclusive, for the Bantry Garda District.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the current personnel strength of the Bantry district, as at 31 May 2005, was 41, all ranks. The number of Garda personnel assigned to each station, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.

The district drugs unit at Kevin Street station also constantly patrols these areas.Garda management keeps the issue of resource allocation under constant review in all areas to best determine the policing methods most appropriate for local communities. In this respect the involvement of the local community directly with gardaí through local police fora is to be encouraged and supported. I am informed that, in this case, the gardaí are constantly liaising with the business community in the areas referred to with a view to ensuring that problems of concern to it are addressed effectively.

Volume drug seizures are stored in secure conditions at Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park. When no longer required as evidence, or in the event of no prosecution, they are transported to a facility where they are incinerated under the supervision of the Garda technical bureau. Smaller seizures of drugs are destroyed at district level, under the supervision of a Garda inspector.

This includes treatment and rehabilitation, supply reduction and the introduction of mandatory drug testing. I am satisfied that mandatory drug testing can play an important role in the overall strategy for tackling the scourge of drug use among prisoners. Mandatory drug testing will provide information on trends in drug misuse, enable the identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enable enhanced focusing of resources and act as a deterrent to drug misuse. Mandatory drug testing will also provide important information to prison management that will contribute significantly to decision-making in relation to the management of individual prisoners sentences.Without this basic information, planning for treatment can never be as focused as it should be and resources can never be effectively targeted. The introduction of mandatory drug testing will allow the Irish Prison Service to deploy its resources in the most rational and productive manner.

However, I have made it abundantly clear at all times that, in the absence of agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on proposals for organisational change involving new staff attendance arrangements, the intention is to proceed with a package of cost controlling measures, which includes closure of the open prisons at Loughan House, County Cavan and Shelton Abbey, County Wicklow. Thereafter those premises would not be part of the prison system and they would not be managed by the Irish Prison Service.The Probation and Welfare Service and certain voluntary organisations already provide facilities to assist prisoners with the transition from prison to life in the community. I am of the view that this area needs to be developed further and I wish to see halfway houses made available on a structured basis. Rather than leave the premises in Cavan and Wicklow idle, I have instructed my Department to make arrangements for them to be made available as halfway houses for offenders on temporary release to facilitate their re-integration into society.In a recent prior indicative notice published in the EU journal, my Department signalled an intention to invite tenders for the operation of halfway houses at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, including management, staffing, security, catering, cleaning, laundry, general maintenance and the provision of training and therapeutic programmes.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The Deputy may be aware that a review has been conducted in recent months to establish whether primary schools have the level of special needs assistant, SNA, support that they need for children in their care, whether they have resources which they no longer need or whether they need extra resources. The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the SNA was originally sanctioned, that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus SNA support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year.There is no redeployment scheme in place by which SNAs who are surplus to requirements in a particular school could be redeployed to another school. Putting such a scheme in place would be quite complex as there is no guarantee that as a post becomes surplus in one school, an additional post would become available in the locality. Unlike teachers, where posts are allocated on a pupil-teacher ratio basis which enables a redeployment scheme to work effectively, SNA posts are allocated on the basis of individual care needs and the creation of a workable redeployment scheme would be much more difficult.The Deputy will be aware that this Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Indeed, since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from under 300 to nearly 6,000 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible. It is important to state that where it has been established that additional SNA posts are required, these posts are continuing to be allocated on an ongoing basis.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I assume the Deputy is referring to the positions of special needs assistants which are allocated to schools to meet the care needs of children with special needs. My Department has undertaken a review of the number of special needs assistants in our primary schools to ensure that they have the right level of support to meet the assessed needs of their pupils.This review found that some schools had excess posts in that the care needs for which they were originally given the post no longer exist. This would be because the child that the special needs assistant was sanctioned for has either left the school or has progressed to a point that they no longer need this type of support. Special needs posts cannot be held onto by schools who no longer have the care needs for which they were sanctioned. Others schools were found to need additional SNA posts and these posts are continuing to be allocated on an ongoing basis.Following the review, my Department advised the school in question that based on the special educational needs of its pupils, it has a surplus capacity of two full-time SNA posts. The school has been advised that the surplus can be retained until the end of the current school year. The school currently has four full-time and two part-time SNA posts.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and nine mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 235 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has the services of a learning support post. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and nine mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 252 pupils at 30 September 2004.The schedule referred to above can only be deviated from when a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. Rapid growth is defined as an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 pupils plus a stipulated excess of five pupils on the appointment figure. If the board of management of the school feel that the enrolment of the school will increase by this amount, they may apply for a post under the developing schools criteria as outlined in Department circular 15/05.To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department's website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.

A sum of €21,234,960.02 has been expended from Exchequer funds up to the end of 2004 which covers administrative costs, legal costs and the Department's legal fees. The Government signed an order on 20 May 2005 extending the term of the commission up to 23 May 2008. However, the commission has indicated that it should conclude its inquiry well before that date. The overall estimated cost of the commission to the end of 2007 is €102.2 million.The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established for a three year period on the 16 December 2002. Up to the end of 2004 a sum of €141,238,936.72 was expended on redress awards and associated costs. A further sum of €30,978,640.97, received from the religious congregations under the terms of the indemnity agreement of 5 June 2002, was used to meet redress awards. The administrative cost of the redress board and the review committee up to the end of 2004 was to €12,226,640.23. Therefore, the total sum expended from Exchequer funds up to the end of 2004 was €153,465,576.95.It is not possible to determine the total number of applications under the redress scheme at this juncture. It will take the board some considerable time to deal with all applications and as a result the final cost of the scheme may not be known until some time in 2007. Based on the total number of applications the redress board expects to receive up to the 15 December 2005, and allowing for legal and administration costs, the estimated total cost of the scheme will be somewhere in the region of €680 million to €730 million.Between 1995 and the current date there have been two non-statutory inquires in the child detention school sector. Both inquiries concerned allegations made against employees of children detention schools. The first inquiry commenced in April 2002, its work finishing in July 2003. The total cost was €98,552, including VAT. The second inquiry commenced in the summer of 2002 and finished in November 2002. The total cost was €15,730, including VAT.There is power for the Minister to establish inquiries under the vocational education Acts into the fitness of officers of vocational education committees and institutes of technology to hold office. One such inquiry was established regarding a member of staff in Dundalk Institute of Technology. The cost of that inquiry was €4,381.51. Other similar inquiries have taken place but it has not been possible to obtain details of these in the time available. I will arrange to forward the information to the Deputy as soon as possible.Finally, under section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, the Minister for Education and Science has power to authorise officers to report on the operation of institutes of technology. One such inspection has been carried out in the relevant time period. The cost involved was €40,653.43.

It has been determined that the amalgamated school will be located on the site of one of the existing providers. County Offaly vocational education committee is pursing the acquisition of this site. When the site has been acquired progress on delivery of the project can be considered.

The project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-09.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a full-time special needs assistant has been approved to the school to cater for the special care needs of four pupils including the pupil in question. A letter confirming this arrangement issued to the school on the 25 February last.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	456	As the Deputy is aware the review of the general allocation system has now been completed. The new model replaces that which was notified to schools in June 2004, which has been reviewed to take account of difficulties that it may have caused for smaller schools.The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; and it will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.My Department has devised school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the general allocation system. This information has been notified to schools, where appropriate, along with the details of each school's individual allocation.In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, my Department has advised schools that where they currently have a permanent resource teacher and where they have adequate hours to warrant the continuation of a full-time post through a combination of general allocation hours and-or low incidence hours and-or transitional hours for the coming school year, they may retain the existing teacher for the school year without the status of the teacher having to change.My Department is finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. This circular will issue before the end of the current school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The transition year programme is optional for each school. A minority of schools do not offer transition year at all. In others it may be available as an optional programme for some pupils. Some schools, in deciding to offer the programme, require all pupils to take the programme in accordance with their curriculum provision across the school. In such schools — representing about 30% of the 500 schools offering the programme in the current school year — the programme is compulsory. This decision is made by school management.If a parent is unhappy with matters concerned with the management of the school he or she may make representations to the principal, the board of management and in the case of a VEC school the local vocational education committee.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and 19 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 534 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has two learning support posts, a resource post and a temporary language support post. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and 18 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 504 pupils at 30 September 2004.To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department's website. The appeals board will meet in June, July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year. The closing dates for appeals are 3 June, 24 June and 7 October. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	459	My Department allocates funding to schools to enable them to employ escorts on school transport services. These escorts are specifically engaged to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support. Over 600 escorts are employed. These escorts provide a very valuable service for children with special needs who require assistance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The system referred to is a computerised management information system known as the MIS project which is a joint project of the 15 institutes of technology. An EU-wide tender process for a standard system across the institutes was undertaken by a consortium board under the direction of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The board included representation from the institutes of technology and my Department. The MIS project involved some 59 installations in the areas of student records, finance, core payroll-human resource, and library. The total cost of the project for the 15 institutes was €45 million.At present, 58 of the installations have been completed and the remaining project, namely, the student record system in the Cork Institute of Technology, will be completed shortly. As the project was undertaken on a phased basis, I am aware that some institutes are more advanced in managing the new resource. Both the council of directors of the institutes of technology, and the Dublin Institute of Technology, have indicated strong support for the MIS project and no criticism of its performance has been notified to my Department. Indeed, I understand that some universities are now examining what has been achieved with the common MIS platform in the institutes of technology.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The National Educational Welfare Board is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The parents of the child referred to by the Deputy have been advised to contact the senior educational welfare officer for the area to seek assistance in this matter.My Department has also written to the parents informing them of their right, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, to appeal a decision by any recognised school to refuse enrolment to their child. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.It must be stressed that my Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 against a refusal to enrol and where that appeal is upheld. Information in relation to the section 29 appeals procedures, including an appeals application form and contact details for the relevant section of my Department, have been sent to the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy. To date, no such appeal has been lodged with my Department.

This information has been notified to schools, where appropriate, along with the details of each school's individual allocation. The general allocation for the school in question is 12.5 hours. In addition, the school has received one post and 15 part-time hours under transitional arrangements to cater for the needs of individual pupils with high incidence disabilities until such time as these pupils leave the school.I can confirm that this school received a teaching allocation based on its status as a mixed school, that is, the first post is allocated at 145:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. This school is not eligible for such additional staffing and therefore it does not qualify for the 80:1 ratio.My Department is finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. This circular will issue before the end of the current school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	463	As a result of earlier programmes of decentralisation, my Department has just over 300 posts located in Athlone and over 150 posts located in Tullamore. Some 400 Dublin based posts in my Department will decentralise — 300 of these will go to Mullingar and the remaining 100 will go to Athlone. I understand that it is anticipated that the building needed to accommodate the posts in Athlone should be available in late 2006 or early 2007. It is anticipated that the accommodation for the posts in Mullingar will be available sometime during 2008 at the earliest.Following the completion of the move to Mullingar my Department will be fully decentralised, with its main bases being in Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore. The only posts remaining in Dublin will be those associated with inspectorate and psychological services to Dublin schools, along with two small regional offices.My Department has set out the areas of work to be based in Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore in its implementation plan. The process of arranging to have each area of work staffed by people who wish to decentralise with that area of work when the accommodation is ready for occupation is underway.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The Government decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 3 December 2003 provides for the transfer of my Department's Dublin based Civil Service staff to Newbridge, County Kildare. The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200. The Government decision also provides for the transfer of 300 Defence Forces headquarters staff to the Curragh, County Kildare.The Office of Public Works is currently in discussions with Kildare County Council regarding the possible acquisition of a site in Newbridge for the Department's new headquarters. A site for the Defence Forces headquarters at the Curragh has been selected and preliminary planning in connection with the design of the building has commenced. Accordingly, in the absence of office accommodation, there have been no staff transfers to the new locations. It is envisaged that both relocations will take place in 2007.In the context of the White Paper on defence, the Government decision of 29 February 2000 provides for the decentralisation of the Civil Defence Board to Roscrea, County Tipperary. There are approximately 30 posts in the Civil Defence headquarters. Ten staff of the Civil Defence Board have moved to temporary accommodation in Roscrea with effect from 10 September 2004. The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Government Departments, has placed a contract for the fit-out of a leased building in Roscrea. It is expected that this building will be available for occupation later this year.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I assume that the question relates to commissions, inquiries and tribunals established for specific investigative purposes. The total cost of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments to 31 December 2004 is €37.602 million. The tribunal expects to finish all its public hearings by at the latest March 2007. It is not possible for my Department to estimate the final costs of the tribunal at this stage as these depend on the progress of its business and on decisions by the tribunal with regard to costs of witnesses.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The Commission for Public Service Appointments, set up under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, has recently published codes of practice governing recruitment to the Civil Service. The code prescribes the necessary standard of probity, merit, equity and fairness to be applied to recruitment and provides for a review-appeals procedure.Most recruitment for this Department and for senior posts in local authorities is carried out by the Public Appointments Service also set up under the above mentioned Act. The Department also directly recruits a number of staff to industrial and contract posts. The code of practice will be applied to all such recruitment in the future. In the case of competitions held prior to the publication of the code of practice, it has been the practice of my Department to examine and respond to any complaints received to ensure that due process had been followed.Recruitment by State bodies under the aegis of the Department, and posts, other than senior posts in local authorities, is generally carried out directly by those bodies. The details supplied with the question do not allow my Department to identify the particular competition or the recruiting body concerned. If the Deputy would like to supply this additional information I will have this matter examined further.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	468	In accordance with the Government decision on the first phase of moves under the decentralisation programme, the transfer of my Department's headquarters to Wexford is included in the list of those organisations considered potential early movers. The indicative timescale provided for the completion of the Department's headquarters in Wexford and the subsequent relocation of staff, is the second quarter of 2007. Consequently, no staff have been relocated at this time. A revised decentralisation implementation plan which sets out the issues to be addressed in the context of the move to Wexford, has been submitted to the decentralisation implementation group.

Accordingly, statistics relating to the number of loans advanced to fund shared ownership transactions or the number outstanding are not available in my Department. However, information on activity under the scheme for each local authority is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.Some €2,770,818 was paid to the local authorities in respect of rent subsidy under the shared ownership scheme for 2004.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-02 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Some 6,117 units were completed in 2004 under both the local authority housing construction-acquisition and voluntary housing programmes. Taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under the range of other social housing measures the needs of over 12 ,000 households were met last year. In 2005, it is anticipated that the needs of in excess of 13,000 households will be met from the same measures.The average cost of a housing unit provided in 2004 under both the local authority housing construction programme and the voluntary housing programmes is estimated at €150,000.

The total amount of development contributions collected by planning authorities in 2003 was €215 million. The 2004 planning statistics are currently being compiled; an initial estimate of the amount collected in development contributions in that year is €350 million. My Department is not yet in a position to estimate the amount of development contributions that will be collected in 2005.
