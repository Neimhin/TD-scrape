#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The statement by the Minister for Justice and Equality last evening left many people very disappointed and left many more questions to be answered. He succeeded in dragging the Garda Commissioner into this debacle, claiming that it was through a casual aside that he learned of the information about Deputy Wallace, although earlier in the week, he had said it was an official briefing or that he was advised. He failed, however, to explain how such a minor incident involving a Deputy could find its way up to the Commissioner's desk, despite the fact that it was not even recorded on the PULSE system and, furthermore, why the Commissioner felt it necessary to pass that information on to him. The crucial issue remains as to why the Minister decided to utilise that information in a political debate to undermine a political opponent. His non-apology was an insult and it missed the point. Deputy Wallace may be entitled to a personal apology but the issue is much wider than that. It is about the abuse of private information about a citizen that comes into the possession of a Minister. Is that right or wrong? The apology should have been about the misuse of that information and the abuse of his position. It was a half-hearted apology but, crucially, it missed the essential point, the essence of this issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	The Garda Commissioner is entitled to brief the Minister on serious issues but he or she is also entitled to expect that he will treat such information sensitively, properly and confidentially and that he will not seek to politicise the information given to him by the Commissioner in a political debate to undermine a political opponent. Can the Commissioner trust the Minister again with sensitive information about anybody or any issue? The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, Deputy Phelan and others have made it clear that they have concerns about how the Minister has handled this issue. The Tánaiste said there were issues to be looked at.

He apologised and said he was sorry for what happened. It is important that we get a little perspective on this. We need to look at what has happened here. A series of allegations were made about serious criminality and corruption in the Garda Síochána in the administration of the penalty points system. The allegations were taken up by a number of Deputies who repeated them in public and in the House. Individuals were named in the House before the investigation was undertaken. There were wide-ranging and sweeping allegations, which have not been stood up. It was a bad episode that allegations were made about people which were not stood up. The Minister launched an investigation, which involved considerable Garda resources, and it has shown there is no evidence of criminality or corruption. However, it found disappointing failings in the way in which the penalty points system is administered and, as the Deputy will be aware, disciplinary proceedings are being taken in a number of cases. That was the context in which the remarks were made. The Minister addressed the issue of the context in which the Garda Commissioner made the information available to him. Allegations were made, as I recall, by at least one Deputy that public officials had intervened to have road traffic offences in some way disappeared by the Garda. In his statement to the House yesterday, the Minister said "I have no doubt that the Garda Commissioner was mindful too that Deputy Wallace might make public reference to the incident as part of the public controversy which was going on about fixed charge notices and in these circumstances he had a duty to mention it to me".

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	The Minister did not say he was sorry for what he did. He said: "If Deputy Wallace believes I did him a personal wrong by mentioning it, I have no problem in saying I am sorry." That is not an apology. He did not say he was sorry for misusing private information on an individual to politically undermine him. This is wider than Deputy Wallace and the Tánaiste needs to get that point. If he was on this side of the House, he would say that exact same thing. The Minister said the exact same thing in terms of the unsuitability of a Minister in any Government using such information to score political points and to undermine a political opponent. He said it would be unacceptable behaviour for any Minister to do that in any Government. He steadfastly refused last evening to answer questions put to him regarding that quotation which came from his very mouth. He did not apologise last evening and he has not apologised. He stood over the misuse of private information supplied to him by the Garda Commissioner.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	The Taoiseach has 100% supported him in doing that and the Tánaiste is now 100% supporting him as well. He thinks it is okay to use private information that the Garda Commissioner or gardaí give to the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Tánaiste is giving him carte blanche. That is essentially what he said in his reply. I asked a simple question. Was what the Minister did right or wrong? The Tánaiste just about said it was. He used the most popular phrase emanating from Ministers right now, which is "context". The context is clear. Whether one agrees with Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly and others, what has happened since the penalty points issue was first raised has not been pretty. The Tánaiste described it as a "bad episode". One Deputy was handcuffed and ended up in a prison cell. I am uncomfortable about that, irrespective of whether people are uncomfortable about the issues raised by the Deputies. I am uncomfortable about the fact that people who might be annoying Ministers are being undermined and so on.

I think in his heart the Tánaiste knows that, but he seems to be incapable of saying so.

As happens when an issue such as this arises, a Minister comes into the House, makes a statement and takes questions. In this case, the Minister said he was sorry and the Deputy should accept this. Of course, there are issues which arise. There are issues about gardaí exercising common sense in the handling of road traffic offences. It is appropriate that they are enabled to continue to do this-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	I accept that.

The Minister has made it very clear that there is no question of him or the Garda Síochána keeping tabs on Members of this House or of him or anybody in the Government keeping tabs on political opponents. There is an issue in regard to privacy which probably requires a longer and wider discussion. Perhaps it is an issue which might be addressed by an Oireachtas committee because the issues with which the Garda Síochána is dealing should not come into the public domain, unless there is an actual charge, either through the media or in any other way.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	Fáilte ar ais, a Cheann Comhairle. Apple's CEO, Mr. Tim Cooke, has told a US Senate investigation that for the past ten years Apple Sales Ireland has paid an average corporation tax rate of just 2%. In 2011 this company paid at a tax rate of just 0.5%. Another company, Apple Operations International, also based here had an income of €30 billion between 2009 and 2012 and, amazingly, paid no tax whatsoever. How is this possible? I cannot imagine a local business getting away with this type of tax avoidance. It is one law for big corporations, developers and bankers and another for small businesses and ordinary citizens. Why was the standard 12.5% rate not applied to these companies? The Tánaiste knows that the hundreds of millions of euro in lost revenue could have been used to get people back to work, but instead ordinary people must pay more taxes to make up the shortfall. He will also know from his portfolio that this type of tax avoidance hurts the developing world. Christian Aid estimates that the lives of 350,000 children could be saved each year if this kind of corporation tax avoidance was ended. Was the CEO of Apple right when he said the average rate of tax paid by one of these companies was less than 2%? Can the Tánaiste confirm that the other Apple company has paid no tax since 2009? Will he tell us how many other companies are availing of these tax arrangements and how much revenue is being lost to the economy?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	25	That is not what I asked.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	26	Will the Deputy please do me the courtesy of listening to the answer? The corporation tax rate of 12.5% is established in law. No special tax rate deals apply to any individual company. We do not have any special low corporation tax rate regimes or arrangement for any multinational company. The tax rate which is established in law applies evenly to all companies. It is 12.5% on the trading profits in Ireland and 25% on non-trading income in this country. An issue arises because of the differences in the legal and tax systems between countries. International tax planning takes advantage of these differences in national systems and rules and Ireland has been working for some time to address these issues. We have been working at OECD and European Union levels to examine these structures and consider how international rules can be implemented to ensure fair levels of taxation. I chaired a meeting of the General Affairs Council of the European Union yesterday, at which this issue was on the agenda in preparation for today's European Council meeting. In our capacity as President of the European Union, we have been advocating addressing the issues of tax evasion, tax fraud and aggressive tax avoidance by companies operating internationally. We are advancing a series of measures to deal with them. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, together with the EU Tax Commissioner, circulated a letter setting out seven proposals on how this issue will be deal with at European Union level.  In addition, the OECD has a project on base erosion and profit-sharing which deals with these issues. Ireland is one of the strong supporters of that approach being taken by the OECD. In December last year Ireland became one of the first countries to sign an agreement with the United States to improve international tax compliance and implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. This type of agreement is being hailed as the emerging international standard for the automatic exchange of tax information. The issue of the use of the differences between the tax regimes in different states is being and can only be addressed at an international level. We support that approach. We are one of the leaders in seeking to have these tax loopholes addressed at European Union and OECD levels. In the meantime, our tax regime is established in law. There is one law for corporations. There are not different laws and different standards applying to different companies, nor are different arrangements made with different companies in respect of the tax rate. There is one law and it applies evenly to all companies.

The Minister should count this up instead of giving smart answers. The Tánaiste should look at what he has done recently to reshape Revenue. Revenue officials can now go to people's credit union and bank accounts and deduct from their salaries all sorts of taxes. The Tánaiste has said the Government is doing the things he outlined, but did officials from the Department of Finance or Revenue meet any of these companies before they made their tax returns?The Tánaiste said there is "an issue". It is more than an issue. It is a very profound matter. At a time when we are strapped and ordinary people are carrying the burden of bad policies, these corporations are able to avoid paying tax. Can the Tánaiste tell me whether officials from the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners met any of these companies before they made their returns?

I was going to appeal to the Tánaiste to intervene in the present situation on the basis of that record. However, I have to say I was shocked by his response to Deputy Martin. He chose to repeat the false assertion that the claims made on this side of the House did not stack up, even under the Garda's internal inquiry. I named one individual in this House - a member of the Judiciary who sits in judgment on ordinary drivers when they come before the court on penalty points matters. The investigation found that the judge had verbally petitioned a garda and had three penalty points written off. The report said the paper trail in that case was not adequate. Any conviction that results from a prosecution taken by the garda in question in front of the judge in question is now unsound. This is a very serious issue. It is a very good thing that the practice of terminating fixed penalty points has ceased. That is very welcome. The Tánaiste should be happy about it. We were told after the Morris tribunal that there would be a new system, that the blue wall of silence was being broken down and that those who want to report malpractice will be protected by the new confidential recipient system. The present debacle exposes that as a sham. Last night, the House was treated to a cabaret from the Minister for Justice and Equality. He tied himself up in knots. On the one hand, he emphasised the informality of the information he received, presumably to escape data protection legislation. On the other hand, he stressed the formality of the reliance on Garda Síochána legislation. The Minister has consistently created the illusion that he acted promptly, took the issue seriously and dealt with it. His claims that the information was received in his Department in September and that he got it in October have been backed up by his appointed Commissioner. That would be prompt, but there is a problem - the Taoiseach says differently. The Taoiseach has said three times in written form that the information was passed on to the Minister's Department well in advance of that. Can the Tánaiste give us some answers in that regard? Which version of events is the correct one? In what month did the Minister, apart from the dossier, first get information about the allegations of the Garda whistleblower? In light of all the unanswered questions in this context, can the Tánaiste say whether he has confidence in the Garda Commissioner, the confidential recipient, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality?

I have confidence in the Garda. I believe every Member of this House should express that confidence as well. The allegations that were made were investigated. The Minister for Justice and Equality established an investigation. The report of that investigation has been presented, published and referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. Any question of detail arising from the report can be pursued at that forum. Anyone can be invited in to participate in the discussion as a witness. The Garda Commissioner can be invited to come before the committee to answer any questions posed by Deputy Daly or any other Deputy. That is the appropriate way for it to be dealt with. That is what public accountability is about. The Deputy also asked about the protection of whistleblowers. This Government is the first to take this issue seriously. Arising from a commitment we made in the programme for Government, the drafting of the protected disclosures Bill is now at an advanced stage. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform expects to bring the Bill before the Government shortly for its approval. It will then be published and introduced before the Oireachtas. The main aim of this legislation is to encourage and support workers who raise concerns about possible serious wrongdoing in their workplace when that comes to their attention. It will achieve this by providing strong protections for workers who are penalised or victimised by employers for making a protected disclosure. The whistleblowing protections will be available to workers in all sectors of the economy, including members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. A number of specific disclosure channels or gateways will be provided for workers in the legislation to enable them to make disclosures to an employer, a responsible Minister, a regulator or, in particular specified circumstances, externally including potentially into the public domain. Important restrictions to external disclosures will be put in place in the public interest to govern external disclosures relating to law enforcement, security intelligence and defence matters. A stepped disclosure regime will be put in place under the Bill with lower thresholds to make internal disclosures, with the aim of promoting disclosure to an employer in the first instance in order to have the disclosure investigated and any failings that are revealed fully rectified. I think it is high time for legislation to be introduced to protect whistleblowers. We need to ensure that employees who discover that something wrong is happening can report that without fear of losing their jobs or being discriminated against. This issue has been outstanding for a very long time. This Government has committed to the introduction of legislation of this kind to protect whistleblowers. We are doing that. The legislation is due to be considered by the Government very shortly. I have set out its main provisions. I expect the Bill in question to be before the House very shortly.

I think five reports were produced as part of the Morris tribunal inquiries before anything was actually done. The Tánaiste has said that the report has been published and that any details of it we would like to tease out can be dealt with at committee level. That did not stop him from furnishing and repeating false assertions about the report earlier on.I notice the Tánaiste said he had confidence in the Garda Commissioner and the Garda. The reality is that many gardaí do not have confidence in the Garda Commissioner and I certainly do not. However, I do have confidence in the ordinary members of An Garda Síochána and think they deserve better and deserve to be supported. The Tánaiste was very wise not to answer my question as to whether he had confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach.

Perhaps the Tánaiste was not listening and might answer it this time. We have strong evidence to contradict the Minister's position and the Tánaiste might regret any endorsement of him and his actions. There are serious discrepancies between the contentions made by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner and evidence we have seen in this matter. There is serious evidence that whistleblowers were ignored, warned off and attempted to be silenced. The Tánaiste's endorsement of the confidential recipient might have been a little hasty also.

Serious allegations were made about the penalty points system. These allegations were investigated; there is a report and now a process by which it can be dealt with and people can be questioned in regard to it. That is the appropriate way of dealing with the matter. A set of recommendations which arose from the report are being implemented and there are some disciplinary procedures being pursued. This is an issue which was brought to light and addressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality; an investigation took place into it and there is a report and action to follow up on it. There are issues which are of legitimate public concern about how gardaí operate. As I said here before, most people's contact with gardaí or the law is in connection to road traffic offences. There are legitimate issues of public concern that the application of the law in respect of road traffic offences is applied evenly and fairly and is also applied, in some instances, with a degree of common sense. Let us take the idea, for example, that a penalty point is attached to somebody's licence and the only way it can be addressed is by the individual going to court, no matter how wrong the application of that penalty point might be. I do not think any fair-minded person believes that is the appropriate way to deal with the matter.

What people want to know and be assured of and what we should all contribute to is that the law is applied fairly to everybody, that there is not some kind of inside track or some way whereby people who are favoured or in certain positions, whether they be public positions, celebrity positions or otherwise, can have their situation dealt with more favourably than anybody else.

Somewhere in the region of 1,000 citizens across the island have lost their lives through suicide and, in my own constituency, 16 people died through suicide in 2011. One statistic really disturbs me - one child under 18 years dies by suicide every 18 days. I have raised this issue consistently with the Taoiseach. First, promises were made about 414 mental health service positions, but, to the best of my knowledge, they have still not been filed. Second, given the all-island nature of this national crisis, can some progress be made in terms of having an all-island strategy to deal with this matter? There are more people losing their lives through suicide than are now, thankfully, being lost on the roads. The approach used in that regard in terms of education and informing people would work well in suicide prevention.

As the Deputy knows, a number of measures have been progressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, while the National Office for Suicide Prevention has implemented many of the recommendations of the strategy. A special programme of measures to further advance suicide prevention is being developed and I expect that the Minister of State will be glad to share them with the Deputy and the House at the appropriate time. With regard to the Deputy's suggestion that we might deal with this issue on a North-South basis, I am very keen that we do so.As the Deputy is aware, there has been quite a degree of co-operation on a North-South basis in health. This is one area that could be developed on a North-South basis and I am sure it is something that the Minister for Health will discuss with the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Edwin Poots.

As its Long Title states, the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2013, amends the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. The proposed amendments are beyond the scope of the current Title of the Bill and so it is proposed to amend the Title of the Bill. The amendments which will be inserted as Part 3 of the Bill are to deal with serious imminent threats to life or property arising from an explosive or other lethal device. They address those circumstances where a mobile phone might be used to detonate a device remotely. The amendments provide for directions to be given to mobile phone companies to cease their services in particular geographic areas for a limited period of time where this is considered necessary to avert such a threat. As Deputies may be aware, many other jurisdictions have similar powers already in operation. For instance, our closest neighbours, Britain and Northern Ireland, have provisions in law for the issuing of directions to mobile telephone operators to cease service in certain circumstances. An Garda Síochána has a good relationship with its counterparts in Northern Ireland which is essential when dealing with the safety and security of the whole of this island. Clearly it is also important that we are able to liaise and co­ordinate with the PSNI to deal with any incidents which may involve explosive devices which can be detonated using mobile phone technology. Further afield, countries such as Australia have a range of provisions in place to deal with such situations. In my view it is important that in this jurisdiction the Garda Síochána is equipped with the necessary legislative powers to deal with incidents which may cause death or serious injury. As I previously stated in the Dáil, it is my understanding that the law enforcement authorities in Boston recently invoked such a power in response to the outrage which occurred there. Such events make it clear to all of us the importance of having measures in place to deal with extremely serious threats which may potentially result in loss of life and injury. It is a regrettable fact that terrorist organisations and criminal gangs are prepared to exploit any means, including advances in technology, to kill and maim. It is necessary, in those circumstances, for the law enforcement authorities to be given the means to counter these threats. It would be remiss of me as Minister for Justice and Equality if I ignored this reality and left the Garda Síochána bereft of the necessary tools to meet that threat. I trust that all Deputies will be in agreement with me on this obvious fact. I wish to assure the House, however, that the proposed legislation adopts a balanced and proportionate response to the threat. Accordingly, the powers contained within it are subject to a range of safeguards and conditions. The powers proposed in the amendments are only available where there is a serious threat that an explosive or lethal device is likely to cause loss of life, serious injury or serious damage to property. The powers cannot be used other than in such a situation and the procedures and checks are set out clearly in the proposed legislation, thereby ensuring that both an effective and safe system will be in place. The system provides for a two-tier process involving decisions at ministerial level and at Garda level. An application must first be made to the Minister by a very senior Garda of Assistant Commissioner rank or higher, for authorisation to issue directions. The Minister may only give an authorisation if satisfied as follows: that there are reasonable grounds for believing a serious threat exists; there is a reasonable prospect that cessation of mobile phone services within a geographical area would be of material assistance in averting the threat; having regard to all the circumstances, including the importance of maintaining mobile phone services in the area concerned and the effect on users, that cessation of services is necessary and proportionate. There is a 24 hour limit on the time for which an authorisation may be acted upon. A central element of the part is in the proposed section 24 which provides for a member of the Garda Síochána of chief superintendent rank or higher, having received a ministerial authorisation, to direct a mobile phone service provider to cease providing services in a particular area at a particular time. This power to issue a direction is subject to a range of checks and balances which are contained in Part 3. For instance, a Garda chief superintendent may only give a direction where he or she is satisfied that the serious threat continues to exist and where other means of averting the threat are less likely to succeed. A direction is limited in effect to six hours. Where a direction is no longer required it must be withdrawn. Mobile phone companies will be required to comply with a direction and failure to do so will be an offence. Mobile phone companies must endeavour to continue to provide 999 call services. In our society today, it is inescapable that mobile communications are central to everyday life and business whether they are used as a social tool or communicator such as is the case with Facebook, or for more serious communications in relation to work or similar activities. I say this because it is important that the House recognises that the powers proposed in these provisions are not being introduced lightly. They are being introduced as there is now a need for such powers in our society if we are to be able to deal effectively with those who may be involved in posing a threat to life by the use of explosive devices that can be detonated by mobile phones and who have the ability and technical knowledge to achieve this. We must ensure that we have the capability to deal with such developments. This is about protecting and saving lives. I reiterate that the powers are subject to the conditions I have mentioned which are consideration and application by an Assistant Commissioner, consideration and authorisation by the Minister, consideration and direction by a chief superintendent, 24-hour limitations on authorisations, six-hour limitations on directions and tests of necessity and proportionality. Above all, the powers are only available where there is a serious and imminent threat to life, limb or property from an explosive or lethal device activated by mobile communications services. It is a regrettable reality that terrorists and others use explosives to threaten, maim and kill. We must provide for that reality. The Garda Síochána and PSNI advise that cell-activated devices are a real threat on the island, North and South. I am very conscious that interference with mobile telephone services is an interference with the everyday lives of people and of businesses. The powers outlined in the amendments are necessary and proportionate. They are necessary because terrorists and criminals try to exploit mobile telephone services to remotely detonate bombs. They are proportionate because they are subject to a range of safeguards and conditions. I will, of course, expand on the content of the amendments as we discuss them in the debate. I hope these matters will have the general support of Members and I commend this motion of instruction to the House.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	164	I note at the outset that Fianna Fáíl is, obviously, supporting the motion. The Minister has spoken to the motion in the context of the forthcoming G8 summit, which is one of the most important global political events and brings together the leaders of the world's foremost economies. It will attract immense public and media focus as well as protests from anti-globalisation groups and other organisations. The summit will also offer the Border region a platform to exhibit itself across the globe, attract greater levels of tourism and showcase the advancements made over the 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. Inevitably, the concentration of political power in one spot makes it a real target for potential terrorist strikes. Extraordinary security measures must be put in place to secure the area and protect the reputation of the region when it is at the centre of global political attention. Having all eight global leaders on the island represents a great opportunity for the country, which, I hope, we can use to our advantage by welcoming these leaders. The proposal on Report Stage to empower the Minister to close mobile telephone networks is an extraordinary measure of the type that can only be used in the most extreme circumstances. It is not a power that can be used lightly by any Government. I am wary of the fact that the amendment has been put forward at such a late point in the progress of the Bill when it should have been debated and thrashed out at an earlier moment. Regardless of that issue, Fianna Fáil is supportive of it. While powers like this should not be haphazardly or belatedly handed to Government without proper scrutiny, the amendment merits support in the exceptional circumstances in which it has been moved. These powers must be used with real discretion to ensure that ordinary citizens do not find themselves cut off from the world due to a closed mobile telephone network or by any improper misuse of the powers being vested in the Minister. We must look at the world to see how other jurisdictions have reacted to and planned for these events. We saw recently the situation in Boston and the awful events surrounding the marathon there. The authorities in Boston had the facility to close down the mobile telephone network to counter the detonation of any further devices that might have been planted in the Boston area. It is an example of the way to do things. The Minister has also spoken of our neighbouring jurisdictions, in which similar legislation exists. Given the proximity of Fermanagh, where the G8 summit will take place, it is obvious that we must go ahead and include the proposed section in the legislation. On the matter of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill, there has been widespread reporting in the last number of days on the volume of money being transferred out of the State through the money transfer agencies. It throws up a lot of questions. The reports came on foot of a World Bank report which was the subject of articles in The Irish Times and other publications. The World Bank reported that in 2011, Irish people sent home $750 million while foreign people living here remitted outward $2.4 billion. The latter figure was an increase on the 2003 figure of $788 million. According to a breakdown of the figures, the United Kingdom was the destination for the largest single volume of money remitted in 2011 at $680 million. The next largest volume of funds was transferred to Nigeria, to which $601 million was remitted. Third was Poland, to which $224 million was remitted. We have estimates for 2012 but the 2011 figures are published and reported by the World Bank. It throws up a number of questions given the number of people living in the State who come from those particular destinations. While the recent census showed that there are seven times as many Polish people living in the State as Nigerian people, 2.7 times as much money was remitted to Nigeria as to Poland. A number of money transmitting agencies operate in the State, including Western Union and MoneyGram, and we must focus on their regulation. The Central Bank has a monitoring mechanism to look at trends in transfers of over €100 and one of the requirements is to know the client. We may need to lift the lid on this a bit more to look at the volume of transactions. On the face of it, a number of questions are raised given the number of Polish as opposed to Nigerian people living here and the disparity in the volume of money leaving the country to go to Poland versus Nigeria. I cite those destinations as they were the ones which were flagged in the World Bank report. I have submitted a number of parliamentary questions to the Taoiseach, Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Finance on the subject and take the opportunity to raise it here also. It is something we must look at given that €2.4 billion is being remitted out, a quarter of which is going to one destination at a high per capita rate. It throws up a lot of questions. To gain a greater understanding, we may have to look at the volume of transactions and the quantum of money being remitted in each individual transaction. It is a relevant matter to the legislation on money laundering and terrorist financing which is under discussion and I take the opportunity to flag it today.Fianna Fáil has no issue supporting the motion.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	165	I will not require 15 minutes. The Minister indicated on Second Stage and on Committee Stage that he intended to bring forward significant amendments and that he may have to change the name of the Bill to facilitate the amendments. I recall the debate on Second Stage took place soon after the bomb attacks in Boston that availed of mobile telephone communication. There is genuine concern and these matters evolve as time moves on. If the Minister is saying the security and intelligence services in the State, working in co-operation with the PSNI in the North, has solid intelligence of a real threat, then citizens will accept that, under strong conditions, it is necessary to shut down a mobile telephone network to prevent the threat. We will monitor this closely because we have concerns about how intelligence services conduct their business. If there is a real threat to people's lives and this is a means to prevent it, that is fine. The intent is fine but our difficulty is that it is a haphazard way to deal with legislation. The debate on Second Stage took place weeks ago, following the attacks in Boston. I understand it is linked to the G8 event in Fermanagh and the need for an all-Ireland synchronisation of the intelligence and security response. The legislation we are dealing with deals with money laundering and criminality and the support measures to tackle criminal gangs, which I will deal with at length. The Minister has an acceptable intent to put in place measures to protect people's lives in the State from a real threat that has been proven in recent times. Why can the Government not do this in terms of other issues that impact on our international responsibilities, such as the revelation yesterday in the US Senate committee about Apple? Apple may not be the biggest avoiders but the issue is that it says it pays less than 2% tax-----

We also have responsibilities to the international community in terms of business and attracting business. That is the link point I am making. Where is the radical intervention through an existing Bill to make something happen and to change our laws to comply with our international responsibilities? We have been criticised by the US Senate and the public accounts committee in Westminster. Why can we not do it in respect of these matters? The other point linked to the specifics of the Bill we should be discussing today is the report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about white collar crime and tax avoidance. The Government has been aware of this for quite a while. Citizens in Ireland are avoiding their tax responsibilities with offshore accounts. This is a global approach where people in the professions, such as accountancy and law, assist this. It is estimated that between €16 trillion and €25 trillion is hidden in offshore accounts. Many Irish citizens are involved in the business. Where is the dramatic intervention in the process of legislation changing a Bill to make it happen and deal with the issue? I refer to the Ansbacher debacle. No one was prosecuted. We are discussing money laundering, criminality, criminal gangs and their impact on our economy, and white collar crime and its impact. Tax avoidance is stealing from our State. The Government is choosing to ask people to pay the family home tax to raise €500 million per annum. How many hundreds of millions of euro have been lost through legalised tax avoidance by major corporations and white collar crime? I do not see the Government coming in with emergency interventions in legislation to make it happen yet the Government is doing it here. That is our point. There seems to be a selective approach to haphazard legislation when it suits but in other cases it cannot happen because it will be delayed in the Office of the Attorney General and the process will go on until we have a solution. With regard to the specifics of the Bill we were dealing with, the Exchequer is losing €861 million annually because of illegal black market activity and theft. Sinn Féin supports the original Bill, which brings Ireland into line with international norms on tackling these issues. Retail Excellence Ireland made an excellent presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on cigarette smuggling and the practical solutions proposed, such as scanning containers. Retail Excellence Ireland offered to resource some of the cost of handheld devices that can be used in markets to see if illegal cigarettes are being sold. The impact is profound because we know the cost of smoking to health services. We know the lost revenue from cigarette smuggling and the Government should do everything it can to co-operate to tackle criminal gangs in terms of diesel laundering and cigarette smuggling. We must protect citizens but the issue I have is that when it comes to major corporations and white collar criminals in the State, there is not the same urgency to amend legislation. That is our fundamental objection to the motion. This seems to be a selective approach. Who could not agree with the need to shut down a mobile telephone network for a period of time to protect citizens?

#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	219	The reason I have made these points is that this is significant. The amendments being introduced by the Minister required a motion so Members could speak on them. It is a very significant set of amendments that changes the name of the Bill and requires a motion. It does not happen every day. If it is possible for the Minister to take this approach, I would like him and the Government do the same with other matters that are important. That is my core point, and I do not wish to get into a dispute with you, a Cheann Comhairle, on that. In conclusion, the issue the Minister has brought forward is one that I accept must be addressed by the Government. That is fair enough. My only objection is the process the Minister has chosen. If he is saying this is a necessary intervention he must make, and he did raise it on Second and Committee Stages, I ask him to also consider that approach and to accept representations from the Opposition for other matters of importance that require us to meet our international obligations. We have a difficulty with the approach the Minister has taken on this but if he says it is necessary, we would like the same approach to be taken on other issues too.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	220	These amendments are really quite extraordinary. Clearly, the Minister is giving himself draconian powers in advance of the G8 summit. The British Government, the authorities in the North and now, sadly, this Government are party to whipping up a climate of hysteria and fear before the G8 summit, and these amendments are part of creating that climate of fear. It is a cynical strategy of tension in advance of that summit and is designed to discourage legitimate protests and demonstrations against the policies of the G8. That is the reason these amendments are being made at such short notice. That is the context for this Bill and it is why it is entirely legitimate for us to point out that what the Minister should be doing, instead of cynically whipping up a climate of fear to give himself power to discourage and scare people from engaging in legitimate protests against the G8, is facilitating a discussion about the policies of the G8 and how they represent a far more serious threat to human life, the environment and the welfare of citizens throughout the world than any so-called terrorist threat the Minister tries to conjure up to justify this legislation. I will support that assertion. Incredibly, this set of amendments is being tabled at the same time as 3,500 police are being drafted into the North from Britain to create a ring of steel around the G8. Drone airplanes which have been used to wreak death and destruction on thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan are being deployed in the North of Ireland around the G8 summit. The Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, has announced that a former army base is to be opened to detain protesters and that there will be special sittings of the courts in the North on Sundays. That is absolutely unheard of. To put it in context, the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, which is supporting this, does not even allow children's playgrounds to open on Sundays. Now, it wants courts to open on Sundays in advance of the G8 summit. Against that background, the Minister has brought forward these amendments at the last minute and without proper debate to deal with potential terrorist threats and is using that to justify him having the power to interfere with mobile telephone communications in advance of the summit. He knows that demonstrations will be organised by anti-poverty, environmental and anti-globalisation groups, trade unions and many other groups in civil society against the militarist policies of the G8 and against the policies the G8 use to protect and promote the interests of multinationals and financial speculators at the expense of hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens around the world. Rather than discussing a bogus terrorist threat, the Minister should be discussing the fact that there are 900 million people starving in the world as a result of the policies of the G8. Let us put this in context. At the last G8 summit, a commitment was made to give €20 billion to deal with world poverty. It is a pathetic figure when one compares it, for example, with the €400 billion that are given in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry which is destroying our climate. However, the G8 did not even deliver on the €20 billion commitment. It is a tiny fraction of what the G8 countries spend on weapons and war. The United States, for example, accounts for 41% of all military spending. They are responsible for taking the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq and tens of thousands in Afghanistan. They have a massive nuclear arsenal, paid for with trillions of dollars. The Minister talks about the terrorist threat. They are the terrorist threat, and the Minister is putting a ring of steel around them instead of having a serious discussion about who represents the real threat. This is clearly designed to discourage protests, demonstrations and serious debate about the policies of the G8. It is absolutely right in this context to raise the issue of how these superpowers have been facilitating the financial and corporate interests that caused the economic crisis that now besets the globe. We have found more evidence yet again of how these interests are not even paying taxes in this country or any other country to contribute to the societies from which they generate their billions and sometimes trillions in profits, which should be going back into society but are being hoarded by a global, super-wealthy elite. Why is the Minister not discussing the damage that is doing to our economy and society, the damage their militarism is doing to millions of people around the world and how their policies contribute to global poverty and environmental destruction? It is cynical on his part and on the part of the authorities in the North. It is somewhat disappointing that parties in the Northern Assembly, including those which are represented in the Dáil, are not speaking up very loudly against this and demanding that this climate of fear the Minister is trying to whip up be abandoned. The Minister should allow protests and not try to discourage, intimidate or interfere with them.For example, will the Minister use these powers to try to prevent protesters from communicating with one another in advance of the G8 summit in County Fermanagh? We have absolutely no safeguards to suggest he will not abuse these powers in that way. In 2002 I was in Genoa at the G8 summit when a young Italian was murdered by the Italian Carabinieri which ran amok against peaceful protesters protesting against the policies of the attendees at the summit. I hope the Minister will assure us that the authorities of the State and in the North will not abuse their powers and do the same to peaceful protestors in County Fermanagh.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	We are actually debating a technical motion to allow amendments, to which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has been referring. These amendments will be discussed on Report Stage if the motion is passed. Since they were not addressed on Committee Stage, there is a technicality involved in order to allow the amendments to be discussed on Report Stage. That is why I am at pains to point out that what we are dealing with is a technicality. I make this point just in case Members do not understand.

While I may not be in favour of everything the G8 summit stands for, I am delighted it is to be held in this country. I am delighted it is to be held in County Fermanagh. I am delighted with the exposure County Fermanagh is getting. It is a fabulous county and I have travelled every inch of it during the years. Its lake district is beautiful from a tourist's perspective. It is a county of small farmers. However, havoc has been wreaked on it, including by the Enniskillen bomb and other incidents. I am not making little of what my colleague said or is worried about. We are all worried about overzealous action by all police forces, certainly in times of heightened tension when so-called important people are attending an event. The summit will result in great exposure and it is only right that most modern countries have the powers covered in the legislation. We have seen that the tracing of mobile telephone calls was responsible for the solving of a very serious murder case recently. We all expect that the powers will be used only as a last resort and for a limited time. The Minister states there is a 24 hour limit on the time for which an authorisation may be acted upon and that it must be withdrawn after six hours. Will he clarify whether an authorisation may be acted upon at any time within a 24 hour period and that it can last only for six hours? The Minister has stated a Garda chief superintendent may give a direction only where he or she is satisfied that the serious threat continues and where other means of averting the threat are less likely to succeed. We live in very sophisticated times and must obviously take every threat seriously. Those of us with children can see that they can do anything with mobile phones. They can do a lot more than I can do. I can text, read messages and send e-mails; that is all. The circumstances are very serious.  The Minister may give authorisation only if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing there is a serious threat; if there is a reasonable prospect that cessation of mobile phone services within a geographical area would be of material assistance in averting the threat; and having regard to all the circumstances, including the importance of maintaining mobile phone services in the area concerned and the effect on users, that cessation of services is necessary and proportionate. I hope that will be the case. With all the talk about An Garda Síochána in recent times, it is time for us to focus on the job it does. On 99.9% of occasions, the job of gardaí is very difficult. They provide a good service for the State and do their best. They use discretion every hour of every day. I am sure discretion is one of the first aspects of their duties. If they did not exercise discretion, the courts would be full and clogged up. There ought to be discretion and gardaí use it wisely.  The Minister stated:A central element of the part is in the proposed section 24 which provides for a member of the Garda Síochána of chief superintendent rank or higher [this is very senior], having received a ministerial authorisation, to direct a mobile phone service provider to cease providing services in a particular area at a particular time. This power to issue a direction is subject to a range of checks and balances...We have dealt with some of the checks and balances. It must be embarrassing for the Minister today. He was here last night to answer questions on this matter. He ought to enjoy the total belief and trust of the community. Organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and Community Alert, of which I have been a member since 1985 or 1986, are encouraging people all the time to support An Garda Síochána. The force cannot police without the support of the public; that is a recognised fact among police forces all over the world. What has happened this morning and the Minister's replies and non-replies about little chitchats with the Commissioner are undermining this. With regard to the G8 summit and everything else, we need the support of the public. Policemen cannot be in every field in County Fermanagh and every shed and haystack. The eyes and ears of the public are vital, including south of the Border. The trust has been shattered - pardon the pun. It is a very serious issue and I am not sure the Minister realises it, although he ought to. He was not invited to the GRA conference and other events. There are many complicating factors. He should come off his high horse and engage with gardaí and support them at rank and file level. I ask that some attention be paid to the ongoing problem of smuggling, which is considerable. This morning we learned of a successful raid on a location by Customs officers and armed gardaí. Powers such as those included in the legislation and resources must be given to the Garda to tackle the problem. RGData and other groups made presentations to Oireachtas Members. Ordinary businesses have been wiped out by the illegal trade in fuel and cigarettes. My good wife is from Monaghan. South of the Border, adjoining counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, the farming community is being cleaned out. Cattle, sheep and equipment are being stolen. There are marauding gangs that seem to operate with impunity. Why can we not introduce certain powers to put them away? I received a letter from the Minister last week. He might consider the serious report he received from the Omagh bomb victims and deal with it appropriately. He might consider what he promised in opposition and what Deputy Flanagan has asked him to do, namely, reopen the Fr. Niall Molloy murder case. He should live up to the promises he made in opposition and, above all, do his duty as Minister for Justice and Equality to give confidence to the public, support the Garda and give it the tools of the trade. This is serious legislation which I support, but the Minister might ask the Commissioner in his next chitchat or briefing to sign off on the text alert initiative being supported by Muintir na Tíre which was launched in my county last week. Tremendous work has been done to prevent crime and support the Garda. The system is to be run through the Garda, not by a private militia or anything else. For some reason, however, the Commissioner is reluctant to sign off on the initiative. The assistant commissioner has agreed to it and community groups are ready to proceed. Signs are up and research and work have been done, yet the go-ahead cannot be obtained from the Minister and the Commissioner. The Minister might overrule the Commissioner, if necessary, because the initiative is community supported. It has been cleared by An Garda Síochána at all levels, except at the top, where there is a blockage. The Minister has plenty of work to do with regard to the faith we all have in An Garda Síochána. He should support the force or else do the honourable thing, move to some other Ministry or return to his law practice.

I thank Deputies for supporting this important measure which, as I stated, is about saving lives. It is not simply relevant to the G8 summit. It is also relevant because we still have terrorists on this island who are prepared to maim and kill.Unfortunately, this island is not immune from international terrorism. We saw the dreadful event that took place in Boston. There is now an easy capacity to detonate bombs by use of mobile phone technology. We cannot ignore that. We must provide the gardaí with the support and backup they require in this area. This is a power only to be used in exceptional circumstances in a balanced and proportionate way, but it is a power that is necessary. It is important also, I say to Deputy Boyd Barrett, in regard to the G8. Deputy Boyd Barrett is addicted to conspiracy theories. We live in a democracy.

We also, though, have a duty to ensure on the whole island of Ireland that if some terrorist group or individuals with extreme political ideology decide they want to launch an attack on world leaders attending the G8 meeting that we have the capacity to deal with issues that could arise. I know Deputy Mac Lochlainn recognises and welcomes the fact that there will be similar capacity available to An Garda Síochána in the Republic as is available to the PSNI in the North. We must protect the lives of everyone on this island as best we can, be they world leaders or ordinary citizens going about their day-to-day lives. In that context this is an important provision and I very much appreciate Deputies being supportive of it. I heard what Deputy Mac Lochlainn said about other issues. I can only deal with issues that fall within my remit as Minister for Justice and Equality. There are other areas of policy which are dealt with by colleagues in government. Where there is a necessity to introduce emergency legislation they do so. I urge Deputy Mac Lochlainn not necessarily to buy in to narratives that are now taking place in regard to the areas of tax and multinational companies. The initiative the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is taking in Europe in dealing with these matters is of importance, and indeed a global initiative is necessary. In these areas it is not an issue, as some people like simplistically to paint it and as some outside this island are painting it in other countries, for our tax laws. It is about the global tax environment and the particular regimes which exist in other states that facilitate multinational businesses entering into complex financial and legal arrangements that facilitate their reducing the overall level of tax they may have to pay in the context of profits they earn.  This is not something we as a State can address singly. In fact, no individual state on its own can address this issue in the multinational area. There is no emergency legislation that could be introduced to resolve this issue. There is a need for a global approach. The initiatives taken by the Tánaiste, Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, at European Union level in providing leadership in addressing these issues during the Irish Presidency is of particular importance, and they deserve praise for the work they have been doing in regard to these issues. I am conscious that we have strayed far and wide and I do not want to get into trouble with the Chair. On the issue raised by Deputy Collins, there are different figures currently floating through the media. In fact, the origin of some of these figures is not clear with regard to funds transferred out of the country. It is not, of course, unusual. Deputy Collins gave his own illustration in the context of people who emigrated from Ireland transferring funds back to this country. Deputy Collins detailed some of the figures that apply. There are, of course, people living in this State who are earning funds and transferring them out of Ireland. These are issues that are a matter for the Central Bank. The Department of Finance has discussed this issue with the Central Bank which is looking into the matter. All of the figures that have been published in the media, I would say to Deputy Collins, may not be accurate. These are issues, of course, that I looked at. It is very important to say that the general money laundering rules regarding identification of customers and the reporting of suspicious transactions apply to money transactions in other financial institutions. This Bill further tightens these rules. Section 2 reduces the threshold at which the identification of a beneficial owner must be identified in the case of occasional transactions by wire transfers from €15,000 to €1,000. The actual legislation we are amending provides the overall money laundering criminal mechanisms to address this issue. In addition, Council regulation 178 of 2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfer of funds requires money transmitters to obtain basic information on the sender of any transmission of €1,000 or over. The financial institutions and those engaging in the transfer of financial funds must maintain certain records and continue with oversight. The Central Bank has a role in these areas and the overall legislation in this area is important.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, to delete line 8 and substitute the following:"2010, to provide for the cessation of mobile communications services where necessary for the aversion of serious threats, and to provide for related matters.".This amendment provides for a change to the Long Title of the Bill which arises from the amendments being introduced to the Bill as Part 3. As discussed during the debate on the motion, the purpose of these provisions is to allow for mobile phone services to be shut down in response to a serious threat. Amendment No. 8 provides for a definition section, section 14, for the purposes of Part 3. Key terms are defined and draw, where appropriate, on existing statutory provisions. For example, the definition of "mobile communications service" refers to a publicly available electronic communications service which is defined in the Communications Regulation Act 2002. A key definition is that of "serious threat" which forms the basis for any consideration of the exercise of the powers contained in this part. The powers conferred under it will be available only where a serious threat is imminent. Amendments Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, sections 15 to 18, inclusive, deal with the provisions relating to authorisations. Amendment No. 9 which provides for section 15 contains the conditions justifying an authorisation by the Minister. The Minister may only give an authorisation if satisfied that there are serious grounds for believing there is a serious threat that cessation of mobile phone services within a geographical area would assist in averting the threat and having regard to all the circumstances, including the importance of maintaining mobile phone services in the area concerned and the effect on users, the cessation of services is necessary and proportionate. Amendment No. 10 which provides for section 16 governs the making of an application to the Minister for an authorisation. It must be made in writing by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of assistant commissioner and include sufficient information to enable the Minister to determine whether the conditions for issuing an authorisation are met. The application should be made in writing. However, in cases of exceptional urgency it can be made orally and confirmed later in writing. The Minister shall make inquiries necessary to his or her consideration of the application. Subsection (7) provides for the Minister, for reasons of public safety or security or essential interests of the State, to refuse to disclose various matters relating to an authorisation. Amendment No. 11 which provides for section 17 sets out the manner in which an authorisation is given and the conditions governing an authorisation. An authorisation must be given in writing. In exceptionally urgent cases it may be given orally, but it must be confirmed in writing. An authorisation may remain in force for 24 hours only. An authorisation will permit a garda of chief superintendent rank or higher to issue directions to undertakings as licensed mobile phone companies.

Theoretically, if the entire country were under threat, then it would be possible. The reality, as happened in Boston recently, is that an area may be identified as having a threat and coverage would be shut down there. It would be highly unlikely that such an event would apply to the entire country but there are circumstances in which it could. For example, it could apply to the entire country if there were serious and substantive intelligence available to an Garda Síochána which indicated a major incident would occur within a particular timeline but there was not absolute clarity as to the location at which it would occur. Under the circumstances in which these powers have been used in other jurisdictions, it has been normally confined within a discrete area. The technology available to mobile telephone companies allows them to do that.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	These amendments are an abuse of process as they have nothing to do with the original Bill which deals with money laundering and financing terrorism in what the Minister described as a technical Bill. It is debatable as to whether it is a technical Bill but it certainly has nothing to do with these amendments. Amendments which fundamentally change the Bill’s character and involve giving the Minister for Justice and Equality, as well as his successors, pretty draconian powers by any definition should not be brought in at the last minute or tacked on to a Bill that has nothing to do with the issues they concern. The only explanation for this odd state of affairs where the Minister introduces these extraordinary amendments to a Bill which has nothing to do with the issues in them can be the timing in advance of the forthcoming G8 summit in Fermanagh. There is simply no other reason it would have to be rushed in this way, other than the fact that Minister is meeting a schedule to prepare for the G8 summit. He should at least admit that and tell us why he is in such a rush to bring this legislation which, at the very least whatever he may think, requires serious scrutiny. There is an irony in the Minister accusing others of engaging in conspiracy theories when the whole basis of these amendments is a conspiracy theory that there is a real and imminent threat to cause explosions when there is no basis for such an assertion whatsoever. These supposed threats must be justified by the Minister. He must give us credible evidence that such a threat exists, that these powers are necessary and proportionate, and that they are likely to be effective in dealing with such a threat, if it exists. The Minister, of course, does not want that serious scrutiny of these amendments because that is not the purpose of this Bill. This set of amendments is timed to coincide with the preparations for the G8 summit. It is cynical to engage in this. Will the Minister give us an assurance that these powers will not be abused during the G8 summit or other protests? I do not accept the rationale behind these amendments. I have not heard sufficient argument from the Minister’s side to justify the amendments. Even if I accepted the rationale, should he not make a distinction between a bomb threat, a weapons threat and peaceful protests? The definitions as they stand are vague. They refer to possible threats to human life. How will these be construed? If the Minister said there was credible evidence that people were running around with guns in a particular vicinity threatening lives, then he might have a more credible argument for saying we need these powers. However, the amendments as they stand are much more vague and general than that. As I see it, there is nothing whatsoever in the way these amendments are worded to stop the Minister and the Garda making the decision to turn off mobile phone communications in and around a protest. It is not a conspiracy to suggest that such actions may be considered. I refer again to my experience in Genoa during protests at the 2001 G8 summit. It was not a funny experience as much as the Minister might smile wryly about it. A young man was killed there by Italian police. It produced a huge reaction from the Italian people about what went on. What happened there was absolutely disgraceful. It might be of interest for the Minister to know that the Italian justice Minister directing these actions at the time was Gianfranco Fini, a fascist supporter, an ideology the Minister opposes. What is to stop a Minister in the future abusing these powers? That needs to be discussed and that is why these amendments should not be tacked on in this way. I do not trust the timing or the rationale behind the provisions. There are also serious questions as to how these powers could be abused in the future. They should be debated separately from what the Minister describes as a technical Bill.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	There you go again. The Bill is very clear. It is about the protection of life. It is not, as the Deputy is suggesting, about preventing peaceful demonstrations. Not all the demonstrations we have seen occur at G8 meetings have been peaceful. I have absolutely no doubt that in the context of those demonstrations many people participated in good faith with peaceful intent. They had genuine issues about which they were concerned. Unfortunately, as we know, some of these demonstrations have been infiltrated by others who do not have peaceful intent and have behaved extremely violently in locations with which the Deputy would be familiar. I do not know if he follows every G8 summit and demonstrates personally at each one but he will have witnessed what I have described. If there are difficulties at a demonstration, it is always important that any conduct of police is proportionate and appropriate to the events taking place.The Deputy and I do not disagree on that issue and occupy the same space. We may disagree politically in our perceptions of the world, but it is always important, first, that people are allowed to peacefully demonstrate; second, that, in the context of policing and security issues, the police behaves in a reasonable and proportionate manner; and, third, that the State does what is necessary to protect lives of citizens and others who visit the State. I wish the world was as simple as the Deputy believes it to be. I wish there were no terrorist threats or individuals who are convinced by a variety of ideologies, whether it be fascism or Islamic extremism, or individuals who have a view of the world that results in their engaging in violence. I wish that did not happen, but the sad reality is that this still happens on this island. Let us not pretend it is still not a problem. It is not the problem that it used to be, but it remains a problem. It is appropriate, therefore, that we are dealing with this issue today. On 22 May 1998 the overwhelming majority of people on this island voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. They voted for an end to terrorism and in favour of peace and dialogue. It is right that we note that today is the 15th anniversary of the vote on the Agreement. The sad reality is that there is still on this island a group of criminal terrorists intent on murder and mayhem who have no mandate and no interest in the democratic view of the overwhelming majority of the people. In the context of his own approach to political issues, the Deputy should not forget this. A constable and a prison officer have been shot dead in recent times in Northern Ireland. Attempts have been made to blow up individuals, including members of the PSNI. Following the good work done by the police forces on the island, a number of potential atrocities have been prevented. The Deputy seems to think it is a bad thing that people coming to the island to attend the G8 conference should be safe and secure. The Taoiseach will attend the meeting representing the European Union. We should be proud of the fact that he will attend the meeting and represent the voice Europe can express at such meetings which are of substantial importance. I presume that, whatever his political differences with the G8 leaders, the Deputy will agree that those attending the meeting, in the context of the democratic values he supports, are entitled to participate and engage in their discussions without a threat to their lives and that it is important that those who accompany them, some of whom may be on this side of the Border, with others on the far side of it, are afforded the maximum protection necessary of the State against individuals who may engage in terrorism. That issue is relevant to this measure and I do not pretend otherwise, but the measure is not being enacted solely because of the G8 conference. We need it in our law to bring our protective measures up to date having regard to the way technology has developed and the possibility of individuals remotely detonating explosive devices. It is as simple as that. It has nothing to do with stopping people from demonstrating peacefully and it is extraordinary that the Deputy should think so. It is also extraordinary that a small number of Members stood up to oppose us dealing with this matter today. This is not an abuse of the House because it has been, on occasion, the practice in the House that where there is a need to deal with an issue of importance and where the legislation has been prepared, for it to be recommitted. I did this many years ago in the context of an important measure which had nothing to do with this area - the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill 1987. There was a need to recommit it in order that provisions the then Fianna Fáil Government had removed on Committee Stage could be restored to protect women and children. There is nothing extraordinary about recommitting a Bill. One of the amendments we are discussing will ensure the legislation is entitled, the Criminal Justice Bill 2013. It will be suitably titled and not confined to money laundering issues. In circumstances where an overwhelming majority of the House recognise that it is necessary to deal with this issue, there is not an abuse of process. I am not surprised at some of the Deputies who stood up to oppose us dealing with it, but I am surprised Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly joined the group. Perhaps he was wrong footed and did not know what the vote was about. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said this power might be used to disrupt a peaceful demonstration. If he had read the Bill, he would know that is not so. I refer to section 50 which provides for the conditions for the authorisation being granted. They are reasonable grounds for believing there is a serious threat; a reasonable prospect that the cessation of a mobile communications service within a geographical area - the issue raised by Deputies Mattie McGrath and Niall Collins - would be of material assistance in averting that threat; and, having regard to all the circumstances, including the importance of maintaining the availability of the mobile communications service in the geographical area concerned and the effect of the cessation on users, the giving of authorisation is necessary and proportionate to its objectives. If that section was taken on its own, I would understand the Deputy having concerns that a reference to a serious threat might result in this provision being invoked by a Minister who believed people should not be allowed to demonstrate and that demonstrations posed a serious threat, but he has not read the definition of "serious threat":'serious threat' means an imminent threat that--(a) an explosive or other lethal device will be activated by use of a mobile communications services provided in the State by an undertaking; and (b) that activation of that explosive or other lethal device is likely to cause-- (i) death of a person; (ii) serious bodily injury to a person; or (iii) substantial damage to property. If a building is blown up, that may cause substantial injury to persons. The definition of "serious threat" has nothing to do with peaceful demonstration. I presume the Deputy does not suggest that if someone is participating in a peaceful demonstration who has planted a bomb and has a mobile device with which to detonate it, the State should ignore this. This is not an issue. People have a constitutional right to engage in peaceful demonstration through the constitutional right to assembly. It has been in the Constitution since 1937, which replicates provisions in the 1922 Constitution. The legislation provides in discrete and limited circumstances for a basic authorisation to facilitate members of An Garda Síochána in the context of a modern legal framework to save lives and prevent the detonation of bombs by those intent on murder and mayhem. It is not a unique provision, as it is to be found in legislation elsewhere. If it had been possible to bring forward the provision, for example, in a separate Bill, I would have done so. It had to go through the drafting process and we had to proof it. This all takes time to ensure we provide the necessary checks and balances and the provisions are not excessive. These provisions were not invented overnight.A significant amount of work must be done to get the balance right, to provide for how the exercise will be done and to deal with issues relating to telecommunications companies. There is no conspiracy in this; it is about protecting human life. I do not believe there is any reason we should be less concerned about protecting the lives of eight of the world's leaders who will be on this island together with all the individuals who will come with them as backup. That is important. It is equally important we protect the lives of everyone who lives on this island. It is important, for example, that if a criminal terrorist group, based on this island, either North or South, with nothing to do with the G8 meeting, decides to resort to this type of explosive device, we have the facility to use the powers that exist here to protect lives.

We differ in our views on it but I will respond once more to the points the Minister made and will leave it at that. If I understand him correctly, the Minister seems to be acknowledging that there is a link between the last minute bringing forward of these amendments and the proximity of the G8 summit. I find that timing a serious matter of concern, in particular where things are happening around the G8 summit which I do not believe are justified. It is extraordinary that it has been announced that a military base will be opened in the North to detain, or possibly detain, protestors and that special sittings of the courts will be held on a Sunday. It is really extraordinary that drone planes will be deployed, which we know best as planes deployed in Afghanistan with devastating consequences and around which there are very serious moral questions about their use at all. It is also extraordinary that 3,500 police will be brought over from Britain. Let us be honest, they are not short of police in the North in the first place. It is against this background that the Minister rushes in legislation which gives seriously draconian powers to the Minister to cut off mobile telephone communications if he or she believes there is a serious threat, as defined by him or her. I do not believe these things are coincidental, and the Minister seems to be acknowledging that there is a link. He asked if I was disputing protection for people from attack. Of course, there should be protection. I am opposed to terrorism and to unrepresentative minorities trying to use force to achieve political ends, but I do not believe there is any evidence that such a threat exists to the G8 summit in the North despite the level of mobilisation of security and police forces. In terms of the general level of hysteria being whipped up, these amendments are part of that because the legislation is being rushed through. Why rush it through other than to play our part in creating a certain type of atmosphere around the G8 summit? The big thing one needs to think about is the possibility of a conspiracy, to use the Minister's words, or a potential conspiracy to bomb the G8 summit. Has the Minister any evidence of, or has it been suggested to him by anybody, that such a threat exists that necessitated him rushing these amendments through? I would like to know. If the Minister said we have serious intelligence that such an attack might take place, that certain groups are believed to be active in considering such an attack and that this, therefore, justifies us bringing forward last minute amendments giving us these powers, we would at least have to take the discussion a bit more seriously but he has not said that, nor have I heard it said anywhere else. All we have is police, politicians and governments creating this massive security operation around the meeting of eight individuals. I do not believe it is justified but I believe there is a political purpose to it. I am afraid there is a history of this, and it is not a conspiracy. People in Italy will tell the Minister about a long history of using what is known as the strategy of tension in advance of protests in order to justify big police operations, usually resulting in confrontations at the time of the protests, and to portray protestors as people likely to engage in violent acts, or acts of violent confrontation. It creates a certain atmosphere which is not justified.  People will protest, and I will be one of them. There will be significant mobilisation in the North and in the South but it will be made up of anti-poverty groups, NGOs and trade unionists talking about issues of global poverty, militarisation and so on. We probably disagree on a lot of the issues but they are entirely legitimate points to be made. There is absolutely no doubt that this kind of thing will scare people and I do not think it is justified. I think the Minister and the police in the North know it will scare people when they hear 3,500 police will be mobilised. At a very simple level, if one is a parent and decides one wants to protest but thinks there is a possibility mobile telephone communications could be switched off for six hours while one is in Fermanagh and that there is a possibility one might not be able to telephone one's children if anything happens, there is absolutely no question but that would be a deterrent and certainly some people - maybe this Government - are conscious of that.  This has happened repeatedly around these summits. The Minister said there is evidence of people engaging in violent confrontation at these protests but there is not that much evidence. It is now emerging that the vast majority of the violence in Genoa was orchestrated by the Italian police, including some of the so-called protesters engaged in protests. There are serious investigations into police involvement in stirring up the violence in Genoa. I was there and that was very evident. Police columns came out of nowhere and brutally attacked peaceful protesters with the result that one of them, Carlo Giuliani, was killed. It is not paranoia; there is a record and experience of this. I do not believe this is justified on that basis. The Minister said the words "serious threat" refer specifically to explosion but the point is that he and the police authorities will be the ones who will decide what construes a serious threat.  Over the past decade or so - this is not something the Minister can dispute - there has been a pattern of talking about terrorist threats to justify various extraordinary measures, including massive military interventions, which have had pretty horrendous consequences. It, therefore, concerns me that language is now being bandied around in Ireland. We have a history of conflict in the North, of paramilitary groups and so on and the Minister is right to talk about the anniversary. The vast majority of people in the North do not want violence, which ended precisely because they did not want it.I do not think there is a particular threat from these groups to the G8. Perhaps the Minister might suggest there is evidence of such a threat. If the threat is not coming from them, where else in the country is it coming from? Do we really want to have these draconian powers and create this atmosphere when there is no such threat? I do not know whether the Minister, the American Government or the British Government are pressing for this. I do not know from where the pressure for it is coming. To my mind, it is absolutely unjustified. At the very least, it deserves more serious scrutiny. This should have happened over a longer period. It should not have been rushed just to facilitate the agenda of the G8.

I outlined my reasons during the earlier debate. If it has to be done once or twice in a 24-hour period, is there scope for the mobile phone companies to refuse to do it? I certainly hope not. What will happen if they are asked to stop providing blanket coverage, but they do not do so properly? Will they be able to seek compensation? Almost every child over the age of ten has a mobile phone, unfortunately. There is huge interest in this powerful business and I use it as much as anyone. As a resident of south Tipperary, I recall President Reagan's visit to Ballyporeen in 1984. We all remember President Obama's visit to Moneygall, near the Tipperary-Offaly border, two years ago. We need proper powers to deal with such visits. The people concerned might be involved in wars and other conflicts that we might or might not support. The threat might not come from this country; it could come from abroad. This country would be laughed at if something major were to happen and we were unable to provide security for the visiting dignitaries. We expect the same security for our leaders when they travel abroad. We want them to be safeguarded and minded. I remember the legislation passed after the O'Connell Street riots a few years ago. Incidentally, I was subsequently charged under that legislation. Thankfully, a jury in court found me totally innocent of any such charge. I think it related to directing terrorism. I saw a number of protests outside Leinster House last fall that were hijacked by a group called Éirígí and I happened to be in the middle of one of them. I got caught up in it when I was coming back to this House. Peaceful protest is being damaged. I fully support people's right to peaceful protest. I have spoken about this group in the House previously. It infiltrated a demonstration organised by certain politicians; its members got up on the backs of lorries to incite people. I saw them spitting at gardaí and belting them with flagpoles. They fired explosive crackers onto the ground to create flames which erupt within minutes. It was nasty. It is not acceptable for such persons to damage the right of peaceful protestors to raise various issues. I think one of the issues involved the pro-choice campaign and this crowd were there again. They were there another evening when a Bill was being debated here. It is alarming, worrying and disconcerting because they have no mandate. If people want to engage in a peaceful protest, they are entitled to do so. We cannot allow any small group to continually interrupt such demonstrations in order to cause bedlam and mayhem by attacking gardaí and protestors. They have to be reined in.

Deputy Mattie McGrath raised an important point. I draw his attention to amendment No. 18, which deals with offences. If a mobile phone company fails to comply with a direction issued to it, the individuals responsible will be liable to criminal prosecution. That is a very specific power. I will not respond at any great length to what Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett said, as we have both addressed the issue. He has his view and I have mine. I will draw certain matters to his attention. As Minister at the Departments of Justice and Equality and Defence, I am very conscious that the Garda and the Defence Forces, unfortunately, have a wealth of experience of dealing with threats posed by improvised explosive devices. These incidents do not receive a large amount of publicity and no one seeks publicity for them. In 2012 the Garda and the Defence Forces dealt with 96 such cases. The brave members of the Defence Forces were called out by the Garda on 96 occasions last year to deal with the threat of explosive devices. The Defence Forces deal with these matters with great professionalism and these incidents were dealt with very successfully. I hope the Deputy will understand that, for security reasons, it is not appropriate for me to elaborate further on them. We have a problem in this area, about which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett should be under no illusion. I am not saying I know of a major threat in relation to the G8 summit. I am saying we should apply the precautionary principle to ensure any tool necessary to protect human life is available to us. The G8 summit could become a focus for a group that might resort to the use of some sort of explosive device to make a point or a name for itself. It has nothing to do with peaceful demonstrators. I will be very happy to welcome to this country people of divergent political views who want to sit down to debate and discuss issues openly. It is often really important to challenge the conventional wisdom in these areas. When that happens, it is important for those who hold different views to be able to substantiate them. I have no difficulty with the arrival in this country of people whose views differ from those of the G8 leaders. I have no difficulty with people demonstrating peacefully. I emphasise that it should be peaceful - people's access to attend meetings should not be obstructed. I have no difficulty with people organising alternative meetings, debating issues and disagreeing with the G8 leaders. I have no difficulty with any of this. However, I have a duty as Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure we do what we can to protect human life. We have to keep our law in touch with modern technology. That is what this is about. It is about nothing more than this.

Its purpose is to clarify that the obligations which arise for a "relevant independent legal practitioner" as a designated person apply only when such practitioners are carrying out the services listed in the definition of "relevant independent legal professional" contained in section 24(1) of the 2010 Act.The Deputy should note that section 25 lists the designated persons to whom the obligations under the Act apply, and these include bodies such as credit and financial institutions, auditors and accountants, and relevant independent legal professionals. The latter is a group which includes barristers, solicitors and notaries and for whom the money laundering obligations only apply to the particular services specified in section 24(1). The obligations do not apply to any other legal service that a solicitor or barrister might provide to a client. I commend the amendment to the House.

Section 60(2)(b)(ii) of the Act of 2010 is amended by the substitution of "through officers and members" for "through officers, members or employees".".The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that a designated accountancy body is not obliged to act as the competent authority for a company purely because an employee of the company is a member of the designated accountancy body. Section 60 of the Act of 2010 sets out the competent authorities for the different types of designated persons. Such competent authorities include the Central Bank, designated accountancy bodies, the Law Society, the Bar Council and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality. Section 60(2)(b)(ii) provides that if the designated person - who is an auditor, external accountant, tax adviser or trust or company service provider - is not a member of a designated accountancy body and is either a body corporate or a body of unincorporated persons carrying out its functions through officers, members or employees who are members of a designated accountancy body, it is that designated accountancy body which takes the role of the competent authority. This amendment removes the reference to "employee" in that provision. The anti-money laundering compliance unit, AMLCU, of my Department, which has responsibility for monitoring the anti-money laundering obligations for a number of areas, will take on such a role for any such body concerned. I commend the amendment to the House.

Section 84 of the Act of 2010 is amended— (a) by the renumbering of the section as subsection (1), (b) by the insertion, in subsection (1), after the definition of “principal officer” of the following:“ ‘subsidiary’ has the meaning assigned to it by section 155 of the Companies Act 1963;”,and(c) by the insertion after subsection (1) of the following subsection:“(2) (a)Subject to paragraph (b), in this Chapter a reference to the Minister shall, in a case where the applicant for or the holder of an authorisation is a subsidiary of a credit or financial institution, be construed as a reference to the Central Bank of Ireland.(b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to—(i) section 88(5),(ii) sections 89(5)(b)(ii), 90(3)(b)(ii), 93(6)(b)(ii), 97(6)(b)(ii), 98(2)(b)(ii) and 100(2) in so far as those provisions relate to the specifying of a form by the Minister,(iii) section 94(3),(iv) section 101,(v) section 104(8),(vi) section 106(7).”.”.The purpose of these amendments is to provide that subsidiaries of a credit or financial institution operating as a trust or company service provider, known as a TCSP, are authorised and monitored by the Central Bank rather than myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality. Chapter 9 of the Act of 2010 deals with the authorisation of TCSPs which fall within my remit under that Act and includes detailed provisions in regard to the authorisation process. Section 84 provides that a credit or financial institution which carries out TCSP activities does not require authorisation under that chapter. The reason for this is the Central Bank is the competent authority for credit and financial institutions under this Act and already has wide-ranging regulatory and related functions in regard to such bodies under the Central Bank and related legislation. However, since the 2010 Act came into force, it has emerged that there are some subsidiaries of credit and financial institutions which are operating as TCSPs and, under the provisions of the Act, fall within my remit rather than the Central Bank. I believe the latter is the more appropriate authority. Amendment No. 7 deals with consequential technical amendments which are required to be made to sections 98, 103 and 104. I commend the amendments to the House.

It contains the power for a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, to issue a direction to an undertaking to cease providing mobile communications services. Subsection (1) requires a ministerial authorisation to be in force. It also requires the garda to be satisfied that the serious threat on which the authorisation was based continues to exist, and that other means are less likely to avert it. Directions must be issued in writing and signed. There is provision for oral directions in urgent cases, but confirmation in writing is required. The direction will specify the services to be ceased, the cessation period and the geographical area concerned. The direction may contain additional requirements necessary to averting the serious threat. The cessation period cannot be longer than that set in the Minister's authorisation and, in any case, cannot individually exceed six hours. The terms of a direction, other than the cessation period, can be varied, subject to the requirements in subsections (2) and (3). When issuing or varying a direction, the member of the Garda Síochána must limit the effect of the cessation on the public to the minimum necessary to avert the threat. Amendment No. 16, which provides for section 22, provides that where the member of the Garda Síochána who issued the direction considers that the direction is no longer necessary, the member must withdraw it without delay and notify the undertaking, which is, obviously, the communications company. To protect the necessary secrecy of counter-terrorist and security operations, amendment No. 14, which relates to section 20, provides that the likelihood of an imminent authorisation or direction may not be disclosed. In addition, the content or existence of a direction or authorisation may not be disclosed prior to the cessation period and the content may not be disclosed even after that period. This will allow mobile phone companies to explain the cessation of service to customers after the fact, should such explanation be necessary, by referring to the existence of a direction, but without disclosing its content. Subsection (3) of this proposed section requires undertakings to endeavour to continue to provide emergency service calls. The technology is available, if not yet fully in place, for mobile telephone companies to maintain the availability of 999 services while otherwise effectively shutting down their networks. We will be looking to mobile phone companies to fully live up to their obligations under this subsection. I should also note that landline to landline calls will not be affected by directions and are not encompassed by the terms of the Bill. Amendment No. 15, which relates to section 21, places similar non-disclosure obligations as apply to undertakings on other persons in regard to the existence and content of authorisations and directions. I commend the amendments to the House.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	In recent years, there has been a continuing series of legal challenges to the JLC and registered employment agreement, REA, systems, including the 2011 Grace Fried Chicken case that resulted in the High Court striking down all employment regulation orders, EROs, and the recent Supreme Court ruling in respect of REAs.  As the Deputies will be aware, on 1 August last, a new legal framework for REAs and EROs was put in place by way of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012. The Act provided for a comprehensive suite of measures to strengthen their constitutional and legal framework, to allow for enhanced flexibility of application and to restore and underpin the protections afforded to workers. The recent Supreme Court judgment held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1° of the Constitution. That article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that REAs were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals, subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of law-making functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what was permissible under the Constitution.  The effect of this decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. In consequence, the Labour Court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements. As a result, all such agreements no longer have any application beyond the subscribing parties and are not enforceable in law. However, existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by REAs are unaffected.  There were six existing sectoral REAs registered or varied by the Labour Court in recent years. It is estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 workers were covered by these sectoral agreements. In addition, there were more than 50 employment agreements covering individual enterprises that had been registered. The striking down of the REAs means that new employees in these sectors can now be hired at a rate agreed between workers and their employers. This is subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. From the parties' perspective, REAs established industry terms and conditions and provided a sense of certainty when tendering. They were recognised under European Union law and, through the posted workers directive, ensured that contractors from outside the jurisdiction, who may be using employees from lower wage economies, did not obtain an advantage over local contractors in terms of wage costs. This is a significant judgment that requires careful consideration and I have asked the Attorney General to advise on all issues. That advice is awaited as is the order of the Supreme Court and, until these are received, I am not in a position to indicate what, if any, legislative response may be required.

That gives such companies a huge competitive advantage over those companies that are part of the REA and have contractual obligations to it. As long as there is some sort of doubt over this, that competitive advantage will grow and there will be a loss of existing employment and existing terms and conditions. Is it planned to implement legislation before the summer recess or will this be allowed to drag on into the autumn and companies that are currently signed up to the REA will suffer loss of contracts and an inability to be competitive in applying for tenders because they are adhering to the REA and their contractual obligations? Has the Minister any emergency legislation on this issue under consideration?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	300	This Supreme Court action was taken under the 1946 Act. It was not taken under the Act passed in 2012. It preceded that. That is important in terms of timing. In drafting the 2012 Act, we were aware of this pending action and have sought to make the legislation robust to such challenges. Obviously, we have not yet got a final order from the Supreme Court nor have we got advice from the Attorney General so I will not speculate on any of those avenues about which the Deputy is asking. In respect of the transfer of the questions to the Department of Finance, these are matters of ministerial responsibility in different areas but there are questions on access to finance down here which I am answering later on the floor.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	301	I emphasise that there is a serious lacuna here for companies that adhere to their contractual obligations under the REA system and continue in good faith despite the striking down of the REA, as opposed to other companies that will now use the competitive advantage open to them while that space is there. The Minister said the REAs were not enforceable in law and there is now a huge competitive advantage open to companies in terms of tendering for major projects while that lacuna exists. It is a matter of urgency that needs to be addressed as soon as the Minister has the Supreme Court order and the information from the Attorney General.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	302	I accept that but I presume that the REAs must renew under the new legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	The special assignee relief programme, SARP, is a tax concession for the temporary placement in Ireland of senior executives currently employed elsewhere by a multinational company. In essence, if we can attract the correct strategic senior executives to Ireland, he or she may bring hundreds more jobs. The business case for SARP is to make it easier for companies to locate strategic leaders in Ireland for a short-term assignment in order to facilitate the establishment of job-creating opportunities in Ireland. Rapid and successful ramp up of projects frequently requires such assignments. It is regarded by the IDA as an important tool in attracting mobile investment and in facilitating its successful delivery of targets in Ireland.  In advance of budget 2012, I received representations from the independent enterprise development agencies - Forfás, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland - for improvements to SARP. As the Deputy will be aware, SARP was improved and streamlined in budget 2012. I received further similar representations from the enterprise development agencies for further improvements in advance of budget 2013. The pre-budget 2012 and 2013 submissions of a wide range of industry representative organisations, for example, IBEC and the American Chamber of Commerce, included recommendations to improve SARP. The CEO of the IDA has called for improvements to SARP in order to strengthen the tools Ireland uses to attract, retain and develop foreign direct investment.  The various pre-budget submissions received have called for improvements to the attractiveness of SARP. My pre-budget 2013 submission to the Minister for Finance called for a reduction in the personal tax rate under SARP from 35.7% to 30%. Technically, it was proposed that this would be achieved via a 23% income tax rate together with the 7% universal social charge. Such an improvement would strengthen the ability of Ireland's SARP to be used as a tool in attracting foreign direct investment. The five-year lower personal tax rate under SARP is targeted at individuals currently working outside of Ireland. Many of the senior executives claiming tax relief under SARP would not have moved to Ireland if it were not for SARP. The costs of SARP are more than offset via the economic benefits. Many other jurisdictions against which Ireland competes for foreign direct investment have SARP-type personal tax incentives to attract senior executives. Ireland is in a jobs crisis and we must do whatever we can to attract and create jobs.

Ireland is in a jobs crisis and we must do everything we can to promote jobs. What we need to do is create sustainable competitive advantages so that we can compete with any other country in the world with regard to foreign direct investment.However, on many occasions this Government has chosen the unsustainable competitive advantage route. The proposal for an income tax of 23% for those earning up to €500,000 is unsustainable in a number of ways. It is unsustainable with regard to low and middle income earners who are being taxed to the hilt in order to carry the weight of the economy. Ireland was mentioned in London last week and in Washington yesterday in the context of Google and Apple, respectively. The leadership of Apple, under oath, said there were deals for major tax incentives between this Government and that company. These incentives are completely unsustainable. Instead of such companies being incentivised to develop jobs in this country they are setting up smaller units, pushing exports through those units and they are not properly paying taxes on those units. Will the Minister come clean and say whether his Government has any tax incentive deals, whatsoever, with any multinational company?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	305	The companies to which the Deputy refers, Google and Apple, between them employ more than 6,000 people in Ireland. These are real substantive companies providing significant employment and they are very competitive players. I repeat what the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance said: there are no special deals under our tax code with any company. This is categorically the truth. As the Deputy knows, our tax code is statute based. All the measures are enshrined in statute in the Finance Act and are fully transparent. There are no special negotiated rates. I will not speculate as to the situation in the past but I suspect that in 1980, under export sales relief, there was a special sectoral scheme in the sense that exports did not attract tax at that stage. This may be what is being referred to. I dispute absolutely the Deputy's suggestion that we are seeking to build companies that do not have sustainable competitive advantage in Ireland. Companies are in Ireland because of the talent, technology and track record. Indeed, the special assignee relief programme, SARP, is used in many countries to bring in strategic people who can build short-term projects which will result in long-term job creation. It is a completely acceptable approach.

I refer to utility costs which are higher in Ireland than the average in the rest of Europe, such as waste management and water costs. There is a need to provide an educated society so we can attract jobs but funding is being pulled out of the education system. Broadband infrastructure is needed to allow companies to communicate. These elements are necessary to create long-term competitive advantages which will attract jobs to this country. Unfortunately, Ireland is regarded internationally as a tax haven by gaining competitive advantage in foreign direct investment on the basis of a very low tax base. Will the Minister give his views on the suggestion that Ireland's reputation has been damaged, as seen in the evidence given under oath by a senior Apple executive that a deal was done between his company and this State to confer tax advantages on his company?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	307	I am surprised at the Deputy's remarks. I should not need to tell any Member of the Oireachtas that there are no deals in our tax regime. I am sure the Deputy was party to the debates on the Finance Bill. Our legislation is set out clearly. There are no special deals with any company. Such special deals apply in some countries which are competitors of ours which spin their own tax deals for individual projects. It is the categoric truth that this never happens in Ireland. This country is categorically not a tax haven. Tax havens have been defined clearly by the OECD. Ireland is co-operating with the OECD in ensuring that there is not artificial movement of profits. There is an international study of how companies pay their taxes. I am surprised the Deputy would take as gospel the word of some politician from another jurisdiction who accuses us of being a tax haven. That is not the case; Ireland is not a tax haven and never has been. I agree that we need sustainable competitive advantage. Last October, Sinn Féin talked about having a €13 billion spend. However, at budget time only a couple of months later, that had evaporated from its programme-----

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	310	I have been informed by IDA Ireland that, in the period from January 2012 to date, five of the six site visits by potential investors to south Tipperary visited the vacant Cordis facility in Cashel. These visits were from new companies visiting the location and region for the first time and from senior executives of existing client companies. IDA Ireland has confirmed that it is actively promoting the vacant Cordis facility as a modern biopharmaceutical-medical technology facility. I understand that the building is an IMB-audited facility, with fully equipped analytical quality control and development laboratories, as well as office-administration space. It has high-specification clean room space and flexible production space. It is a large facility - 16,600 sq. m - with ample expansion space. It is a modern facility that is readily adaptable for use as a medical technology or biopharmaceutical facility, particularly a convergent technology development and manufacturing facility. This specification serves to align it with current requirements in the life sciences sector - for example, clinical trial production and commercial process development of next-generation medical devices or biologics taking place in a location that has the competencies required to scale up to commercial manufacturing and to meet exacting regulatory authorisation requirements. IDA Ireland has confirmed that in addition, Johnson and Johnson corporate real estate services division is marketing the building. It has appointed an agent in Ireland with a view to seeking alternative users from within the Johnson and Johnson group of companies, particularly from other business units with no prior presence in Ireland. The pharmaceutical-biopharmaceutical sector today employs in the region of 25,000 people in Ireland and is a very significant contributor to the economy as measured by exports, corporate tax and Irish economy expenditure, in addition to direct employment. Internationally the industry is undergoing significant transformation from traditional pharmaceutical drugs based on small molecules to biopharmaceutical drugs based on large molecules. It is forecast that by 2016, seven of the top ten blockbuster drugs will be biologics.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
In recent years, IDA Ireland has had a sustained marketing focus on the biotechnology sector and as a result the agency has successfully attracted and developed globally leading programmes from companies such as Allergan, Amgen, Centocor, Eli Lilly, Genzyme, Merck, Biomarin and Pfizer. Ireland now has a globally leading biopharmaceutical cluster in the next generation of pharmaceutical products. Over the past ten years Ireland has seen 15 major investments in biopharma manufacturing. Based on some recent announcements an average investment of
€400 million is not untypical
and the average per project is of the order of 200 high-value manufacturing jobs. These investments have mitigated Ireland’s exposure to the patent cliff on older products. From across its existing companies, IDA continues to win large scale investments in product development and capability building to take on new product mandates. Ireland already has successful generic manufacturers such as Clonmel Healthcare, Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Teva and Rowa. These companies have operated successfully from Ireland competing with low cost competition for many years. Some of these investments also have a big construction impact.

I note there have been a number of visits to this site and Johnson and Johnson is helping in the search for a new tenant for this facility. Foreign direct investment has resulted in the creation of new jobs and the availability of a modern state-of-the-art plant at Cashel, the former Cordis plant, must make the search easier. Jobs are very badly needed in south Tipperary. IDA Ireland produced only ten new jobs in south Tipperary last year. Other plants in the county have seen significant job losses. The current unemployment statistics for the county are horrendous. In the town of Cashel, unemployment has increased from just under 400 in 2008 to 1,200 currently. The situation is the same in other towns around the county.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	I wish to assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland is working very hard to find an occupier.This is a fantastic facility in a cluster that is recognised for life sciences. In south Tipperary alone, eight IDA client companies employ 3,500 people. It is important to emphasise that aspect. The fact that it is a fantastic cluster will enhance the opportunity to find an occupier for the facility as will the fact that 3,500 people are working in IDA companies in the region. This is about the promotion of the region which has a major regional advantage given the existence of the cluster. The IDA is actively bringing people to see the facility, with five of the six companies having visited it. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is actively discussing the matter with the IDA every chance he gets. There is a great opportunity here. The Minister sits on the south east forum and employment in the region is very much a critical focus of Government. I am very confident about this facility given the emphasis of the Government on the south east, the location of the life science cluster and the fact that 3,500 people are already employed in eight IDA client companies in the region.

These companies are prepared to liaise and partner with incoming foreign direct investment companies at the state-of-the-art site at Cashel. I appeal to the Minister and Minister of State to make every effort to ensure that a tenant is obtained for the facility as soon as possible and, in any event, before the end of the year.

The IDA does an outstanding job on behalf of the economy to bring in top-calibre, high-tech companies, especially in the life sciences. Johnson and Johnson is a huge organisation which is working actively with the IDA and has appointed personnel. I emphasise to Deputy Healy the clear message that the Government and the IDA is prioritising the facility in every way possible. It is a state-of-the-art facility, at which five companies have looked. The intention of Government is to ensure that getting an occupier for this fantastic facility is an IDA priority in the south east. We are doing everything we can to make that happen.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	316	The potential of the manufacturing sector has been neglected in recent years. In consequence, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, I established a manufacturing forum chaired by Patrick Miskelly and supported by an analysis team in Forfás to develop a detailed strategy for manufacturing, which I launched last month along with a separate strategy on the skill needs of manufacturing prepared by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. More than 205,000 people are now employed in manufacturing, which makes a very substantial contribution to the economy in terms of exports, purchase of materials and services, regional spread and innovation. The report makes clear that a do-nothing strategy could lead to continuing job losses in the sector and sets out a strategy which the authors believe to have the potential to create 20,000 jobs by 2016. This is an ambitious target. The report identifies four areas of opportunity including sectors with potential, adapting and responding to changing global supply chains, developing and adapting new technologies and materials and developing the indigenous potential for start-up companies and scaling. Key actions are proposed across a range of areas, including access to new funding, management training and support, cost reduction, technology adoption, extending international reach, improving innovation capacity, developing skills bases and the implementation of a national step change initiative. The policy sets out eight distinct policy areas involving 63 actions in all. These actions include new start-up and capability funds to be run by Enterprise Ireland specifically to target supports for new manufacturing start-ups and to support capital investment by manufacturing companies. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are to target additional financial supports for research and development investments specifically at engineering firms. Also included is a new national step change initiative available to all Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies which will systematically support manufacturing companies to expand their client bases through staff training and peer learning, improve their adoption of new technologies, embrace research and development and accelerate collaboration between companies in similar sectors to generate greater efficiencies in areas like global sourcing.

In 2012, manufacturing companies exported €79 billion of merchandise and sourced €14 billion of produce from within the island. It is a hugely important sector and I welcome the focus the Minister has put on it. The challenge now is to put substance behind that focus. The Forfás recommendations include a start-up fund for manufacturing enterprises and financial support for capital investment by manufacturing enterprises. Does the Minister intend to prioritise those recommendations within his own budget campaign, which is under way ahead of the October budget? Will there be a funding allocation and will Enterprise Ireland receive an extra allocation in 2014 specifically intended for the manufacturing sector to ensure that the recommendations from the excellent Forfás report are implemented? Is the Minister still confident that he will reach the target of 20,000 extra manufacturing jobs by 2016?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	318	There will be specific directed measures as I have outlined for start-up and capability funds directly targeted at the manufacturing sector. In addition, we will be using the funds we have launched, including the seed fund, small and medium enterprise fund, innovation fund and the development capital fund, to target manufacturing companies. Taken together, those funds come to €2 billion of funding supported by the State with private partnerships. Using those funds to address access to finance problems within manufacturing will be important. I am very motivated to see the national step change initiative rolled out. It is about getting companies to step up their ambitions. Enterprise Ireland companies are really performing well, diversifying the direction of their exports, moving into new markets and improving their technology. While I am confident that we can deliver on the target, it will depend on the international environment, etc. Ours is a small and open trading economy. We have set an ambitious path with the strategy group which remains together to help us implement it. I am confident that we will make an impact.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	319	I welcome the Minister's confidence. Has he given consideration to the increase in labour costs in what were previously developing economies, to which a great deal of manufacturing was outsourced in the middle part of the last decade, and has he identified any competitive advantage that may be derived from that labour cost increase and quality issues in those countries that may assist him in reaching the target? Does the Minister think 20,000 is perhaps an unambitious target and could he force it up to 30,000 given the amount of money being invested in the sector at the moment?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	320	The target was set on the basis of the analysis carried out by Forfás supported by active industrialists in the sector. The strategy shows that the changing nature of globalisation is opening up opportunities. We are moving to a more personalised, customised form of manufacturing, which creates opportunities. This year, we are setting a target within the action plan of €500 million in additional global sourcing from within the supply chains of companies that are already in Ireland. There is a rich vein for us to develop here. The target set is ambitious and we will work towards it. As the Deputy rightly says, it is about the implementation and rolling out of change. Lifting our companies is what we are seeking to do. I am fully committed to making this work.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14777	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	All the work which the Government is doing through the Action Plan for Jobs aims to transform our economy from one that became over dependent on property, construction and debt to one focused on enterprise, innovation and exports. The Action Plan for Jobs is focused on sustaining and creating employment for new entrants to the labour market and the unemployed, many of whom are under 25. There is strong evidence that the plan is working. The IDA has had the best two years in a decade for jobs growth while Enterprise Ireland companies are winning new markets and growing employment significantly. Over the past 15 months, the private sector has added 1,000 jobs per month. While it is true that there are continued job losses in more traditional sectors that grew disproportionately during the credit bubble, such as construction, financial, insurance and administrative activities, we have seen an increase in employment in sectors targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs, including ICT, digital gaming, tourism and the agrifood sector.Many of the jobs on offer in these sectors are particularly attractive to young people. In addition, the Government has a range of initiatives to support young people to prepare for employment through job experience and training. These include provision by the Department of Social Protection for over 85,000 job placement, work experience and back to education beneficiaries in 2012, and the JobBridge internship scheme, which has had over 17,400 participants to date, with over 60% of participants securing jobs after their internships. Some 6,077 interns were participating last week and a further 2,189 internships were offered by companies. In Springboard, over 200 courses are available throughout the country designed to meet current and future skills needs in Ireland and in the momentum programme, specific projects will also be available to those under 25 to assist them to enter or return to employment. Other initiatives include the ICT action plan, offering training and conversion courses for the ICT sector and the EU youth guarantee being developed by the Minister for Social Protection.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
My Department is also keen to support young entrepreneurs and, in this context, initiatives such as Enterprise Ireland’s competitive start fund and new frontiers programme, along with the microenterprise loan fund, will all contribute to supporting young entrepreneurs. Last week, we commenced a consultation on how we can better promote entrepreneurship in Ireland and we will be looking in particular at the scope to increase youth entrepreneurship. The Government recognises that there has been an increase in net emigration, particularly among young people, since the start of the recession. In the year to April 2012 net migration reached 34,000, of whom 26,000 were Irish nationals. This reflects the impact of the crash which over a three-year period saw the loss of over 250,000 jobs in the private sector. The concerted drive to make employment a top priority across the whole of Government is helping to alter that outlook for employment. Employment in the private sector is now growing by 1,000 per month. The Government’s aim is that, by continuing the process of transforming our economy step by step through the Action Plan for Jobs, we can provide opportunities for employment in Ireland.

Choice is about options and having the ability to choose between working here and working abroad. With the level of unemployment here, for many it is not a choice. In the two years to the end of 2012, 25,000 people under the age of 25 lost their jobs. In those two years, 38,000 people under the age of 25 left the workforce. It is clear that a significant sector of Irish society and the youth cohort have lost their jobs and left the workforce entirely. They have been forced to emigrate. I do not know if the Minister of State has had the opportunity to read the excellent report from the National Youth Council of Ireland in the past ten days. It states that 300,000 people have emigrated in the past four years.

It is very important that people realise the gravity of what is involved. I ask the Minister of State the timescale for replacing the jobs lost by 25,000 people up to the end of last year. When will the youth guarantee be implemented and will part of it be a guarantee of a job?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14777	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	325	I will provide some figures and interrogate them correctly. I acknowledge the report to which Deputy Tóibín refers. Of the 87,000 people who have emigrated from Ireland in the year up to April 2012, less than half of them, 40,600 people, were not Irish. Many of them were non-Irish people who came to Ireland over the previous decade or so for work and are now returning home. The CSO figures show 53,000 people came to Ireland last year and 20,600 were Irish nationals returning home. Extrapolating from the figures, the years from 1992 to 2012 show a certain number of Irish people choosing to emigrate for career or personal reasons. I beg indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	326	I will call the Minister of State again.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14777	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	We must distinguish between the gross figure and the net figure and extrapolate the number of people who are not Irish and who are returning to their home countries to provide a more realistic view. With regard to youth unemployment, of the 68,000 people within the age category to which Deputy Tóibín refers up to 2012, the 15 to 19 year old category contains 18,500 people who are unemployed, with 49,500 in the 21 to 24 year old category. The idea of these schemes and the best way to ensure people do not emigrate is to ensure there is a place for people to reskill, retrain or remain within formal education. That gives them the best chance of an opportunity. There is a myriad of schemes, training programmes and educational places doing that at present.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	328	Many of the people in the figures are not Irish nationals. They may be Polish or Lithuanian people who came to Ireland, worked here for ten years, put down roots, raised families and then found themselves unable to get a job. We are entitled to use those figures to reflect the economic situation. These people should not be left out of the economic figures when trying to get an understanding of the health of the economy. The net figures show a major outflow of people from the State due to the economic situation. The point we make is that we can create as many programmes as we like but the question of whether the Government tackles three issues - collapsed demand, infrastructural gaps that need investment and the major costs and inefficiencies in doing business in the State vis-à-vis our competitors - will determine whether we get back on our feet with regard to the creation of jobs. We need over 2% growth in the State to create jobs. The economy will create jobs, not a proliferation of jobs action plans, etc. Perhaps the Minister of State forgot to reply on the last occasion on my question of when the youth guarantee will be in place and whether the Government will include as part of it the guarantee of a job.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14777	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	329	The bottom line is that we want as many young people to be given the opportunity and we must create a supply of courses and upskilling. Let us take the figure of 18,500 in the 15 to 19 year old category. Why are 18,500 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 unemployed? There is no reason they cannot fit into a course, a placement, an internship or continuing education to ensure we can extrapolate from the figure of 18,500, which would cause a serious dent in the youth unemployment figure. The same applies to the category of those aged 20 to 24. When figures are quoted, the language being used refers to Irish people emigrating. It is important to interrogate the figures and extrapolate from them because there is a natural rate of people who are welcome to this country, who work in this country and will return to their native lands.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14777	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	331	It is important to acknowledge it. The demand side issue to which the Deputy refers is being tackled. The Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of regulatory measures to encourage business. It is acknowledged that demand has bottomed out but the Government is trying to put in place a set of measures to address the 250,000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2011. These jobs were allied, for the most part, to the construction sector so we must invest in new areas of opportunity in the sector. Those young people, who are working in mines in Australia as we speak because they have construction-related degrees, will come back and have other areas of opportunity. The Government is not resting on its laurels.With regard to the youth guarantee, it is my understanding - and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, can clarify it further - that this is still part of the negotiations under the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	332	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 14 and 16 together. While there is obviously limited scope for the State to be involved in the promotion of products generally, whether on an all-Ireland basis or not, and there are significant EU constraints on giving favourable treatment towards Irish produce, nevertheless the Government is very conscious of the additional difficulties facing companies in the Border region and also of the desirability of encouraging firms to expand their focus to pursue opportunities on an all-island basis. It is vital that we achieve improved competitiveness for such firms, which have faced additional challenges in the past. The key mechanism to drive this agenda is the work of the cross-Border body
InterTradeIreland, one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. InterTradeIreland’s remit includes work on trade, business development and related matters. As many issues affect a company’s decision to engage in cross-Border trading, the work of InterTradeIreland is designed to help eliminate barriers, encouraging firms to test-bed trading with the other jurisdiction on the island which, ultimately, may lead to these firms engaging in exporting to overseas markets.
InterTradeIreland’s range of programmes to assist this process includes practical supports to businesses such as a first stop shop
which provides companies with information on what they need to know about doing cross-Border business. This includes the provision of a practical guide and also providing trade accelerator vouchers
which offer companies financial support worth £1,000 or €1,200 towards professional advice in areas such as taxation, employment law, currency, sales, marketing or regulation. The voucher allows a company to redeem the cost of practical advice. In addition, InterTradeIreland provides extensive business, market and industry sector information. Other relevant programmes operated by InterTradeIreland include Acumen, which stimulates cross-Border trade by assisting SMEs with tailored consultancy and salary support mechanisms for market builders across the island, and Innova, which is aimed at stimulating, promoting and supporting research and development co-operation between firms North and South, with the support of public research organisations where required. Participation in any of InterTradeIreland’s
initiatives can help improve a company’s overall competitiveness. The effectiveness of InterTradeIreland’s
programmes
is borne out by the fact that over the past two years these programmes have helped create 1,012 jobs and have generated a business value of €224 million in terms of additional sales, efficiency gains and investments made. In addition to the work of InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland works closely with its counterpart organisation, Invest Northern Ireland,
on a range of initiatives to benefit enterprise development in the Border region. These include activities such as Bridging the Border seminars and partnering events, which are designed to promote joint opportunities between firms North and South in areas such as licensing and commercial agreements, subcontracting, technical co-operation and business partnerships. Clients of Invest Northern Ireland can participate on Enterprise Ireland programmes such as Leadership4Growth and the International Selling programme. Clients of both agencies can access market services, trade fairs, seminars and market development programmes provided by each agency. My Department will continue to work with InterTradeIreland and the other enterprise agencies on developing appropriate supports that encourage cross-Border trade.

That is the level of development that has taken place in the last 12 years. InterTradeIreland is an output of the Good Friday Agreement and the negotiations in which my party was involved. I worked for it indirectly 14 years ago. Everything in that reply regarding InterTradeIreland has had no input from this Government. There has been no increase in the number of people working for InterTradeIreland. There is a cap on its staffing level so its ability to grow to the needs of the Irish economy is stifled. There has been a fall in North-South trade in the last number of years. The Border region is suffering more than most in this economic downturn. What advance has the Government made with regard to an all-Ireland fuel price? For people who are competing with each other on both sides of the Border where is the level playing field in respect of an all-Ireland VAT rate? Why is it that the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland have offices all around the world and sometimes in the same cities? When will the Government use the resources on this island in an efficient manner to promote enterprise on this island? With regard to farming, does a lamb from Louth taste any different to a lamb from Armagh? The Irish product is seen as an Irish product internationally and until we start to use the efficiencies of the all-Ireland economy we will not be able to create the jobs that could be created in such an economy.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	334	InterTradeIreland was set up develop trade within Ireland and to address the disadvantaged areas of cross-Border trade. Obviously, there is a very good working relationship with the Northern Ireland Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, and with all relevant Ministers. I have been to InterTradeIreland. The body has been insulated from cutbacks, unlike other agencies in the State which have had cutbacks in staffing. The North-South body's objective is to encourage North-South business activity, which is what it is doing. InterTradeIreland currently supports 3,500 companies in the area of technology transfer. It also supports marketing and developing export potential. A strong part of its expertise is the collaboration with Enterprise Ireland. There is great potential in the voucher scheme. Enterprise Ireland provides innovation vouchers and companies in both the North and South can avail of them. There is also the potential of INTERREG, which is funded by my Department as well. It assists enterprise development and community regeneration. There is a group from Sligo and the North visiting the House today with regard to cross-Border co-operation and community economic regeneration. There is a fantastic opportunity for developing community enterprise. I compliment InterTradeIreland for the outstanding job it does. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I have been there and we have met the Minister, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA. There is a huge level of political co-operation and a great deal of activity at trade fairs. I attended the Seedcorn competition in Belfast a number of months ago. It is an outstanding success, with companies from the North and South participating jointly and doing business. That also happens at trade fairs. I am not sure where the Deputy is getting his information. There is a great deal of activity taking place with InterTradeIreland.

However, InterTradeIreland would continue to function in the same way today if the Minister of State or Fine Gael did not exist. What has the Minister of State brought to the table with regard to the development of all-Ireland trade? Throughout his reply there was no detail about new developments regarding all-Ireland integration and the development of the economy on an all-Ireland basis. There are great efficiencies we can use to promote our businesses internationally. The last Government conducted some trade missions internationally in which it allowed businesses from the North to get involved, and trade missions from the North included businesses from the South on international trade missions. There have been tentative steps but there appears to be a ceiling on that development and that ceiling has not been broken by this Government. If we wish to energise the region on both sides of the Border to maximise its potential for industry and job creation, we must start thinking not about what is already there and allowing it to continue as it is, but about breaking that ceiling and creating an all-Ireland economy.

The Government will strongly support that.The EIF, the representatives of which I met in the past two weeks, is considering developing a fund that would support cross-Border enterprise. There are opportunities. Mr. Hunter McGowan of InterTradeIreland is doing a fantastic job. I met the board of directors and the relevant companies. Most important, I met the business people and the staff who are employed. The 3,500 companies should be asked what is different now compared with the past. The Government is creating the environment to support jobs and talking to the relevant agencies. Enterprise Ireland does a fantastic job, as does Invest Northern Ireland. INTERREG personnel are working actively on the ground. The bodies are working in partnership with business people and communities. The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, has been having cross-Border meetings with Ms Foster, whom I met at a major launch a number of months ago. She is very much focused on the development of the body which is one of the most successful delivering on an all-island mandate to create and retain jobs and explore the potential for export on the part of high-potential start-up companies, which is very important. It is a question of exploring on a cross-Border basis the possibility of exporting to Europe and farther afield. I suggest the Deputy read the Horizon 2020 document. The Government will be pursuing that agenda which will clearly benefit companies in the North and the South.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	The credit supply clearing group was established in May 2009 to identify patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appeared to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns. The group worked to provide a clear picture of emerging lending patterns, while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interested parties in addressing problems. It was chaired by my Department and included representatives of the banking and business sectors, with departmental representatives and representatives of the primary support agencies. The group met on eight occasions and the last meeting was held on 19 April 2010. On foot of the work of the credit supply clearing group, the former Government established the Credit Review Office which took over the role of the credit supply clearing group in terms of identifying emerging lending patterns and credit supply solutions relating to these patterns, while at the same time facilitating direct discussion with the relevant interests in addressing these problems. Access to finance remains a critical element of the current Government’s economic recovery strategy. Oversight and monitoring by the Government are maintained by a Cabinet sub-committee on mortgage arrears and credit availability, of which I am a member. Policy development is supported by a Department of Finance-led State bodies group and a funding consultation forum which includes all relevant stakeholders and comprises representatives of the banking and business sectors, with departmental representatives and representatives of the primary support agencies. The terms of reference of the committee are centred on understanding, exploring and resolving the difficulties facing SMEs seeking credit. The collapse of the banks has made it more difficult for SMEs to access credit. In response to this challenge the Government has implemented several policy initiatives: the micro-enterprise loan fund and the credit guarantee scheme; the establishment of the development capital scheme, targeted at mid-sized indigenous firms, with a total available fund of €225 million; the development by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, of a range of support funds for the SME sector, totalling €850 million; the provision of €175 million of new Exchequer funding through the seed and venture capital schemes - this is leveraged for such projects up to approximately €700 million in line with experience; the pursuit of collaborative initiatives with the European Investment Bank such as the provision of a loan guarantee for some of the Microfinance Ireland portfolio; the Credit Review Office has been strengthened and is now overturning over half of the decisions appealed to it. While surveys reveal rising demand for SME credit and a decline in bank refusal rates, the challenge remains substantial. As the issue of access to credit remains a major concern for Irish business, the Government maintains a close watch on developments in the area. The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 sets out a number of actions to continue to address matters in the coming year.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	346	Some of my transferred questions were to seek the Minister's views on whether the Credit Review Office had sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate. What are the Minister's views on the success of the office to date? One of my questions sought clarification on whether the Minister agreed there should be formal targets for the banks in respect of debt resolution for SMEs similar to those pertaining to mortgage arrears. I will cheekily ask the Minister these questions now if he can answer them. It is important to indicate that the February report from the Central Bank on SME lending showed that, of a total of €8 billion in new lending advanced by the pillar banks, only an estimated €2.5 billion was deemed to be new lending, with the balance constituting loans that had been rolled over. Therefore, only €2.5 billion represented new money to support new projects. The pillar banks' SME loan books contracted by €2 billion in 2012 as the €2.5 billion in new lending was outweighed by €4.5 billion in net repayments. Therefore, we are still in very serious circumstances and there are no signs of a resolution. While the rate of refusal may be declining, it continues to be the case that there are no submissions. Individuals are being advised by local branch management not to proceed with their loan applications because they will not get anywhere. We all know this. No amount of enterprise weeks or radio programmes concerning bank branches will get the Minister beyond that issue. Businesses must submit formal applications to get into the credit review process. However, when they are being told by their relationship managers not to submit one, they are in a very difficult position. With regard to legacy debt of SMEs, particularly on property, will the Minister consider proposing to the Minister for Finance that targets be set for resolving the issue?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	347	That is quite a range of questions. The Credit Review Office is working extremely well. The real issue is that we need to see more businesses appealing decisions. There have been approximately 25,000 credit refusal decisions in total, not enough of which have been appealed, either internally in the bank or to the Credit Review Office. A strong message to businesses that are refused credit is that they should pursue appeals. I would be very disturbed if there were any suggestion relationship managers were discouraging this, as the Deputy suggested. We are seeking to ensure banks will outline clearly in writing as a standard part of their responses the right to appeal and the availability of alternative loan mechanisms such as the loan guarantee and micro-finance. The resources of the Credit Review Office are being strengthened. That was part of the decision at budget time by the Minister for Finance. The Central Bank is developing debt resolution targets for the banks. It is addressing this issue in much the same way as it addressed mortgages. It is recognised that we need to see viable businesses put back on a footing where they can continue to develop. I fully acknowledge what the Deputy is saying on the low level of new funding for SMEs. This is the issue we are targeting. As the Deputy stated, there is only €2.5 billion in new lending to SMEs. As the Deputy knows, the Government has put roughly €2.5 billion in SME funds into place through various models to supplement this. However, we need to see more activity by the banks in this regard. On the last comment, the overall stock of debt is declining for SMEs. The issues to be examined are new lending and restructuring. Restructuring is not all bad. That some lending amounts to restructuring is not bad because it is a way of resolving some of the issues that arise. We need, however, to continue to focus on this issue. That is what we will do in the course of the year.

While it is still a problem that applications are not being submitted, the review of a submitted application may be dragged out for months such that the project for which finance is originally sought may no longer be viable. The business may actually have moved on. Will the Minister put turnaround targets in place in order that the pillar banks will have to revert to applicants with a full decision within, perhaps, four working weeks rather than stringing out businesses? I could provide the Minister with many cases in which businesses have been strung out for nearly 12 months from the time of applying for a facility until the reaching of a decision. In many cases, that decision is negative.

It is not just a case of banks' lines of credit and Government financing. There is crowd funding on the Internet, whereby people can lend their own money to small local enterprises. In the United Kingdom up to €90 million has been lent in this way, with a default rate of only 1%. In Ireland €175,000 has been raised thus far, for only five businesses. There are 1,250 registered lenders willing to lend their own money to small local businesses. Does the Minister support that kind of initiative? How can we encourage that sector to grow?

A majority of SMEs are still desperately struggling with this problem and the Minister does not seem to have been able to target them. At the end of the day, the disastrous fiscal austerity programme of this Government is a key factor. Levels of demand are depressed. One only has to visit retailers in the jewellery and grocery sectors, and other retail developments, to see that demand is totally depressed after five and a half years of the macroeconomic madness in which we have been engaged. What is the Minister's Department doing in this area? The overall macroeconomic policy is damning in terms of demand.

It is extremely prohibitive. Yesterday representatives of the national organisation for newsagents came before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It indicated that while some Government systems were in place prices were too high. Banks are not passing on cuts in interest rates to home owners or business people. That has a significant dampening effect on people drawing down credit and puts those with credit in existence under enormous pressure. This body should act as an interface between businesses and the banks to ensure we get a lower charge for credit. Indeed, if one compares us with the likes of Germany one would find credit costs half the price it does here.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	352	There are many questions. On Deputy Murphy's point, we support crowd funding. It is one issue which is being examined in the course of this year by the group I established. My Department and the Department of Finance are involved in it. It offers potential. I accept the point made by Deputy Calleary that there is a delay in getting approvals. It is monitored by RedC, formerly Mazars. I hope to see improvement in that. The banks are being made aware of the dissatisfaction that they are not meeting the turnaround targets.  The ESRI was far from damning in its approach. It recognised that there was a problem with access to finance, as was inevitable following the sort of bank collapse that had occurred in this State. We have also received substantial praise for the range of instruments we have brought in. This week the OECD visited Ireland. We have micro-finance, loan guarantees and the SME fund. These are entirely new instruments for the State and innovative approaches by the Government to meet access to finance. We would like to see them rolled out more quickly, but we can still point to at least 400 jobs that are in place today that would not have been if we did not have micro-finance and credit guarantee schemes.  The other schemes involve development capital and seed funding, and are absolutely crucial if we are to see Irish companies start up, develop and go to scale. They are innovative and have never been tried in the country before. The Deputy needs to allow some time for them to work. I share his impatience, but they are innovative. Far from the rant he had about Government strategy, these are the sort of smart innovations that we need in an economy like ours. The Deputy, above all, should know that we inherited an economy heading for 120% debt, with the huge hole in its public finances. We are providing a jobs strategy which is credible because it takes into account the fact that we need sustainable public finances. If one does not have sustainable public finances one will not be able to build sustainable enterprises. These two approaches have to go in tandem. The stimulus funds, SME finance and using global sourcing of €500 million are all innovative approaches to resolve our huge crisis.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	353	I am aware of the issues surrounding this dispute since I became Minister and, indeed, before that time. I understand that initially attempts were made to resolve the matter by arbitration through the offices of the Labour Relations Commission; however, no constructive developments came out of these efforts despite the LRC remaining at the parties' disposal should it be again required. The workers involved referred some complaints to the rights commissioner service and others directly to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT. Awards were made in their favour by both parties. The rights commissioner awards were appealed to the EAT. I understand that the appeal taken by the company concerning the worker that made the representations, which are the subject of this question, had his appeal heard last February. The company did not attend the appeal, and so it failed for want of prosecution. Under the current system the enforcement of EAT awards is eventually a matter for the courts and civil enforcement process. The holder of an award or his or her trade union may seek to enforce it himself or herself through the Circuit Court or he or she may seek, in most cases, the assistance of the Minister to have this process carried out on his or her behalf. This involves the use of the enforcement services unit of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, to have such awards enforced if appropriate through the civil courts. NERA is currently enforcing some of the awards in question and has engaged legal assistance to further this matter. It is acknowledged that the system that has developed over the years, as illustrated in this case, has become complex and, in some cases, involves unacceptably long delays. However, I have commenced a root and branch reform with the objective of establishing a world-class workplace relations service. It is through the reform of the existing workplace relations structures that we can remove any advantage currently present in delaying a case through appealing and then not taking part in the hearing. As Minister, I propose to establish a new two-tier workplace relations structure with the result that two statutory independent bodies will replace the current five bodies. There will be a new single body of first instance, the workplace relations commission, and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. It is intended that the WRC will deal with all first instance claims within three months from the time the case is lodged. 
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I also believe that for a workplace relations system to have credibility it must be supported by proportionate, effective and efficient compliance and enforcement measures. The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome and expensive and not fit for purpose. For this reason, I am proposing to make provision in the workplace relations Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of compliance notices, fixed charge notices and a new mechanism for forcing awards of the WRC adjudicators and labour court determinations. These measures will provide for more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law. 
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	354	I thank the Minister for his reply. It is more than three years since four workers were unfairly dismissed and left without redundancy or wages owed to them by Connolly Shoes in Dún Laoghaire, a firm which they had worked for, in some cases, over 30 years. They were dumped on the scrap heap by an unscrupulous employer. The LRC and the EAT, as the Minister said, have found on every occasion, based on the issues that have been brought before them, that the workers were right and the employer was wrong. Yet, three and a half years on, John Mulpeter, who has written to the Minister several times, is still picketing outside the premises. The former director or CEO of Connolly Shoes has set up another shoe business under another name and is still operating, with other employees having replaced those who were unfairly dismissed and forced to picket for the past three years. How can it possibly take so long for workers such as those in Connolly Shoes to get justice? Can we have the Minister's assurance that whatever new regime he is considering setting up will prevent this unacceptable situation happening again, and prevent unscrupulous employers treating workers like this and being able to set up the same business under another guise and carry on with impunity? I note the power of the parliamentary question. John Mulpeter has written to the Minister on several occasions looking for answers and miraculously received a letter yesterday, for which I am sure he is very grateful. He should not have to resort to asking a parliamentary question in order to have a letter answered.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	355	As I said in the reply, the existing system I inherited is not fit for purpose and have I set about seeking to reform it.We have already introduced a large number of administrative reforms which are already having an impact. For example, we are seeing a turnaround in respect of access to rights commissioner services. Once the time lapse of notification ends, a hearing will generally be scheduled almost immediately. We are also working on new legislation, which I hope will be published before the end of this session, to overhaul the existing system by way of much improved provisions. For instance, we are changing the provision in regard to appeals to ensure they are fast-tracked. An additional provision in this regard will mean that individuals who do not turn up to a hearing and who subsequently lodge an appeal will be subject to additional charges. We recognise that there are problems with the enforcement regime. We are seeking to reform the regime via the introduction of a determination order for which a worker can apply. On foot of such an order, the Labour Court can enforce its provisions by way of civil proceedings, with a criminal prosecution or both. In short, we are making substantial changes in the system. Unfortunately, however, legislative change takes time. We have had a great deal of consultation and have discussed the proposals at the Oireachtas committee. I recognise that the system needs to be changed and we are already setting about that task.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	356	I welcome the information the Minister has given and his commitment to dealing with these issues. They are applicable not only to the workers at Connolly Footwear, but also those at La Senza, Vita Cortex, Jane Norman and many others. I hope the Minister can prove in the measures he proposes to take that we have a machinery that is capable of delivering justice for workers who are unfairly treated. Looking at the experience of the past two years, one might conclude that the most effective way for workers to obtain justice in these matters is to occupy their place of employment. That seems to be the only means of fast-tracking a fair resolution in these cases. People should not have to do that, just as they should not have to wait three years for a conclusion. I am sure the Connolly Footwear workers are awaiting a verdict with bated breath. Given the duration of this particular case, I hope the Minister will keep an eye on proceedings. He must ensure for the future that there is proper enforcement and compliance in such cases. The measures he is proposing must deliver a system that works in an efficient and timely manner and delivers compliance when employers are found to have behaved wrongly towards their workers.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	357	The National Employment Rights Authority has a role in terms of enforcement. As I said, I hope to bring legislation to the House before the summer. Already the changes we have made are showing a significant improvement, such as having a single point of entry, not having multiple hearings of the same source of dispute, having quick resolution as an alternative and scheduling hearings quickly. I acknowledge, however, that the legislative framework must also be improved.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	358	The credit guarantee scheme is an initiative that was called for by entrepreneurs, business people and their representative bodies for several years. Despite commitments to deliver such a scheme, previous Administrations failed to do so. Upon taking office I sought and received Government support to design from scratch a new scheme which was successfully launched on 24 October last year. As at 10 May, 36 live CGS facilities have been put in place, resulting in €3,661,100 being sanctioned through the scheme by participating lenders. It is expected that 190 new jobs will be created and 115 maintained under these facilities. This is lending and job creation that otherwise would not have happened  The scheme does not involve the taxpayer replacing the banks in providing lending directly to business. It is aimed, rather, at filling a gap in the market for bank lending to particular types of businesses with a shortage of collateral, or in innovative sectors that the banks may not be familiar with, by shifting a proportion of the risk to the State and thereby incentivising the banks to lend. In designing the scheme, a balance was struck between exposing the taxpayer to excessive risk on the one hand and, on the other, ensuring a proper incentive for lending to businesses. The scheme was designed in accordance with international best practice.  The Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, and I promote the scheme at every available opportunity, locally, regionally and nationally, as appropriate. In addition, a direct link to information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website homepage, http://www.enterprise.gov.ie/. Quarterly progress reports are also published on the website. The latest progress report, detailing the analysis and performance of the CGS for the quarterly period ending 31 March 2013, is now available.  The scheme is designed to facilitate up to €150 million of additional lending to eligible SMEs per annum. It is demand-led and the uptake may be lower than €150 million in any given year, depending on company needs. Take-up of the scheme is being closely monitored by its operator, Capita, and my Department. I committed to review it after 12 months of operation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	359	When he launched this very welcome initiative, the Minister referred to the creation of 1,300 jobs for each €150 million of additional funding under the scheme. He knows my own interest in this matter from my involvement in projects in Coolock and elsewhere on the northside over many years. Does he agree that the outturn thus far has been somewhat disappointing? The first Capita report was limited in the insight it offered because it only covered a few months of operation of the scheme. The second, however, is more comprehensive and it shows only 24 facilities in place and a total funding allocation of €3.1 million. The Minister said he has promoted the scheme very widely throughout the country. Is it possible that some small and medium-sized enterprises are still not aware of the scheme? The ESRI commentary, despite what the Minister says, certainly points to a problematic situation for firms seeking to obtain credit. Has he considered extending it to any other institutions? I heard the Minister speaking about multinationals this morning on "Today with Pat Kenny". Is it an objective of the Department to begin planning for a situation where there is a greater reliance on SMEs and where our own indigenous industry is given priority?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21983	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	360	Taking the last question first, the Government is absolutely committed to SMEs, responsibility for which belongs to the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry. Under the Horizon 2020 framework, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, is responsible, we are upping the target this year to 20%. We recognise that the future for Ireland is in developing an indigenous enterprise culture and a robust innovative capacity. Much of our work under the action plan for jobs initiatives has been about easing the pressures facing small indigenous business through the provision, for example, of access to finance, supports for companies and innovation, the move to trade online and other types of opportunities which allow businesses to thrive in a very challenging environment. It is important to emphasise that this is not an either-or situation. It is not a question of saying we do not want foreign investment. Such investment is essential, but we also want to build strong clusters which comprise both international firms and vibrant indigenous businesses. That is the objective and we are working to ensure it happens. I would like to develop the credit guarantee scheme further. It is important to bear in mind that it operates at the point of sale, that is, it is administered through the banks. There is an issue of getting that message across so that more people who are refused funding will consider it and more bankers will consider it as an option for their clients. We are working with the banks to deliver that more effectively on the ground. We are also preparing a review of the scheme. Like the micro-finance fund and the development capital scheme, it is a new initiative which will require tweaking as we go along. We are committed to introducing innovative funding mechanisms. The bottom line is that the retreat of banking from risk-taking will not end today or tomorrow. It is happening throughout Europe, not just in programme countries like Ireland. In that context, there is a requirement to develop new instruments.

I acknowledge his intervention with the subsidised transport scheme which has helped farmers in very difficult situations.  In the short time available I will set out the context for my county and the north-west region in general. Farmers have been working daily on this issue in the hope and expectation that the weather will improve. Last Saturday's rainfall, however, has effectively set farmers' plans back by approximately two weeks. Intertwined with this, the first cut of silage is behind by approximately one month, giving a figure of six weeks in total. This has put farmers in a very difficult position. There are farmers who, through their own resources, are getting meal, hay and silage from neighbouring farmers, but others are in a very difficult position. I have spoken to the Minister about farmers who have organised private transport to get fodder because the co-op does not have it. How can we help these farmers? The stakeholders such as farmers' organisations and Teagasc need to draw up a plan for the next 12 months. I would include a more constructive engagement with our UK counterparts in that plan. With this in mind, I wrote formally this morning to the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr. Owen Paterson, MP, to discuss how we could engage further with his Department and the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and the Crown dependencies to plan a strategy for the next 12 months. The problem does not apply simply to the here and now which is the difficulty for most farmers but will continue to the end of the year. With less silage being cut owing to the deplorable weather conditions, this difficulty will continue in the next nine to 12 months.

The three Deputies who have raised the issue today come from west of the River Shannon. That indicates how bad things are. I come from a farming background and have never seen such a drastic situation. When the weather broke last Tuesday and again at the weekend, it put things back significantly, with the effect that there is a shortage of fodder. I consider it to be a fodder famine. Dependence on hay from England and France has proved difficult. Having spoken to farming organisations, particularly in the marginal areas, I do not believe it will stop now. This will carry on over the winter and into next year; therefore, we need some contingency plans in place to deal with it. Will the Minister consider setting up a subgroup involving all of the interested groups in order that they can come up with strategies to prevent what we are going through? Will the Minister consider opening up ports? In my county farmers are trying to bring in up to 5,000 bales of fodder by boat from France. If that was possible, it would alleviate the problem in the south-west corner temporarily. The Minister needs to remember that there is no cut of silage yet. The only silage cut down my way has been taken straight into the shed because farmers cannot put their cattle out and there is no possibility of proceeding with the main cut, which is the first one. People who used to make two and three cuts a year will be very lucky if they make two this year. On marginal land they will not get this. I would like the Minister to consider setting up a sub-group, as well as opening the ports for farm groups to bring in fodder.

The Minister must redouble efforts to bring urgently needed hay into the country, not only to deal with the immediate shortage but also to make provision for continuing poor weather over the summer. In my part of the country there are three to four farmers for every single bale that comes west of the Shannon. The Minister must immediately release an interim payment under the disadvantaged areas scheme to allow farmers to access money to purchase fertiliser and get it out on land as soon as possible. May and June are vital months for getting the volumes of grass required for winter forage. Farmers have already spent their fertiliser money on buying additional fodder. Every possible effort must also be made to export store animals. Marts around the country cannot shift light store animals because farmers do not have the fodder to buy them and farmers selling stock do not have the fodder to keep them and bring them home. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc must undertake a full audit of stocking rates on farms and ensure assistance is provided directly for farmers who may not have adequate potential fodder supplies to maintain stocking rates in the long term. Additional support must be provided for farmers who have already availed of departmental support on animal welfare grounds. All farmers must complete a basic fodder management plan in conjunction with Teagasc to assess the requirements for and capacity to harvest forage for next winter. If these steps are not taken, we will face a further fodder crisis in the autumn which will require direct financial support, something which will have serious implications for the Exchequer. Everyone within the agriculture sector must pull together to get through the current weather and fodder crisis and ensure all efforts are made to protect individual farmers in the coming months who may face additional challenges owing to the levels of stock on farms.

This is a genuine crisis that has hit many farms, depending on the part of the country affected, the soil depth and weather, particularly in the past two weeks. This is a problem that we need to solve collectively. My Department is at the heart of that process, working with co-ops, Teagasc, private advisers, farm organisations and farmers. On 24 April we introduced a transport subsidy to try to encourage those who had the logistical know-how to bring in large volumes of hay from the United Kingdom and make it available to farmers at a normal price. We covered the cost of the transport. We have twice extended the deadline for the scheme and doubled the fund available. It may well be the case that we will have spent more than €2 million on the scheme by the time it is closed. So far, we have a total of 2,158 loads committed, 419 of which have yet to be delivered. That is over 40,000 tonnes of fodder, enough to feed approximately 5 million to 6 million animals. What has happened in the past three to four weeks has been logistically an extraordinary effort to bring in very large volumes of feed from the United Kingdom and France and now the Netherlands. Deputy Denis Naughten has raised the issue of bringing in a ship. Dairygold is considering bringing in a ship from the Netherlands next week to bring in enough volume and then take it to whatever part of the country most needs it. This is not a matter of providing more for the south, the west or the midlands. We need to get it to whatever area needs it. Everybody needs to work together and is doing so to try to assist in that process with transport. The head of the Irish Road Haulage Association has been very helpful in co-ordinating the effort to bring in fleets of trucks with fodder.It is extraordinary that Ireland is importing grass, but that is the situation. We will continue to do that as long as is necessary. We are ending the fodder scheme officially this Friday but we are allowing until next Friday for importation. The reason I am doing this is that I do not want to keep extending the scheme through the summer, leading to a drip-feed of fodder week after week. I want to put the pressure and the onus on marts, co-ops and others importing hay, and other forms of fodder like maize, to bring in as much as they can over the next ten days to kill this issue once and for all. This will allow farmers get fodder into storage, as well as dealing with emergency access to fodder, so they can concentrate on grazing and managing silage cuts throughout the summer. Certain wet parts of the country are four to six weeks behind in grass production. In other parts of the country, it is just two to three weeks. Much silage is being cut this week in some parts while none in others, as Deputy Martin Ferris pointed out. There is no reason any animal in the country should starve. If a farmer is in the extreme situation where he cannot feed his animals for whatever reason, whether it is because he cannot access fodder or because he cannot afford it, he should contact my Department and we will feed the animals. We have had over 800 calls in the past several weeks, of which 300 were significant welfare cases in which we intervened. So far, we have spent over €130,000 actually getting hay into farmyards to feed animals. We will continue to do that as is necessary and there is no ceiling to that fund as it is an animal welfare issue. We will work on a confidential basis with farmers to help them get over this period. This is not linked to inspections or enforcements. It is purely an animal welfare helpline. This year we will have to extend the grazing and grass-growing season, if the weather allows. With this in mind, I, along with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, earlier announced a temporary and targeted adjustment to two provisions of the nitrates regulations to support additional fodder production on farms in the coming months. Essentially, we will extend the period for the spreading of chemical fertilisers to the end of September rather than the middle of the month. It also deals with the phosphorous issue which is now a problem as many farmers have fed their animals with more concentrates than normally which has knock-on consequences for the nitrates directive and action plan. Teagasc is in overdrive to advise farmers and help them put new fodder management plans in place to which Deputy Naughten referred. This will continue throughout the summer. We will also put in place a strategic advisory expert group which will remain in place right through next winter. It will be assessing the audits that we have to do on the availability of fodder and other strategic measures that need to be taken to ensure we can feed animals through next winter. There is much preparation under way for the medium to long-term problem with fodder supply. It is not all about the crisis, although ensuring all animals are fed is what is most important.

The message has to go out that there has to be a management plan over the next 12 months. While the narrative is often that farmers have it good with good prices for cattle and milk, the real story behind farming is that its costs have gone up in the past two years. Accordingly, we must consider the potential income for farmers over the next 12 to 18 months. Farmers, both small and large, have been hit badly. The introduction of a means test for the farm assist scheme was a big blow to farmers. It is a dependency social payment and removing this means test should be considered in the next budget. Access to the payment would assist those farmers under severe financial constraints who had to spend more on fodder this year. The moneys they would get under the scheme will ultimately go back into the local economy.

Can he revisit that, as it is my understanding that the fund was previously used to assist Austrian farmers who faced a fodder crisis ten years ago? The weather broke at the end of May last year and has not settled since. This is the problem farmers are facing. Unless they can get some sort of silage harvest this year, then there will be serious problems down the road. Every effort must be made to assist them. I welcome the Minister’s announcement he is extending the time for the spreading of fertiliser under the nitrates regulations. It will help in some way but provisions need to be put in place to ensure adequate fodder can be got in on the understanding that we are heading into a winter with little fodder saved this year with the same likelihood in early next year. I welcome the Minister putting in place a strategic management plan in this regard.

Will the Minister examine the export of store animals out of the country? I understand there are licence applications for such exports before the Department. Will he ensure these are expedited and processed? There is now a problem that agricultural merchants and many of the co-ops have extended credit to farmers to such an extent that they cannot extend it any further and remain viable. Will the Minister examine some mechanism to release part of the disadvantaged areas scheme payment, DAS? I know he cannot make the full payment until all inspections are completed. However, will he look at an interim payment that would allow farmers to purchase fertiliser? In my part of the country where the weather is improving, farmers do not have the money or the access to credit to buy fertiliser. Unless, fertiliser is spread over the next fortnight, we are looking at a very serious animal welfare issue and viability issues for the agricultural sector this autumn.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	368	DAS is never paid before the end of September. There is a reason for that. Legally, one cannot make a payment until one can prove that a farmer qualifies for it. One of the qualification criteria is that the farmer has to have had his animals for seven months. We are not even seven months into the year. I am being asked to give out payments to farmers before they even qualify. If I did that, the Commission would introduce a disallowance, meaning we would not get further payments later on in the year. DAS is a slightly different category to single farm payments because it is a matching fund, as half of it comes from the Exchequer. Naturally, one would assume we could pay that part of the DAS payment now and worry about the rest later. That is not how it works. There are strict rules under which one can make payments. In order to make a payment legally, one must ensure the farmer qualifies and make the necessary inspections to ensure he is compliant. If I start making payments early without those checks in place, when the Commission audits us, it will point out that we made payments inappropriately and we will get disallowances. In the UK disallowances have been in the hundreds of millions of euro while Denmark’s disallowances came to €110 million. Last year, Ireland’s disallowances came to less than €2 million out of €1.2 billion in payments.That is how compliant we are. Deputy Naughten is correct that if farmers are not spreading fertiliser because they cannot afford to buy it due to lack of credit, that is a mad situation and we need to address it through the banking system and the credit available from co-operatives and merchants. We need to find a way to do that but that is why we have a banking system. If farmers know they will receive a cheque containing a DAS payment at the end of September and a cheque in the middle of October under the single payment scheme, they should be able to use the banking system, which should give them competitive credit rates during that period. Banks have told me they are happy to make credit available to farmers with no repayments required until the scheme payments come through in the autumn. We should be able to put that facility in place. My Department is not a bank and we would get ourselves into difficulty if we tried to advance payments without putting the necessary structures in place. I will put in writing the reason we cannot access the solidarity fund for Deputy Ferris. I have pushed hard on that issue to try to get something out of it and it just has not been possible. I take the point made by Deputy McHugh. Management plans are needed at national level and at individual farm level to prepare for next winter and we have to put them in place over the summer.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	I feel a little inadequate raising an issue of this nature in the immediate aftermath of a discussion on a fodder crisis and animal welfare. However, I agree with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that heritage and cultural issues need to be at the heart of the national recovery we are working towards. Perhaps on that basis I should not feel so unhappy about raising the issue of the Croppies' Acre. It is a well known site in central Dublin close to the National Museum at Collins Barracks, Heuston Station and a Luas stop. In 2011, significant moneys were expended by the Office for Public Works, OPW, renovating the site. There was controversy when it was proposed that the site be developed as a bus and car park for the National Museum, which would have been a travesty. At the time, between €35,000 and €40,000 of public money was expended on developing and preserving this unique site, which houses the burial place of many members of the 1798 Rebellion. Matthew Tone and Bartholomew Teeling - I do not know if he is related to the owner of the Teeling Whiskey Company - are reputed to be buried there. The grounds have been misused by a tiny section of the public. Syringes and other drugs paraphernalia have been found there and anti-social behaviour is an issue. People are climbing over the walls to enter the grounds to drink and it is no longer open to the public as a result. This national monument has been closed by OPW officials because they do not have available to them the small amount required to keep this site clean in order that it can be safely accessed by the public. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who is standing in for the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Can priority be given to dealing with this relatively minor issue in order that the site can be reopened to Dubliners and the people of the country as a whole? It is an issue that is well capable of being solved by the Government.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	This issue falls exclusively under the remit of the OPW and the Deputy should not feel the need to apologise for raising this matter. It is an important issue, not least because of the historical connection but also because of its location. The site is on a major thoroughfare running alongside the River Liffey into town. Hundreds of thousands of cars pass the area every year. It is also close to the National Museum at Collins Barracks and, therefore, it is an important tourist location. The Deputy is correct to raise the issue and to put the OPW and myself under as much pressure as he can to resolve it. He should make no apologies whatsoever for that. The area known as Croppies' Acre lies between the National Museum at Collins Barracks and the River Liffey. It is enclosed by walls and has access gates. The area is managed by the Commissioners of Public Works, whose staff maintain the grounds, cut grass, etc. Croppies' Acre has been susceptible to anti-social behaviour for some time. The walls are easily scaled in certain parts and the grounds are frequented by drug users, junkies and people abusing alcohol generally during the hours of darkness and especially at weekends. The grounds had been opened to the general public by the OPW, usually between 9.30 a.m. and 5.00 p.m., Monday to Saturday, in line with the opening hours of the nearby National Museum. However, it was becoming increasingly common for the OPW to discover used syringes among other rubbish discarded on the preceding night. In consequence, a decision was taken in May 2011 to close the area to the public on health and safety grounds. Sufficient resources are not available to the OPW to sterilise the entire area every day before opening the gates and inviting the public to enter and the commissioners, reasonably, were not prepared to accept the risk of, say, a child picking up a discarded needle with potentially disastrous consequences for his or her health. It was with reluctance that the commissioners decided to close Croppies' Acre, and they have been exploring ways of reopening this small park for some time. Discussions are ongoing with Dublin City Council in this regard and I am hopeful that the park can be reopened to the public in the not too distant future under the management of the council. I would like to correct recent media reports which stated that the Croppies' Acre park contained the Anna Livia fountain and sculpture originally located on O'Connell Street. This monument is sited in an area nearby but outside the Croppies' Acre grounds and it is not under the management or control of the Commissioners of Public Works. The monument is still accessible to the public. It is my intention and that of the OPW and Dublin City Council to see if we can reopen this small park as soon as possible. Logically, its management should lie with the city council and we are having discussions with its officials. I hope the fact that the Deputy has put the issue on the agenda of the House will ensure that a common-sense solution can be found between the OPW and the council. I look forward to that meeting shortly.

Dubliners will be delighted to be reminded that the Floozie in the Jacuzzi is located outside the Ashling Hotel rather than in the Croppies' Acre. There was concern in the past that this small park would form part of the National Museum complex and be integrated into that, but the Government and the OPW have decided to go down the road of discussions with the city council, which I accept. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is sitting beside the Minister of State, will be well used to councils throughout the country telling him that they are strapped for cash and have great difficulty funding their current operations without taking on board additional responsibilities. What sort of assurances can the Minister of State give us that there is a likelihood that Dublin City Council will take responsibility for this site and clean up the appalling mess? I agree with him that it is completely unacceptable that hypodermic syringes and needles and so on need to be removed from this site on a regular basis. We would all appeal to those people who are irresponsible users of this particular facility not to be but given that they are, what sort of assurances can the Minister of State give us that the funding will be available to Dublin City Council to get on with the job and to take this on board?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	372	We are looking at this issue very closely. As I said, I hope it will be resolved in the not too distant future and that we can work up some flexible arrangement with Dublin City Council. We are in the parks business in the context of our own properties, such as Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green, and the many other national historic properties which fall under the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. We are not really in the business of neighbourhood parks or parks which are, generally speaking, not attached to national historic properties or national monuments. Given the proximity of this very important historic site to the National Museum, we must work up a solution. The Deputy put his finger on it when he said that this was an important historic site which is right beside the museum and that it is also important for tourists as a kind of overspill area. However, people need to feel some semblance of safety walking around it during the day or in the early evening, in particular over the summer. I hope we can work up a flexible arrangement with the city council to resolve this issue. I have given a commitment that it will be in the not too distant future and the Deputy can hold me to that.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	373	I thank the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, for being present to discuss this very important and pressing issue which has now become an issue of public health and safety in County Wicklow. What started off nearly three months ago with a small number of houses in Kilpedder not being able to access a regular supply of water has now extended to literally thousands of people in County Wicklow being unable to access a water supply. Local media reports today have said there will not be a regular supply of water available to these homes for months or even into the foreseeable future. There is a complete confusion and lack of clarity as to what the problem is, not to mention there being any solution to it. It seems Dublin City Council is responsible for this water supply. I am worried that it is showing less concern for the people of Wicklow than it might for the people of Dublin if they were affected. Cancer patients are living in houses without a water supply and people with babies have had no water for 14 days. This cannot continue. It is affecting people in Kilmacanogue, Kilpedder, Enniskerry, Newcastle and Delgany. While I would not normally raise an issue such as this in the Dáil, because it is a matter for the local authorities to resolve in the first instance, considering that it has not been resolved at local authority level, it is important the Minister asks his Department to intervene, to bang heads together, to tell us the truth about the problem as there seems to be much rumour and speculation and, most important, to put in place a solution and demand that Dublin City Council meets Wicklow County Council to find a solution and to give a timeframe for it.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	I thank the Minister for attending the House for this important issue which has been going on since St. Patrick's Day and which concerns the Roundwood reservoir where there is algae growth over the filter beds which means a sufficient amount of water is not getting through. I have spoken to several senior engineers who have said there is enough water in the reservoir - we all know that because we have been rained on for the past number of months - but that it is not getting through the filter beds. I understand Dublin City Council is looking at this. However, it originally told Wicklow County Council that the issue would be resolved by the end of May but it recently came back and said it would be the end of June at the earliest. The indication I have from officials in Wicklow County Council is that it could go on for several months.  Two nights ago, the water supply in Enniskerry was shut off at 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. the following day. This will continue seven days per week for the foreseeable future. Willow Grove, Delgany and various areas in north Wicklow are being hit. My concern is that, as the water stocks fall and the block in the filters remains, this situation will not only not be fixed but could actually become much worse. Such a concern was expressed to me by a senior engineer in Wicklow County Council two days ago.  I have two specific requests. The first is that the Minister ask his officials to liaise with Dublin City Council to ensure that its engineers have all the resources they need to resolve this. It may be the case that this simply will take a very long time and that it is very complex but I would like to know that the council is not wanting in terms of technology, staff or other resources in order to get this solved very quickly. Second, will somebody look at the locations being cut off? I would be concerned if areas in Wicklow were being cut off by Dublin City Council but that areas in Dublin were not. It might be easier - I am not saying it is - for Dublin City Council to turn off Enniskerry rather than Stillorgan, for example.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	375	I apologise to the Deputies for my delay in arriving in the House and for not being here for the appropriate slot but I thank them for raising this important issue. It would be useful to clarify the role of both the Department and the water services authorities in the provision of water services. The Department does not have responsibility for, or any role in, the management, maintenance or operation of water infrastructure. As the Deputies know, it is a matter in the first instance for the relevant water services authorities, in this case Wicklow County Council and-or Dublin City Council, which are responsible under statute, for the operation, maintenance and management of water infrastructure, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. The primary role of the Department is to support those water services authorities in providing the necessary water infrastructure and this is done through the Department's water services investment programme. I assure the Deputies I will ensure the personnel on the engineering side are in constant contact with the Wicklow and Dublin city authorities to ensure this matter is resolved sooner rather than later.  Water supplies in the greater Dublin area, including north Wicklow, are generally provided on a shared basis under agreements drawn up between the relevant water services authorities under powers available to those authorities in the Water Services Acts and which are exercised under arrangements entered into without reference to me as the Minister. However, from inquiries made to Wicklow County Council, I am advised that there is an ongoing issue with the water supplied from Dublin City Council's Vartry reservoir, as indicated by the Deputies. Apparently, due to algae problems at Vartry, the capacity and output from the reservoir has been reduced by 50%. I am informed that Kilpedder, Glen of the Downs, Kilmacanogue and surrounding areas are fed directly from the Vartry reservoir and that with the drop in pressure of the water being supplied from the reservoir, householders are experiencing a reduced water supply and, in some instances, no water supply at all.  I understand that Wicklow County Council is providing consumers with water by locating water tankers throughout the affected areas, including locations such as Foxes Meadow, Bellevue Hill in Kilpedder, Jameson’s Corner in Delgany and Kilmacanogue. In addition, Dublin City Council has crews working on the problem at the Vartry reservoir on a full-time basis, with a view to increasing the output from Vartry and reducing the need for tankering of water. I also understand that consumers in Enniskerry, as was mentioned, and the surrounding areas have been advised of interruptions to supply, mainly overnight, in order to ensure that the supply in the reservoir is replenished for distribution during the day. That is not acceptable and it is something which could have been better planned. To date, the Department's water services investment programme 2010-13, water supply and watermain rehabilitation contracts, costing in excess of €16 million, have been completed in County Wicklow. Contracts for further water supply improvements and mains rehabilitation, costing in the region of €25 million, are being planned and I will check at what stage they are in regard to rolling out this programme. Additional substantial works are proposed to improve the water supply from Vartry and Dublin City Council is advancing the planning of these works. I understand the difficulties being experienced by consumers at the lack of a continuous supply of water in their areas; it is unacceptable and it demonstrates once again the need for reform in this area. As Deputies know, we have a very ambitious water reform programme but in the immediate and short term, we want to see consumers are able to enjoy the supply of water from their local water services authority as quickly as possible. I will undertake to do whatever I can to expedite this work.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	376	I thank the Minister for his answer. I know he does not have direct responsibility for these services and neither does this House. We have a moral responsibility at this stage. While I appreciate the answer the Minister has given, I suggest the information he has been given by officials in the council or his Department underestimates the seriousness of the issue. Thousands of people in County Wicklow do not have a trickle of water. Some of my constituents have not been able to have a shower in their house for two, three or four weeks. I accept that water has been supplied from tankers. However, mothers and fathers have been told to walk down hills to these tankers to get water for their babies. Cancer patients who are terminally ill are dealing with this issue in their homes. I understand this is nobody's specific problem. I do not think the requisite degree of urgency is being applied to it, particularly by Dublin City Council which has been extremely evasive in its provision of information for Wicklow County Council. This frustration is shared by many of the staff of Wicklow County Council. The only change in the press releases issued by the council in recent days has been the addition of estates and roads. I ask the Minister to examine whether there can be any redistribution of the existing water supply. We do not want to deprive the constituents of Deputies in south Dublin like the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, of water. However, there may be additional supplies in parts of south Dublin. Perhaps water pressure might be reduced in some areas to make water available for redistribution in others. That would allow everyone to have some water. It would be a much more humane way of dealing with the problem.

I appreciate that he understands the urgency of the matter and I am pleased he will look into it. I will make a quick comment before asking two follow-up questions. The night-time refilling of water tankers, mentioned by the Minister, is becoming less frequent. The water tanks in areas not getting any water during the day were filling up at night. At least, those residents had some water for sanitation, etc., during the day. Since last Friday, however, that has stopped happening every night. As a result of the failure of the water tanks to refill at night, some houses are not getting water for several days at a time. I wanted to let the Minister know about this. While it is great that water tankers have been made available, it has been pointed out to me that more could be done. Some of those who have to walk long distances to get water to bring back to their houses have impaired mobility. Can a means of distributing water other than by water tankers be found to make the interim problem a little less difficult? I do not know whether that is possible. I seek confirmation of an aspect of the Minister's response that I did not understand. Did he say work was not taking place to deal with the algae problem? Did he say that work was planned in that regard? Is it the case that work on the problem is ongoing as a matter of urgency and that additional work is being planned?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	378	I will deal with the last point first. Work is being done on the algae problem. I assure the Deputies that I will ask the local authorities and the officials in my Department to give this matter the sense of urgency it deserves, in line with the information they have given to the House. I acknowledge the difficulties that people and consumers are experiencing. It is unacceptable in this modern age that we have such difficulties. It demonstrates the fragility of our natural resources and the importance of water. It is unacceptable in this modern day that so many people waste so much water. It is a finite resource, as demonstrated by the problems we are having in counties Wicklow and Dublin. I will speak to the officials at the end of this debate to ensure there is a sense of urgency in this regard and these problems will be remedied on a temporary and a permanent basis as soon as possible.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	379	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, for taking this Topical Issue. It is always good when someone with direct responsibility for an issue comes into the House to face the music.  When the centralisation of medical card applications was announced, the HSE and the Government promised that it would result in a more streamlined, efficient and, ultimately, compassionate system, in which people's needs would be responded to quickly, directly and compassionately. It is clear, however, from what I am hearing from my constituents in County Clare that this is simply not happening, unfortunately. I have heard numerous stories of medical cards being withdrawn from children with disabilities who are among the most vulnerable in our society. The parents of these children did not find out about the withdrawal of the medical cards until they went to pharmacies, as they do on a regular basis, to obtain the drugs or pharmaceuticals needed by their children. When they learned that the medical cards were no longer valid, they contacted the centralised unit and were told the matter would be dealt with if they filled in an application form. The people concerned have been treated with very little compassion or understanding of the very difficult situation in which they find themselves. That is certainly not what the Government promised. As someone who regularly goes through the voting lobbies in support of the Government, it is certainly not what I would have expected. I do not intend to take up a very long period. There are some specific questions I would like to have answered. How many medical cards have been withdrawn this year from children with special needs, particularly with autism and cancer? Has any of these medical cards been cancelled without a statutory review being conducted? In other words, have they simply been cancelled on a whim, with people being asked to reapply if they believe they really deserve them? Is there a deliberate policy of cancelling medical cards to save money, before making people reapply and prove they should have had them in the first place? How many medical cards have subsequently been restored on appeal? I appreciate that the Minister of State might not have an answer to that final question. I commend the Minister of State again for coming into the Chamber to deal with this important issue. It is very difficult for families to deal with the severe stress caused by lifelong conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The removal of medical cards from such families adds very much to and compounds the pressures they are facing at a difficult time for everyone in the country.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	380	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Budget 2013 introduced some amendments to the guidelines governing the provision of medical cards and GP visit cards for those under the age of 70 years and those over that age. None of the changes that have been made to the schemes would affect this specific group of children in the manner suggested by the Deputy. No change has been made that would have such an impact. The Deputy has referred to instances of people who have been advised while attending a pharmacy that the medical cards awarded for children with certain conditions have expired and that reapplication is required. That is essentially the issue he has raised. I am surprised and concerned that this situation, as outlined by the Deputy, could arise. I will outline briefly to him and the House the standard and uniform processes required to be applied when medical cards are being renewed. The medical card scheme is operated by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, to which the Deputy referred. Since the medical card scheme was centralised under the PCRS, every medical card shows an expiry date, before which the eligibility of the holder is reassessed by the PCRS. A letter is issued to the medical card holder three months before the expiry date and again one month before that date. The medical card is renewed after the case has been reviewed and eligibility has been confirmed. A medical card will remain valid, regardless of the expiry date shown on it, as long as the medical card holder is genuinely engaging with the PCRS review process. The medical card holder does not need to take any action other than to co-operate in a genuine way with the review process and communicate with the PCRS on an ongoing basis throughout any review that may take place. Eligibility can be confirmed by any doctor or pharmacist through the GP practice or pharmacy IT systems, or by medical card holders at www.medicalcard.ie. While I appreciate that not everybody is online, this facility is available to those who are. A person can continue to receive drugs and GP services while he or she awaits a decision on his or her medical card renewal application simply by using the medical card number. While people with specific illnesses are not automatically entitled to medical cards under the provisions of the relevant legislation, the legislation provides for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account when determining whether there is "undue hardship" - the phrase used in the Act - for a person in providing a health service for himself or herself or his or her dependants. It is important to stress that the medical card system is founded on the "undue hardship" test. The basic infrastructure of the medical card system provides that medical cards are allocated to persons on the basis of their material circumstances rather than on the basis of a particular illness. The discretionary system is an exception to the general rule.However, the general rule is that we allocate medical cards on the basis of material means, which relates to the phrase "undue hardship" in the 1970 Act. I understand the cards referred to by the Deputy are discretionary medical cards. On average, discretionary cards are valid for two to three years and the renewal processes that I outlined earlier also apply for discretionary cards. People should not receive, out of the blue, statements from pharmacists or anybody else to the effect that their medical cards are gone. I am most concerned to hear this is occurring in the manner that has been suggested, and I have no doubt the Deputy is raising the matter on the basis of information he has received. Even for the short-term discretionary cards of six months or one year, they will receive a renewal notice three months in advance of the stated expiry date. In setting review dates and to avoid causing anxiety, the HSE must be and is, so far as I can see, sensitive to the needs and conditions of the individual. The target turnaround time for discretionary medical cards is 20 working days. Having said all of that, if the Deputy has specific cases which he would like to have examined, the PCRS would be happy to do so. If the Deputy needs any assistance in this regard, I will be happy to afford it to him.

As I said, I am a Teachta Dála, and I am bringing the message to the Dáil that this issue has arisen in my constituency. It may well be a localised failure due to a systems failure. I am satisfied with the Minister of State's reply and, if the problem persists, I will take up the matter with the PCRS, as the Minister of State has advised. If that fails, I will bring it back to the Minister of State.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	384	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." The Bill establishes a comprehensive statutory framework for the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework. It is underpinned by a detailed legal assessment of the scope for Oireachtas inquiries on the basis of the outcome of the Abbeylara case. It is very clear from the Supreme Court's judgment and the views it expressed on that case that the Oireachtas is not empowered, in general, to make findings of facts adverse to the good name of any person who is not either a Member of the Houses, or an officeholder or otherwise directly accountable to the Houses. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the Government sought in 2011 to empower the Oireachtas through a change in the Constitution to carry out full inquiries. The outcome of the autumn 2011 referendum was that the electorate endorsed the status quo whereby the scope for an Oireachtas inquiry to make findings that could damage the reputation of an individual was strictly limited. The extensive analysis carried out since the referendum has confirmed that there is broad scope under the Constitution for the Oireachtas to carry out legitimate inquiries into matters of public importance, including where the Oireachtas proposes to examine an issue related to the Oireachtas's fundamental constitutional function to make law. The main caveat to the scope for such Oireachtas inquiries is that the terms of reference of such inquiries cannot focus on the conduct of individuals, rather, they must relate, for example, to the systems, practices, procedures, policies and the implementation of policy, and the effectiveness of legislative and regulatory systems. There is no constraint on such an inquiry making significant findings on these matters and the performance of those bodies responsible for and governed by statutory frameworks laid down by the Oireachtas provided these findings are fully consistent with the evidence adduced before the inquiry committee. Such inquiries could represent a very substantial strengthening in the effectiveness and contribution of the legislature to our democratic system by not only helping us learn vital lessons from past events but, through their recommendations, identifying the legislative reforms and policy changes essential to making sure that egregious policy errors are not repeated. The Bill before us, therefore, represents a very important step in the process of clarifying the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in securing accountability through investigations into matters of significant public importance. The Bill will enhance the effective functioning of our modern parliamentary democracy by facilitating such inquiries. It is our duty as public representatives to use our constitutional powers appropriately and responsibly, and for the benefit of the wider society and the economy. Used effectively, I anticipate that the framework to be established by this Bill will facilitate focused, constructive political discourse that will enhance our parliamentary system. I have long advocated the need for an effective and legally robust parliamentary banking inquiry into the events that occurred on the night of the bank guarantee and the systems failures that led to our current fiscal crisis. This Bill will facilitate such an inquiry provided the terms of reference of the inquiry are correctly framed. However, the proposed legislation does substantially more than facilitate a banking inquiry; the primary purpose of this legislation is to create a comprehensive legal framework which is of general application. A critical consideration guiding the development of the detailed provisions of the Bill is that the Houses themselves, pursuant to Article 15.10 of the Constitution, are afforded significant autonomy to regulate their own affairs. This principle has been respected throughout the Bill, with provisions allowing internal matters pertaining to the Houses to be regulated by rules and Standing Orders, where possible. The Bill envisages a central role for the Houses of the Oireachtas in both initiating and conducting a parliamentary inquiry. Under the Bill, responsibility is assigned exclusively to the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine the requirement for a formal inquiry, the terms of reference of that inquiry, the appropriate committee to conduct the inquiry and the procedural and organisational aspects of the inquiry. It was firmly established by the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case that an inquiry carried out by the Houses of the Oireachtas must strictly conform with fair procedures consistent with the principles of natural justice. The outcome of the autumn 2011 referendum confirmed that fair procedures in respect of the interaction between the Oireachtas and the ordinary citizen were of paramount concern to the people of Ireland. Respect for the rights of the individual is enshrined in this Bill, and there are extensive provisions in regard to fair procedures for all types of inquiries carried out. The Bill will not impede the important and valuable work that is currently being conducted by Oireachtas committees. The Bill fully replicates and restates the powers available to committees under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities) Act 1997, as well as providing for a simplification of the current process of invoking compellability powers. The 1997 Act will be repealed by this Bill. Furthermore, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government relating to civil servants giving evidence to Dáil committees, the Bill makes provisions to expand the scope of evidence that civil servants may give. Civil servants will not be restricted from giving evidence for the purpose of establishing facts and giving the committee the full narrative of some series of events. The current prohibition on the Oireachtas committees from asking a public servant to otherwise express an opinion on the merits of policy will be maintained. It is not expected that disclosing policy-specific policy advice should occur other than in exceptional circumstances where it is central to terms of reference of an inquiry. This will be set out in revised guidance to all civil servants once this legislation is enacted. The programme for Government contained a commitment to address the issue of confidential communications with Members through constitutional change. Following a detailed policy assessment and on the basis of legal analysis, it has now been decided to legislate in regard to this issue. The Bill provides for qualified privilege for confidential communication from members of the public to Members of either House. This will facilitate those who wish to draw wrongdoing to the attention of Members of the Oireachtas without having their identities disclosed. The Bill provides for qualified statutory privilege for private papers of Members and official documents of the Houses. These provisions are intended to apply in all circumstances and are not restricted to inquiries carried out under the Bill. I would now like to turn to the Bill before the House. This Bill, as I have already indicated, establishes a comprehensive statutory framework for the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries, as was recommended in the Abbeylara judgment. I will now go through the Parts of the Bill and give a brief outline of its content.Part 1 of the Bill contains sections 1 to 5, inclusive, and deals with standard preliminary and general matters, including the Title of the Bill and provisions for its commencement.  Part 2 contains sections 6 to 13, inclusive, and details the types of inquiry that may be conducted in accordance with the Bill. Section 6 provides for an inquire, record and report inquiry. This is a power to undertake inquiries by way of recording and reporting evidence and make findings of uncontested facts. Section 7 provides for a power to undertake inquiries and make findings of fact relating to the legislative functions of the Houses. Section 8 provides for a power to undertake inquiries relating to the removal of certain officeholders as provided for in Articles 12.10, 33.4 or 35 of the Constitution or arising from legislation relating to the removal of other judges or officeholders where a resolution of both Houses is required. Section 9 provides for a power to undertake inquiries in respect of the conduct of a Member of either House in his or her capacity as a Member. Section 10 provides for a power to undertake inquiries to hold the current Government to account pursuant to Article 28.4 of the Constitution and also to hold to account any person who is liable to Dáil scrutiny by virtue of the terms of his or her contract or statutory appointment. Section 11 provides for a parliamentary mechanism whereby a proposal by a committee to conduct an inquiry is assessed by the individual or committee designated by the rules and Standing Orders of the House or Houses concerned. Section 12 makes provision for the passing of a resolution by the House or Houses to establish an inquiry and the setting of terms of reference for a Part 2 inquiry. Section 13 outlines the finding of failure to co-operate with a Part 2 inquiry that a committee is entitled to make.  Part 3 contains sections 14 to 29, inclusive, and provides for a range of fair procedures to be followed by an Oireachtas committee conducting an inquiry pursuant to the Bill. As outlined, the requirement to observe fair procedures applies to all Part 2 inquiries conducted under the Bill. I draw Members' attention to the following sections in this part. Section 15 makes it clear that a witness to an inquiry has the same privileges and immunities as a witness giving evidence to the High Court. Section 16 permits the committee designated by the rules and Standing Orders of the House or Houses to issue a wide range of guidelines, consistent with the Bill, relating to the procedures of Part 2 inquiries. Section 18 prohibits a Member of the Houses from sitting on a committee where a perception of bias might arise in a reasonable person.Section 19 provides that a witness to an inquiry has the right to be accompanied by his or her legal practitioner while giving evidence if he or she so desires and attend any public session of the inquiry or the giving of evidence by any witness relevant to him or her. Section 21 outlines the rights of a person whose good name is or may be in issue. These rights include the right to be given advance notice of evidence proposed to be given against him or her in so far as that is possible, the right to cross-examine witnesses, the right to give evidence to the inquiry, the right to call witnesses and the right to make a submission at the close of evidence. Sections 23 to 25, inclusive, provide for a notice to issue of a committee's intention to exercise its compellability powers, set out the standard of proof and its duty to inform witnesses of its powers. Section 26 makes it clear that evidence compiled for the purposes of an inquiry will not be admissible in any other proceedings such as criminal and disciplinary proceedings. Section 28 makes provision for the taking of evidence to be conducted in public and states this evidence may be broadcast to the public, unless the Chairman of the committee is satisfied that it would not be in the interests of the inquiry or fair procedures to do so. Part 4 contains sections 30 to 38, inclusive, and makes provision for interim and final reports of a committee conducting an inquiry. These sections make provision for the form and content of such reports, matters relating to the amendment and publication of reports and the confidentiality of such documents. Part 5 is divided into five chapters and concerns costs. Again, I will highlight the most significant sections in this part. Chapter 1 contains sections 39 to 42, inclusive. Section 40 requires a committee, prior to commencing an inquiry, to prepare a report containing an estimate of the legal costs and expenses expected to be incurred. Section 41 provides for the appointment of a panel of legal costs accountants willing and able to act as a parliamentary legal costs adjudicator in certain circumstances, while section 42 sets out the powers of the adjudicator.  Chapter 2 contains sections 43 to 49, inclusive, and contains provisions relating to Oireachtas inquiry legal costs. The focus in the Bill is on providing for recoupment of legal costs only in the limited cases where the good name of a person is at issue. Section 43 empowers the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to issue guidelines in respect of inquiry legal costs. Section 44 provides for the recoupment of third party costs in specified circumstances. Section 45 provides that where a committee conducting an inquiry, or another person, has incurred additional legal costs as a result of the behaviour of a third party, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission may direct the third party to pay such costs, provided that the grounds for the belief have been confirmed by the High Court.  Chapter 3 contains sections 50 to 52, inclusive, and concerns the payment by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission of inquiry expenses and the power of the commission to issue guidelines and direct third parties to pay expenses in certain circumstances.  Chapter 4 contains sections 54 to 58, inclusive, and makes provision for legal costs in respect of private bills. These provisions allow for the updating of 19th century and early 20th century legislation in respect of private bill costs to bring it into line with the other costs provisions included in the Bill.  Chapter 5 contains sections 59 to 61, inclusive, and contains miscellaneous provisions in respect of costs. Parts 6 and 7 largely mirror and update the provisions of the Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities) Act 1997. Part 6 contains sections 62 to 72, inclusive, and concerns compellability, privileges and immunities and applies only to an Oireachtas committee while it is conducting an inquiry pursuant to the Bill and on which a power to send for persons, papers and records has been conferred by the House. This part outlines the powers of such a committee in obtaining evidence and makes provisions relating to irrelevant and exempt evidence.  Part 7 contains five chapters and concerns compellability, privileges and immunities. This part applies to an Oireachtas committee while it is conducting non-inquiry committee business and on which the power to send for persons, papers and records has been conferred. Chapter 1 contains sections 73 and 74 and relevant definitions in respect of the part. Chapter 2 contains sections 75 to 79, inclusive, and concerns privileges and immunities of witnesses in circumstances where a committee is conducting its ordinary business outside of formal inquiry mode. Chapter 3 contains sections 80 to 87, inclusive, and makes provision for directions that may be given by a committee while it is exercising its compellability powers. Chapter 4 contains section 88 and provides for the payment by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission of the reasonable expenses of a witness in proceedings before a committee. Part 8 contains sections 89 and 90. Section 89 provides that a Member of either House shall not be amenable to any court and authority other than the House by which the relevant committee was appointed in respect of any utterance in or before a committee. It also provides that certain documents may be privileged. Section 90 places restrictions on the evidence of certain persons and contains the reformed procedure in respect of the evidence of civil servants which I outlined. Part 9 contains sections 91 to 100, inclusive, and provides for applications to the High Court in respect of the conduct of an inquiry. Section 91 clearly provides for an application to the High Court for directions in respect of the proceedings of an inquiry where a person is of the opinion that any matter relating to the proceedings is not being inquired into or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the Bill. A committee may apply to the High Court for directions. Section 92 makes provision for such an application when a committee is of the opinion that a report could prejudice criminal proceedings. Section 95 permits a parliamentary legal costs adjudicator to refer a question of law arising in the context of an application for an adjudication of costs for the opinion of the court. Section 96 permits a committee to apply to court where a person fails to comply with a direction of the inquiry.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	385	Fianna Fáil welcomes parliamentary inquiries. The public recognises the value of these inquiries which bring to light important information that otherwise may not be made public. I refer to the recent hearings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children to consider the protection of life during pregnancy Bill. The hearings were very well conducted and have been very informative. They are an example of the good work of committees under the existing regime. Across the water, a House of Commons committee held public hearings last week on various matters while the following day the US congressional hearings were being conducted. Both hearings dealt with the corporation tax rate paid by multinational companies in Ireland. These matters are very relevant to Ireland and were being discussed in other parliaments in other jurisdictions. The public expect that Members of this House should be able to obtain similar information by means of hearing and inquiries. While this is an island we are not isolated and people see these things on television. Many Oireachtas committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, hold public hearings every week. Important information is made public and the good work of the committees is recognised. The Bill was published last Friday. It has a great Title but there is very little that is new or of much substance in this legislation. It is an attempt to give a good impression that much is being done but this is not evident when one delves further. The parliamentary inquiries system in Ireland cannot be a vehicle for attributing individual responsibility. Any attempt to do so would cause the inquiry to collapse and would conflict with the decision of the people in October 2011 by way of referendum. The Government put forward the referendum on a proposed change in the existing constitutional provision. Unfortunately, due to the arrogance of certain Ministers - I do not include Deputy Howlin - the proposal was rejected by the people. I refer to the Minister's opening contribution in which he stated, "The outcome of the autumn 2011 referendum was that the electorate endorsed the status quo." This is a very euphemistic way of saying the electorate rejected the Government's proposals. The electorate was not asked to vote on the status quo but on a new proposal which was roundly rejected. I note the good gloss and spin put on events. I concur with the Minister that the public need to understand what the legislation proposes. I refer to the explanatory memorandum which states:The purpose of this Bill is to establish a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework as set down by the Supreme Court in Maguire v. Ardagh
[2002] 1 IR 385, (the Abbeylara judgment). The Abbeylara case decided that Oireachtas inquiries do not have the power, in general, to make findings of fact adverse to the good name of any person who is not either a Member of the Houses or directly accountable to the Houses. Additionally, there are many legitimate inquiries that the Houses can undertake which would not infringe on the good name of private citizens.The Bill will establish the legal framework for the House to set up inquiries that do not impact or infringe the good name of people. This is already provided for in the Constitution. The Joint Committee on Health and Children held hearings last January and this week.In essence, that is the Oireachtas inquiring, recording and reporting. That is what the Joint Committee on Health and Children is doing without this legislation being in effect. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform had public hearings on freedom of information and reported on them to advise on future legislation. That is provided for in the legislation but it is already happening. The Committee of Public Accounts has the power to summon witnesses and report on people who are accountable to it, whether they are Accounting Officers or accountable officers, as some call them, such as chief executive officers of semi-state companies. That has already happened through the PAC. The House conducted an inquiry and moved to remove former Judge Brian Curtin from his office and procedures were in place to facilitate that. The process came to a speedy end at the end of the day but the power to remove an officeholder is enshrined in the Constitution and the House can do it. The Oireachtas has current powers to conduct inquiries into the conduct of its own Members. The essence of the national Parliament is its function of holding the Government to account. This is the current legal position. I ask, therefore, what is new in the legislation. I look at the short version in the explanatory memorandum, which indicates that the Bill provides specific statutory underpinning for five general types of Oireachtas inquiry ranging from inquiries limited to recording and reporting evidence to inquiries of an adjudicative nature where this flows from the existing constitutional powers of the Oireachtas. The Bill provides for a section 6 inquiry which is an inquiry to record and report, which is what the health committee is doing as we speak. Section 7 provides for inquiries relating to the exercise of a legislative function, including where there is a need for new legislation, which is what the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform did recently on freedom of information. Committees regularly hold hearings and make recommendations on future legislation. We already have a section 7 inquiry in practice, if not by name. Section 8 provides for an inquiry in relation to the removal of certain officeholders. We have already mentioned that in relation to Judge Brian Curtin. The Minister is putting a new title on an existing procedure. Section 9 provides for an inquiry into the conduct of a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas and it goes without saying that such a power is there already. The only issue is to ensure that Members exercise their powers properly, which they have not always done. It is an issue to be arranged pursuant to the Standing Orders of the House, not legislation. Section 10 is the big one and gives the Dáil the power to undertake an inquiry into the conduct of a current officeholder, senior civil servant or chief executive officer of a public body who is liable to account to the Dáil by virtue of his or her terms of office. Section 10 has given the Dáil the power to conduct an inquiry into certain officeholders - Ministers. That is what the Dáil is here for; that is what we were set up for when we got our independence. The Dáil is here to hold the Government to account but the Government is now providing to call an inquiry that makes the Dáil hold the Government to account a "section 10 inquiry". Every one of the inquiries provided for already exists and already happens. I accept that they might function better with an improvement to Standing Orders, but they are there already. The question is what is the purpose of the legislation. The Minister has drafted the legislation to provide for five new types of inquiries but is already unhappy with his own definitions of them. There is already a suggestion that the banking inquiry may be a hybrid section 6 and section 7 inquiry. He is introducing a new form of inquiry as he is not happy with the legislation he has drafted himself. Looking at the legislation in detail, I find it extraordinary that there are several references to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the new Standing Orders it will be required to implement. The Minister says the legislation does not want to encroach on the Houses of the Oireachtas, but practically everything provided for in the Bill could be done by the Oireachtas improving its own Standing Orders. I have already made it clear that the Oireachtas is not permitted to have new powers because the Abbeylara judgment continues to hold and the referendum was defeated. We are as we were and all we are doing here is asking the Oireachtas to improve its terms of reference on the conduct of inquiries to make them more transparent. What we are doing, I accept, is putting a legal framework on current practice. It is a tidying up exercise but we are not introducing any new powers. The legislation runs to 130 sections and 96 pages. What is interesting is that no funding is provided for anywhere in the Bill for any of the inquiries set out. No resources or budget is provided for and there is no mechanism to provide for funds or resources to be obtained. There is no mention of where the funding is to come from to pay for all of this. It sends a clear signal about the detail of the legislation. Perhaps the legislation does some good, but we must ensure it does no harm. On closer examination, it appears that it could do harm. A specific issue to which I want to refer is bias. It is an issue which was raised during the referendum campaign last year and during the public hearings recently. It is dealt with extensively in section 18, which refers to the "reasonable man" standard, which we all accept. I accept also that the bias issue is not as significant now that we will not be making findings in relation to a person's good name. Had the referendum been passed and we were making findings on character and conduct, the issue of bias would be much more important. While we are not allowed to make those findings, the issue of bias is still an important one. We should be clear that the Oireachtas is full of bias. We would not be here if we did not have a point of view. We should, therefore, get real on the bias issue. People in Fine Gael or the parties whose members sit behind me have diametrically opposed views on many issues and will come to any committee with their particular perspectives. They are elected by the people who vote for them because they have the particular views and biases. In fact, the Oireachtas should be representative of the collective opinions of the public on these matters. I do not have any problem with that. Where there is a problem is with the make up of a committee in terms of bias. The Government has a majority of two to one. That applies in the select committees that deal with the Estimates of the Minister's own Department and right across the Houses. There are nine members on select committees; six from the Government side and three from the Opposition. Before we even start, an overwhelming majority is biased in favour of the Government's point of view. It is an issue which we will not be able to get around no matter how hard we try unless the Government agrees in the interests of fair play to provide for equal representation by Government and Opposition members. Another significant difficulty with the legislation is that it is aimed to provide for inquiries into Members of the Oireachtas and Ministers or chief executives or other officers who are accountable to it. The tragedy, which there is no getting around, is that if the Dáil dissolves, all work in progress by a committee is lost and gone forever. It cannot be reused because it pertains to a particular Dáil. Some sections of the Bill refer to the "Oireachtas" and "the Houses" and some to "the Dáil". If a committee established on foot of terms of reference has published an interim report, there is provision to protect such a report for the benefit of a future Oireachtas. Any work done before an interim report can be published and any work carried out after such a report has been published will be lost and the subsequent Oireachtas will have to start again. There could be a tremendous waste of time, energy and resources. I ask the Minister to try to square the circle, although I do not know how he can. Obviously, we will table amendments to require committees to present three or six-months interim reports. While they might have to be short, they will protect the work that has been done up to that point. I would hate to see a year's work go down the drain should the Labour Party fall out with its partners in government and a sudden election be called. These things can happen on the night of a budget. It would be a dreadful shame and suggests we need a mechanism to protect the work that has been done. The Bill will require amendment on Committee Stage and provisions in this regard to be included in the terms of reference. I was confused looking at the Bill and do not like the way it is drafted. It is not tidy, but we are stuck with it now. All good legislation has the definitions at the beginning, but that is not the case here. We have definitions cropping up throughout its pages and new definitions for new provisions.Some will say legislation covering all parts is included at the beginning but in the case of a reference in Part 10 that is not in any other part, it is impossible to go to page 93 to find a definition of something referred to on page 107. I do not agree with it. The Minister referred to drafting documents in electronic form and the use of computers. Perhaps the Minister can confirm, on Committee Stage, that information held through cloud computing will be captured within this. I ask for that to be clarified. A major issue concerns section 10. There is misunderstanding among the public with regard to section 10. The explanatory memorandum states that Dáil Éireann, and interestingly not the Seanad, will have the power to undertake an inquiry into the conduct of a current officeholder. That is fine because the Committee of Public Accounts comprises Deputies only, not Senators, and it is not a joint committee. The Government is answerable to the Dáil and, technically, the Government is not answerable to the Seanad. The explanatory memorandum refers to current officeholders but the legislation on page 21, section 10(2)(c)(I)(i), refers to "an officeholder (or former officeholder)". That gives the impression to the public that findings can be made against former officeholders but that is not the intention of the Minister. I ask him to clarify that by way of amendment on Committee Stage. This concerns an inquiry in respect of officeholders who report to this Dáil and it is intended to capture a Minister who is no longer in government but was in government during the term of the Dáil. Any reasonable person would think the reference to former officeholder refers to former Ministers. It does not and it needs to be clarified. It is confusing and most people are entitled to take the view that it captures former Ministers. There can be no historic inquiries. The Minister says the electorate voted for the status quo but I say they rejected the amendment proposed by the Minister. That must be clarified. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for inquiries by the Oireachtas into the current Government and key people in key positions at the moment, the accountable people. Any finding cannot deal with former Members. If a member of the Government, or a Member of the House, is subject to inquiry and he sees an unfavourable or adverse finding coming down the tracks, the Member can resign from the House and no adverse findings can be made. This is interesting and we must deal with it on Committee Stage. If there is the possibility of an adverse finding, resigning a Dáil seat means the person is not a Member of the House and, according to the legislation, an adverse finding cannot be made against the person. This is the case even if the person is a Member of the House up until the day before the finding is due to be published. At that point, the finding cannot be made. Many people will think there is an escape hatch for a politician who would like to escape an unfavourable adjudication by a committee. Nothing can be said once the person is not a Member and is in the same position as the former officeholders to whom I referred. I do not know the legal mechanism but it should capture all Members of the Oireachtas, regardless of when they resign. Once they are elected to this Oireachtas, Members should be subject to inquiry by the Oireachtas. The Minister must also deal with the issue of work not being carried forward. The explanatory memorandum refers to section 11 providing for a parliamentary mechanism whereby a proposal to conduct an inquiry is assessed by the individual or committee. Standing Orders must be drawn up to facilitate that. Practically everything required to be done requires new Standing Orders of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 12 provides that, within the commencement of the section of the Act, the Oireachtas must pass the new Standing Orders to deal with an inquiry mechanism by a committee. We return to the Standing Orders of the House. Why does the House not get on with drafting Standing Orders now? In that case, we would not need some of the legislation. Nothing prevents the House doing what will be forced on it by the legislation. Perhaps the House has not been operating as effectively as it might and has not been using the powers it has. We must pass legislation telling the House that, within 50 days after the commencement notice, the House shall make rules and Standing Orders referred to in subsection (1)(a). The House should get on with that and do it now. It does not need to be told by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. People ask what is going on in the Dáil. Examining the legislation and considering everything that must be done under Standing Orders, the question must be raised why it is not being done through Standing Orders at this stage. The legislation does not make the Oireachtas do it because the Minister is clear he does not want to interfere in Oireachtas proceedings. The Minister is hinting and suggesting and saying that he will give the Oireachtas 50 days. No one has analysed the following problem in detail. The Minister is setting up a raft of new Oireachtas committees. I am dumbfounded. Section 104 sets up a Part 10 committee. Section 104 deals with a committee deciding on the adjudication on private papers, a topic close to the heart of the Minister. In section 109, it provides for a Part 11 committee being established and people will be interested to know why we need such a committee. Under section 116 we set up a section 16 committee and section 76, on page 64, sets up a section 76 committee. Sections 11 and 12 deal with the Part 11 committee. I count half a dozen committees provided for in the legislation. They may only be set up for a short period but I question why we must set these committees in legislation. There is nothing preventing the Oireachtas doing so through Standing Orders and I query why we include it in legislation. Section 20, on page 29, deals with witnesses having absolute privilege under the Defamation Act. The Minister is changing how this is dealt with. I was at a committee meeting this afternoon. It was made clear by the Chairman that a person must cease giving evidence on a particular topic when directed to do so by the committee. However, this legislation refers to direction by the Chairman. The current Defamation Act, which is read out at every Oireachtas committee meeting where witnesses give evidence, refers to ceasing to provide evidence on the particular topic if directed by the committee. This legislation refers to the direction of the Chairman and I wonder whether the Chairman has such a right. There is a reason the committee must make the decision for someone to desist rather than a unilateral decision of the Chairman. It is not that there is anything wrong with it but it is unclear and seems slightly different. Committees can go to the High Court and the Director of Public Prosecutions can take a case to the High Court. Fines of €500,000 and sentences of up to five years in prison can be made if people are in breach of these measures or not co-operating. It must go by way of the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the High Court. Section 60 is a reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission making Standing Orders. This is a ticking off for the Oireachtas from the Minister. He is saying that the Oireachtas has powers and asks it to pass Standing Orders under these sections to conduct a robust inquiry. The Minister is saying the Oireachtas has the authority to do so but needs a legal statutory framework and that nothing is preventing the Oireachtas doing so. Section 68 is one of the more serious sections in the legislation. It exempts certain evidence from being heard. Where are we going with this? The Minister said the purpose of this is to set up a banking inquiry.However, section 68 provides that the committee shall not direct a person to give evidence if it relates to discussions of a meeting of a Government or a committee appointed by the Government. They cannot give evidence to the committee-----

I am just letting the people know. The Minister is setting up an inquiry into what Government Ministers did on a particular night, or that appears to be what he said. However, the legislation provides that no papers relating to discussions in a meeting of the Government or a committee of the Government can be disclosed.

In addition, the legislation provides that the committee will not even be entitled to ask for papers relating to discussions of a meeting of the Government or of a committee appointed by the Government or relating to discussions at a meeting of a committee appointed by the Government whose membership consists of more than one member of the Government. The committee cannot seek information if the evidence or document could, if given, be expected to prejudice criminal proceedings. People can understand that. The committee cannot seek evidence if the evidence or document could, and this is very important regarding that night, "reasonably be expected to adversely affect the security of the State or to be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states". We are in the eurozone. Everything that was done that night affected our relations with other EU or eurozone countries. The Germans had an interest in it. The English Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer were on the telephone at nine o'clock the following morning. Everything that happened that night had an impact on our relations with member states of the eurozone. However, the Bill provides that the committee cannot ask for information if that information could be "prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states". What happened that night was prejudicial. People talked about how Ulster Bank, banks in the State, banks in Northern Ireland and banks in the UK did not have the guarantee which the covered institutions here had. Everything that was done that night was prejudicial to some countries in the EU, but the Bill provides that the committee cannot even seek that information to discuss it. I agree with the need for the inquiry but the committee will be unrealistically constrained in terms of what is permitted to be given to it. I am aware that Cabinet confidentiality is an issue. Also, the committee cannot seek information if it would interfere with the prevention, detection or investigation of an offence, nor can it seek information relating to information being kept for the purpose of assessing the liability of a person in respect of tax, duty or other payment payable to the State, local authority or HSE. In respect of the general scheme of taxation, it cannot seek papers if they relate to the collection of taxes. There are many exemptions in the section that are fundamental to many issues people wish to discuss. Section 69 puts the tin hat on this. It states that if a person is asked to give information or evidence and they are of the opinion they should not do so because it is in breach of some of the matters referred to in the earlier section, they can provide a letter to that effect and "the committee shall, if necessary, adjourn the proceedings concerned in relation to the particular matter for such period as it considers appropriate in the circumstances". We have encountered that in the Committee of Public Accounts. It can be supported with a letter from a Minister and the committee of inquiry will be stopped in its tracks. We have seen that happen in the House previously. The Minister thinks there is good reason for that provision, but the public right to know should supersede it on those issues. That must be dealt with. That relates to the Part 2 inquiries under sections 6 to 10, inclusive. The Minister has provided for similar powers in sections 83 and 84 with regard to ordinary committees of the House. There is the same exclusion regarding the right of access to information. The Minister has spancelled the committee before it starts. Under section 96, the committee can go to the High Court if somebody is not co-operating. Finally, adverse findings can only be made against a current Member. Somebody who resigns can get out the door and the committee cannot say anything about him or her. It also cannot say anything about somebody who was a member of a previous Administration. The difficulty is that some of these inquiries could extend beyond the term of a Dáil, so all the work will be lost. If a Member is facing a problem, he or she can hightail it out the door and get off scot free. There is also the issue that was raised in respect of all tribunals of inquiry in the past. Evidence adjudicated in any of these inquiries cannot be used in any further proceedings, even disciplinary proceedings. If somebody is shown to have misbehaved at an inquiry, it cannot be used in disciplinary proceedings thereafter, let alone court proceedings. I understand the complications, and perhaps the Minister cannot get around them. However, people should be aware that this new legislation that the Minister has trumpeted has plenty of bells and whistles, but no substance.

Bhí sí in ainm a bheith ár gcéad chainteoir. I have an interest in this legislation due to my role as the party Whip and as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. There are provisions in the Bill, which I will discuss later, that I hope will address an issue that has bedevilled us for many years, the question of privilege in this House. It has never been fully explained. Hopefully, the Bill will address the issue in respect of the private papers of Members which are held by Members in pursuing their work in this House. It was always presumed to exist but in the last number of years we have discovered that the privilege had never been defined as intended through legislation. The issue is being addressed in this Bill and that is welcome. The other reason I had an interest in speaking on the Bill is that I am a member of a committee that was established when the Government took office and which was originally intended to be an investigations, petitions and oversight committee. The investigation part disappeared when the referendum result slapped Members of the House on the wrist and told us to back off. The reason I mention that committee is that I believe it could play an important role when the Bill is passed, the role originally intended for it. It is disappointing that we are discussing a Bill that was produced last Friday. We knew it was due to be published because, in fairness to the Minister, he published the heads of the Bill previously and there was a discussion about it. However, the convention or rule is that there should be two weeks between the publication of a Bill and the discussion on Second Stage. There is also supposed to be a two week gap between each Stage, so the Committee Stage debate should take place two weeks after the conclusion of Second Stage and the Report Stage should take place two weeks after that. That has not happened in many cases. A document was produced in 2004 entitled "Regulating Better" and all parties agreed with the principles in it. There was supposed to be a regulatory impact assessment of all legislation but, to my knowledge, only one has been produced in recent years. I urge Ministers to go back to the usual practice, so Deputies will have sufficient time to peruse legislation and investigate it properly, especially when one is presented with a Bill that has 95 pages. As I said, I had seen the heads and discussed it with my party members and with other parties, so it did not take us by surprise. However, legislation is due to be published today which will be discussed on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. A social welfare Bill was published yesterday and it is intended to discuss it next Thursday. It appears to be a habit of the Government to rush legislation. The reason I raise this, particularly given what we are dealing with in this Bill, is that rushed legislation can be bad legislation. There should have been time to pause on this. It is bad practice. The programme for Government gave a commitment to publish the general scheme of this Bill, after which the committee could discuss it. That did not fully happen. When the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform was dealing with the heads of the Bill, it was given only 13 days in which to do so. The heads are quite extensive, as reflected in the Bill itself. The timeframe meant the committee did not have time to seek the observations of interested groups and individuals. When one considers the background to the legislation, one realises that the public bodies that lobbied against us in the referendum campaign - the referendum legislation had been passed in the House – had a particular view on how this House would conduct inquiries or investigations in the future. It would have been appropriate to ask some of those groups for their views. I refer in particular to those in the legal field, including the Irish Human Rights Commission, that are tasked with the oversight of legislation. I include the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Bar Council and Law Society, which have expertise although some might question that. Some bodies advised the public that the inquiry method originally intended by the House should not be proceeded with. A mistake was made at the time in question. When Second Stage of this Bill is completed, I urge the Minister to give us time to receive counsel from those within our party and outside it who have a view on the legislation, which is quite extensive. The timeframe is clearly inadequate to facilitate even the most proficient legal expert in scrutinising it properly. It is disappointing that the Minister, who has committed himself to the reform of legislative procedures, would seek to rush this legislation. That said, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform had significant responsibilities and should have been given the opportunity to deal more fully with the heads of the Bill, as originally produced. Professor David Farrell wrote some days after the people had rejected the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries last year that the fall of the Government’s proposition was, at least, a disappointment for the Government. He asked whether it was really all that surprising that the proposition that was put to the people fell as it did not help that the citizens were not given a greater say in the process leading up to defining the referendum question. He stated the rationale for and design of the referendum question was imposed from the top without any effort to engage with citizens in advance. A lesson should have been learned. We made a mistake at the time in question and I hope we are not making one again. The Bill before us is somewhat controversial because it comes on the back of a referendum that was rejected. For some, it will be seen as a way around that referendum result. I hope this legislation will stand the test of any constitutional challenge, if such a challenge arises. I believe the Houses of the Oireachtas, including its committees, should not be hampered in inquiring into matters of public policy. I am fully behind the principle and intention of this Bill. I want to ensure that what we are to produce will stand up to scrutiny. The Minister has said this Bill provides for much more than simply a banking inquiry. A banking inquiry would be welcome. The legislation is establishing a comprehensive and detailed framework to enable the Oireachtas to hold inquiries of the kind intended before constitutional parameters were imposed on us by the Abbeylara judgment. Those inquiries are outside the day-to-day workings of the Oireachtas, including its committees. We, as politicians, are undertaking to take on an extra workload. I hope all the Members of this House and future Houses understand the onerous responsibility that will fall on them when they end up on a committee of inquiry.  The legislation replaces the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act and contains certain detailed provisions with regard to legal costs and expenses, privileges with regard to private papers and confidential communications and fair procedures. The legislation is significant and it follows on from the failed referendum. The proposed constitutional amendment that sought to restore the pre-Abbeylara position whereby an Oireachtas committee could have the same powers of inquiry as any other statutory inquiry was voted down. In many ways, I believe we did not set out our case fully. I will not call for a rerun of the referendum. With hindsight, however, we can all see how we failed in our duty to try to explain to the public our position. In the Abbeylara case, a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas proposed that a sub-committee inquire into the incident in which Mr. John Carty was gunned down by gardaí who had surrounded his house when a siege developed. The committee issued directions to persons to attend, give evidence and be subject to cross-examination. The members of An Garda Síochána objected and the matter ended up in the courts. The Supreme Court rightly held at that stage that the Oireachtas could not hold such inquiries and it restricted the powers. The court said the Oireachtas could hold inquiries to better direct its purposes but not the type of inquiry envisaged in the Abbeylara case because it would have a significant impact on the rights of those appearing before it. The court found that:[A]n inquiry cannot be compared to a simple search for knowledge to adjudicate on the culpability of citizens in their conduct and cannot in my view be equated with the everyday search for knowledge of facts. That is a governmental power which it seems to me can only be exercised by virtue of power conferred by the Constitution. That power is conferred by the constitution on the judiciary.It is a question of the separation of powers. The court found that the Abbeylara committee would have been in conflict with the Judiciary. While we supported the proposed constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's Abbeylara judgment, we expressed concern with what we believed was a significant shortfall in the proposition at the time. We stated the initial wording presented by the Government was ambiguous with regard to the position of the Oireachtas in determining natural justice. On that basis, we submitted an additional subsection to the legislation stating: "The conduct of such inquiries shall be regulated in accordance with the law and the principles of natural justice." Following constructive engagement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, and in response to concerns raised by others, including non-Members, the referendum proposition was amended on Report Stage with the inclusion of the words "with due regard to the principles of fair procedure". That is reflected in this Bill. Section 18 states a Member of the House shall not be, or continue to be, a committee member if, by reason of his or her connection or dealings with any matter the subject of the inquiry, a perception of bias might arise in a reasonable person.It is important to ensure that fair procedure, and all of the other procedures, are outlined. There has to be fair procedure. That is welcome and it is to be hoped it will address any of the concerns of those who opposed the referendum. It is not uncommon or unprecedented for parliaments to have the powers of inquiry the Abbeylara committee sought. The US, Britain and Australia are some examples of countries where such powers are regarded as an important thread in the fabric of democracy. The Oireachtas is a people's parliament and politicians are democratically elected to serve and represent their interests. We are also elected to hold those who are in government to account and to challenge those who work against the public interest. The proposed 30th amendment to the Constitution was put to the people in 2011 and was defeated. Whether it was a narrow or large defeat does not make any difference; it was defeated. In rejecting the amendment citizens clearly told the Government, and all of us in this House and the Upper House, that they were not minded to extend such powers to politicians. The Minister has managed to address that in the Bill and it is to be hoped it will withstand a test. It is quite clear from the Bill that we are not taking on powers to which we are not entitled according to the Constitution, the Supreme Court and the people in 2011. Part of the concern I have is that the Minister told us the Bill has been drafted in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General in order to ensure that it complies fully with the court judgment and fully respects the constitutional parameters of parliamentary inquiries as set out down in the Abbeylara case. Attorneys General are not infallible. Sometimes it might be useful for the Government to relinquish the hold it has on the advice of Attorneys General and publish it. It would be useful, especially given the context of the Bill. It could be liable to challenge if and when we set up an inquiry. Somebody called before the committee might decide to challenge its constitutionality, given the Abbeylara judgment. The Attorney General gave advice to the Labour Party before the election to the effect that we could change upward-only rent reviews. However, in office the Labour Party said it could not be done. During the children's rights referendum, the Supreme Court ruled that the Government referendum information booklet and website were flawed and were not fair, equal or impartial, and that extensive passages in the booklets and on the website did not conform to the McKenna principles. Following the judgment, it was confirmed by a spokesperson from the Department that the booklet and website had been thoroughly examined to ensure they were in compliance with the McKenna judgment by the Office of the Attorney General.  I am not casting aspersions on the Attorney General; that is not my intention. The advice of the Attorney General can be wrong and has been found to be so not only in the case of the current officeholder, but others. In the interests of what we are trying to do, it might be useful for committee purposes that the advice be published or at least made available to committee members in order that they can see it can stand up to the test we as politicians can put it to. The Bill is welcome. While many of the considered concerns of organisations such as the ICCL have been addressed, not least because the Government has had to draft legislation within the confines of the Constitution, some concerns remain. During the 2011 referendum campaign, Dr. Eoin O'Malley of DCU noted only a majority in the Dáil could call an inquiry and that it could not legislate to allow a minority to call an inquiry. Any inquiry is dependent on the support of the Government. We should examine that and consider whether the majority of 50% plus one minimum should remain or whether we can develop another mechanism to allow inquiries in the public interest to take place. During that campaign some voiced concerns that the constitutional amendment rendered the courts' role in reviewing parliamentary inquiries as negligible. Part 9 of the Bill appears to deal with those concerns, but again time is needed to consider the full details.  Concerns were also expressed regarding the power to investigate individuals other than officeholders. The Bill contains a list outlining into whom an inquiry can be conducted. It includes Oireachtas Members or any person liable to Dáil scrutiny by contract or statutory appointment. The list might need to be extended. For instance, it refers to the CEOs of companies. Often it is not just the CEO that one might want to meet, rather, one might want to meet a person who has a more operational role. We need to question whether we have an exhaustive list or whether under the restrictions in the Bill and those imposed by the Constitution we have the powers to deal with those who are not officeholders and public servants. The matter will be teased out on Committee Stage. The Joint Committee on the Constitution's fifth report on Article 15 of the constitutional review of the parliamentary power of inquiry was quite clear. In its opinion, to investigate private individuals a constitutional amendment would be required. This will throw up its own challenges when the banking inquiry is held and that is why we need time to ensure that the detail of this Bill gives us the power to hold such an inquiry and that it is meaningful. We believe consideration should be given to a single investigations committee for the reasons provided in the programme for Government. Such a committee was established. The other committee people have talked about in regard to this Bill which might be suitable to hold a banking inquiry, is the Committee of Public Accounts, one of the most powerful committees of the Oireachtas. It is regarded as important by the citizens. It deals with accounts and the cost of governance. It may not be the appropriate committee to hold a banking inquiry; a different committee might be more suitable. When the programme for Government delivered the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, it was originally intended to be a committee of investigation. That might be more suitable. I am not looking for extra work; I have enough work and am on too many committees. As a member of that committee, I know it is the clearing house for ombudsman reports and is building up a degree of expertise. I urge the Minister to consider whether either of those committees could hold a banking inquiry. They could perhaps be a clearing house for such an inquiry and could bring in expertise. The Bill already provides for safeguards against bias. I mentioned section 18, which is welcome. It states that a Member shall not be a member of a committee conducting an inquiry if reasonable perception of bias might arise. Flexibilities could be provided for committee membership depending on the inquiry taking place.There is a problem in this regard, however, which should be addressed in the legislation. Anybody who was here when the House sought to set up an inquiry to deal with former judge Brian Curtin will remember the hoops we had to jump through to find somebody who had not commented in any way, publicly or otherwise, on the matter. I was not a member of either committee and had not commented on the matter at the time. This begs a question. In the case of the banking inquiry, for example, where and how will bias be defined? Every Member of this House has made a comment on the issue, whether inside or outside the Chamber, including, in many cases, in the course of election campaigns or in campaign literature. We have all articulated where we perceive the fault to lie and so on. We are on a difficult road because perception of bias is in the eye of the beholder. Whoever is charged with making that determination will have an unenviable task. Section 6 deals with making findings of fact on these matters. Again, it would be helpful to have sight of the Attorney General's advice in this regard. Concerns will be raised in respect of sections 8 to 10, inclusive. While these provisions simply provide a legislative framework for provisions already within the Constitution, it is our strong view that clarity will be required in the public debate on the Bill and the debate surrounding the establishment of any inquiry. A previous speaker questioned the progression of the Bill on the basis that it provides enhanced powers for the Seanad to hold inquiries. The position at this time is that the Upper House still exists and, as such, the legislation is obliged to deal with it. However, if it is indeed the intention of the Government to abolish the Seanad, we will be amending this legislation within weeks of its passage. There is always the possibility, of course, that the people will reject the Government's proposition. There was an opportunity for the Government to get off the hook on which it placed itself in terms of the abolition of the Seanad by designating the matter for consideration by the Constitutional Convention. That body could have teased out the issues before making a report, which might have been a more informed strategy than simply indulging in the knee-jerk reaction that is the plan to abolish the Seanad as a cost-saving exercise and to deal with some of the rowdy individuals in that House. The rushed manner in which this Bill is being dealt with is deeply disappointing. While many of the concerns raised during the referendum debate have been addressed by the Minister and his officials, public scrutiny and debate in respect of the proposals has been sparse. I accept that it is sometimes difficult to get the public and even the commentariat to engage in debate on a complex and abstract issue such as this. We now at least have a concrete framework, in the form of these legislative proposals, on which that discussion can be focused. Surely, however, if there was any outstanding item of legislation from the Department which absolutely required such urgent attention, it is the Bill on whistleblowers. That should have been the first port of call. It is clearer than ever, in the wake of the public statements by the Minister for Justice and Equality on 15 May, that this long-awaited legislation is urgently needed. The Bill is intended to provide guidance to Ministers and senior public sector officials as to the appropriate manner in which whistleblowers should be treated. Moreover, some of the inquiries that will be set up under the provisions of the Bill we are discussing today could well be dependent on whistleblowers coming forward with information. Bringing that information to bear will be vital in allowing Members to appeal to the Government to establish inquiries as envisaged under this legislation. I look forward, with my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, to dealing with the Bill in committee. I hope we will have legislation that can stand the test of time and is in the interests of the public in general.

It is an important debate as it deals with inquiries relating to the actions of Members of the Oireachtas and those who occupy public office. We must accept that politics in this country has been damaged by the actions of a minority of Members of the Dáil and Seanad. It is important to emphasise that point. All politicians, unfortunately, have been labelled or damaged by the actions of a cohort of corrupt colleagues. It is too easy to dismiss politicians as being all the same. In fact, the vast majority are honoured to be elected to the Oireachtas and do their best for their constituents and their country. That is an important point to make in considering this legislation. Regardless of political differences, most Members are in the profession for the right reason. Regrettably, it is all too easy to be cynical or to play the hurler on the ditch. Having said that, it is vital that politicians uphold certain standards and behave in such a way as to enhance democracy and public life in this country. Bribery and corruption must be rooted out of politics and I hope this legislation will assist that process. It is in this context that I welcome the Bill. The recent by-election was a wake-up call for us in that 62% of the electorate stayed at home. We must be proactive in setting standards. The past week has been a bad one for politics, with a senior Minister crossing a line and acting as if nothing happened. That is only one example of what we are dealing with here. To take another example, I look forward, as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, to dealing in due course, in a professional, objective and balanced way, with a report on the penalty points issue. I have major concerns with the way in which whistleblowers are dealt with, but that is a discussion for another day. It is important, however, to acknowledge that issue in this debate. The Bill aims to develop a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries. The context for the proposals goes back to the Abbeylara judgment, includes the rejected 2011 referendum and the 2012 report by the Committee of Public Accounts on a preliminary framework for an Oireachtas inquiry into the domestic banking crisis, and encompasses the Ivor Callely case, which is awaiting a Supreme Court judgment. The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated earlier in the course of his contribution on the Bill:Such inquiries could represent a very substantial strengthening in the effectiveness and contribution of the Legislature to our democratic system by not only helping us learn vital lessons from past events but, through their recommendations, identifying the legislative reforms and policy changes essential to making sure that egregious policy errors are not repeated.That is a very welcome statement. We must strengthen the effectiveness of the Legislature. We must learn from the past and from the huge cost to taxpayers of the various tribunals. We also must learn from the disgraceful scandals that emerged in recent years. They must never be forgotten and should be used as an example to clean up Irish politics. The Minister also said: "The Bill will enhance the effective functioning of our modern parliamentary democracy by facilitating such inquiries." This is a vital aspect of the legislation. As it stands, there are three public inquiry mechanisms, namely, Oireachtas inquiries, tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation. Oireachtas inquiries are carried out by Oireachtas committees and, according to the legislation, are set up to investigate internal Oireachtas issues and any issues mandated by legislation. An example of such an investigation is the very successful DIRT inquiry, which brought in a substantial volume of revenue and rooted out corruption within the system. A similar type of investigation has also been undertaken at European level, where the figure for tax evasion is apparently in the region of €1 trillion.In Ireland, we are chasing householders for a property tax of €200 or €300 while €1 trillion is being scammed across Europe. The European leaders, the Taoiseach and the Minister of State must focus on, and think about, these issues. I mention this in connection with the Oireachtas inquiries. There have also been tribunals of inquiry which were set up by the Oireachtas but carried out independently, usually by a sole member. A tribunal has the powers of the High Court, including to compel attendance and the production of documents. A tribunal is solely inquisitorial. It is set up under the Tribunals of Inquiries Acts, an example being the Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, the Moriarty tribunal. This Government seems to avoid and run away from this process. We must deal with these issues and learn from the examples of the past. The third type of inquiry is a commission of investigation. This is a body established with specified functions to inquire into a specific and once-off matter under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. Evidence is generally taken in private and the commission has the power to compel witnesses and documents, for example, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. They had a very good record and have done fantastic work and are very important. We should not run away from issues that need a commission of investigation, for example, the murder of Fr. Niall Molloy. His family is very concerned as are many members of the media. The family wants a proper investigation of this issue. There was a cover-up and this should be highlighted. The role of whistleblowers is also important in giving evidence to inquiries. I am deeply saddened by what happened to the two whistleblowers in the recent incident involving Deputy Wallace and penalty points. Those two gardaí were treated very badly and one had to leave the force. I urge the Government to get on with publishing the planned legislation for whistleblowers because if they do not, Deputy Ross has drafted a Bill and the Independent Deputies will bring it in here and deal effectively with it. We must ensure that people who serve this State and expose corruption are protected. I am not talking about cranks. I am talking about genuine people with a good public service ethos. In Austria, Luxembourg and the Netherlands there is provision qualifying the right by the requirement that it be regulated by law. In a number of countries the power to compel testimony and the production of documents is specifically referred to in the constitution, for example, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Spain. Italy and Portugal specify that parliamentary committees of inquiry are to have the same powers of investigation and to be subject to the same legal limitations on those powers as the courts. In the cases of Germany and Spain, the constitutions state that the findings of a parliamentary inquiry are not binding on the courts though the findings themselves may not be subject to judicial review. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. We held a very good inquiry into, and investigation of, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We did a lot of work, met the victims and the families of those who died and people who were directly and indirectly involved. The Dáil passed a motion supporting the recommendations of the committee which were passed on to the British Government, but it refused to act on them or to facilitate action on them. We need to do something about this because the families of those killed feel very let down. I urge the Government to up its game and raise this issue constantly with the British Government because cover-ups on such matters will not help the peace process. We have heard a lot of talk recently about the peace process and about healing. We need truth and justice for the victims of the conflict. Part 8 of the Bill, sections 89 to 100, relate to Members of the Oireachtas. The following are only answerable to the Seanad or the Dáil: utterances before a committee, documents, official reports and publications of a committee. Committee documents that are not public cannot be disclosed without written consent from the committee chairman. State employees are barred from expressing an opinion on the merits of governmental and ministerial policy before a committee and the committee cannot request such an opinion. State employees may be called to give factual evidence. The programme for Government 2011 included a commitment to amend this to allow civil servants to comment on policy to reflect the reality of the authority delegated to them and their personal accountability for the way in which it is exercised. This Bill, however, does not include a provision on this policy. That is another example of a Government going back on its word. Part 2, section 9, provides for a power of inquiry relating to the conduct of a Member of either House of the Oireachtas and section 10 gives the Dáil the power to undertake an inquiry into the conduct of a current officeholder, senior civil servant or CEO of a public body. I welcome those sections. Part 3, section 14, limits the finding of facts that directly impugn a person's good name to certain categories of people. It is important to go through due process when dealing with this area. That is why I was extremely disappointed and angry during the week at the actions of the Minister for Justice and Equality in respect of the Deputy Wallace affair, the breach of privilege and the conduct of that Member. I will leave that to the Data Protection Commissioner and the Standards in Public Office Commission. Everyone, particularly those in public office, is entitled to his or her good name. I welcome the debate on this Bill. I hope it will go a long way to cleaning up Irish politics. It concerns genuine reform and change. I will support it as that was the mandate we all got at the last election, to bring about change, reform and decency in politics. It is a start but we have a long way to go. If we want to clean up politics and sensible legislation is brought before the House, everybody, regardless of political persuasion, should support it. The day of corruption in Irish politics has to come to an end. It has gone on too long and has destroyed this country. I say the same about people outside politics who are also responsible for bringing this country to its knees. This Bill represents a very big step in the process of clarifying the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in securing accountability through investigations into matters of significant public importance. We all have the honour and privilege of being elected to serve in this Dáil and we all have a duty to be accountable. When one Member of the Oireachtas is involved in corruption, he or she lets down the Oireachtas, democracy, the country, themselves, their families and the people who voted for them. This Bill is progressive. There are changes that could be made to it but the Government is open to amendments on later Stages. Overall, I welcome the legislation.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	394	I see this Bill pretty well exclusively as a response to the referendum in 2011 on Oireachtas inquiries. It is worth reflecting that it was expected throughout the campaign, such as it was, that the referendum would pass very easily because there was a huge impetus and enthusiasm at the time to get to the bottom of the banking crisis and find out what happened.That was the reason behind the referendum, although the flaws in the Constitution discovered by the Abbeylara judgment had made it very difficult for the Oireachtas to hold an inquiry. The result of this was the Government, responding to that overall desire and genuine enthusiasm among politicians to find out the truth, produced a fairly honourable, decent and genuine attempt to amend the Constitution to facilitate an inquiry by the Oireachtas to find out the truth. The result of that has been interpreted in this Bill in a way I am not sure that I share. The reason the constitutional referendum was defeated has not yet been recognised. The reason it was defeated was a reflection on us all. Like an express train, the argument was made towards the end of the campaign that Members of the Oireachtas were not the right people to be holding a banking inquiry and, more particularly, inquiries into other events which are related. The detail of that is that Members should not be making findings of fact or, in other words, specifically making judgments on people which are pejorative and unfair. I believe, however, it runs deeper than that. The population was giving a verdict and a message to the Government and to all Members that we are not the right people to be holding our peers and others to account. That is not a welcome message to us but it has a certain merit. It is difficult for us to accept it but giving politicians power to make findings of any sort is dubious. Giving politicians the power to hold inquiries which do not make findings is very close to that because the questions they will ask and the way the agenda is skewed will obviously bias it in one direction or the other. There is a crying need for a banking inquiry to find out what happened on that night on 29 September 2008 and who made what decisions. I feel uncomfortable, however, as others do, at the idea that politicians should be calling in other politicians to answer questions on their particular activities on that night and elsewhere. By very definition, if the Government sets up this inquiry and Oireachtas Members are appointed to it, the questions will be politically charged and it will be used for political advantage. I have no doubt about this; that is the way politics works. The idea of bringing in the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, to be questioned by Fine Gael and Labour Members has no more attraction for me than bringing in the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to be questioned by Fianna Fáil Members about his stewardship. It will lend itself to political charges, political grandstanding and no independent approach. That is the nature of politics. Should we really be judges and juries not only of our peers, but of anybody in making any findings or holding inquiries? I know, as Deputy Finian McGrath said, our powers of inquiry here are very weak considering those held by parliaments abroad. That is true but that is not necessarily the right argument for the small, compact and, sometimes incestuous, nation that we are. I feel uncomfortable about those of us elected to legislate holding inquiries over the behaviour of our peers and making judgments in political circumstances. I do not trust myself or any other politician to be independent in that situation. Of course, we must ask if we are not to make these sorts of judgments then who should hold inquiries of this sort. If there is to be, and there must be, a banking inquiry which will make findings of facts, then who should we put on it rather than politicians? That is the difficult question. Normally, people say throw in a few High Court judges as they are of impeccable pedigree which is not true at all as they are all appointed by politicians. We need to be constructive about it. Why could we not hold inquiries where verdicts are delivered by people selected in the same way a jury is selected? What is wrong with having 12 random people, chosen from the population to carry out these inquiries, people who have volunteered and are available? They would only need to have the same basic qualifications as jurors but could be disqualified for the same reasons jurors are disqualified. The Government has already devised a way of selecting people in a random way for the Constitutional Convention which seems to be working adequately. I have not seen any great criticism of the people chosen to make up the majority of the convention. Why can we not have inquiries into these matters of great national importance being held under the auspices of those chosen this way? It would provide a cross-section of people with no political baggage and who would make verdicts on events to which they have an objective and balanced view. We need to have a banking inquiry but we need to have a credible one. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said so eloquently, there is not one sinner in the House - I include the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews in this - who would have any credibility on a banking inquiry because they have such honourable opinions that they have given already but which are definitive opinions. I wrote a book about the bankers, which makes me completely unsuitable. Other Members have expressed opinions on people who would be appearing before an inquiry, Members who we are asking to give their objective opinion. There was one stage I thought I would have loved to chair a banking inquiry because I could have let the bankers have it between the eyes. I have changed my mind since. That would have been wrong. We must have people from the start who have not given public opinions which were biased. I hope I know what the verdicts would be. I hope the inquiry would condemn the bankers from a height but we must have an inquiry with credibility. We cannot let the inquiry comprise people who have been part of a chorus of those who have already expressed opinions. This does not just apply to banking inquiries but to all of them because in this House we have the most opinionated 166 people in Ireland. Everyone here has an opinion on virtually everything. That is what they are paid to have. However, it means their objectivity no longer exists. Let us not be tied up with the idea that we, as Oireachtas Members, should carry this torch. Why not look further afield and consider people who have a less subjective opinion on what is happening? We have committees to hold hearings and sometimes they are effective. They invite people to appear, ask questions or for their opinions and expose them. That sometimes works. The Committee of Public Accounts has compellability powers. As Deputy Finian McGrath said, that committee had one good hit when it scored on the DIRT inquiry some time ago, but the House has a lamentable record since on tame inquiries without compellability powers. This does not relate only to the Abbeylara inquiry which was a dismal, abject failure because it tried to exceed its powers and was stopped by the Supreme Court, but there were others. There was the mini-CTC case which was eventually abandoned, partly because a general election was called. The Callely inquiry ended up in a fiasco in the Supreme Court because it involved Oireachtas Members sitting in judgment on another Member. Why was that done? Why do we not have a scenario where there is not self-regulation? We are keen in condemning, rightly, self-regulation in the legal, accountancy and stockbroking professions and so on. In many cases, regulation has been reformed, but for some reason we want to sit in judgment on fellow Members. It is difficult to ask Members to do this because politicians have loyalties built up to each other over a long period and tend to vote and make judgments on the basis of party loyalty. It is probably impossible to ask them not to. I have been in the Oireachtas long enough to be a Member during the inquiry into the fall of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1992 initiated by the incoming Government. It was wrong of that Government to do this. I have no brief for it and I was in Fine Gael when it happened. What is a Government doing setting up an Oireachtas inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the fall of another? That was a kangaroo court and any Government can do this if we get into the habit of setting up such inquiries. There is a case for an inquiry into what is happening at the top of An Garda Síochána and the mysteries we have witnessed in recent months. A veil has been lifted regarding the force in recent days. There should be an inquiry into the Garda, but the last people who should hold such an inquiry are Oireachtas Members because the Garda Commissioner is appointed by the Minister of the day and is, therefore, a political appointee. Not only that, the current incumbent has been given a two year extension by the Minister. There is a crying need and public demand and hunger for an inquiry into the Garda. There is public discontent about how various incidents happened and how information is passed through the force from top to bottom. Imagine - this is no reflection on any Member - if those who appointed the Commissioner and the others at the top of the force made the appointments to an inquiry. That would be wrong and this legislation, in its devotion to giving Oireachtas Members who have such powers of patronage and such strong opinions and commitments the power to hold inquiries and, therefore, point public opinion in a certain direction, is something we should strongly challenge.

One of the many pleasures of being able to contribute in the House is that by a quirk of good luck I always seem to follow Deputy Shane Ross. This is something I also experienced during the previous Seanad. On hearing his latest eloquent reflection, I was given pause to think there were two Deputy Shane Rosses. The first is the orator, the man who has just made his contribution on the Bill and skilfully laid out the reasons he has such concerns about it, while the second is the man I witness at the Committee of Public Accounts each Thursday and at other committee meetings who is the inquisitor. There could be a third Deputy Shane Ross because he admitted he had changed his mind on something also and that might be Deputy Shane Ross the humble or the wise. What gives me pause for thought following his contribution is the inconsistency between the two. Deputy Shane Ross the orator will powerfully deliver judgments on issues in the House, while the Deputy Shane Ross I see in full flow at the Committee of Public Accounts skilfully and adroitly holds witnesses to account every Thursday. I thought they were one and the same until this afternoon.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	401	The Acting Chairman may share the same envy. Deputy Shane Ross's constituents trust him because of his ability to query individuals and issues in other fora apart from the Oireachtas. If his constituents trust him to perform that role well, why should we not allow such a role to be performed with proper functions and capacities by the Oireachtas? Why should we not allow that role to be performed with the support most other parliaments have available to them? Why should we not allow the Deputy or any other Member to have the ability to inquire into matters on behalf of the people in the way most other parliaments can? One of the reasons there might be a reluctance to do this, which was touched on by him, is the difficulty with politicians making judgments about other politicians. That happens every day of the week in the House during Leaders' Questions and ministerial Question Time, during which politicians form judgments about other politicians on how they discharge their duties in comparison to what happened in the past. If it is appropriate for this to happen in the House during the normal cut and thrust of political debate, why does the Deputy say it is not appropriate for it to happen effectively with legislative underpinning in other branches of the Oireachtas? The counter charge to that, which I have heard and which Deputy Ross outlined, is that there may be the temptation to grandstand or for political gamesmanship. That temptation could be there but what this Bill will change is the consequences of that kind of behaviour. It will ensure that if members of a committee make statements which cannot be backed up by facts, which are gained in that committee, they will face the consequences of that action. We should give ourselves the capacity to see if we can discharge this function, which is what I believe this Bill will do, rather than assume we cannot because of the political culture. Surely the best way to change a political culture or the levels of commentary here is by giving the Oireachtas the ability to do this job properly, which every other parliament has, and then trust Members to perform that role well. Surely that is the case we should put.  I enjoyed listening to Deputy Ross's worries about people forming judgments or forming reservations in regard to the work they may do. Deputy Ross does that every day of the week. He does it in the House and elsewhere, and he does it well. If he trusts himself to do that well elsewhere, why should he not trust himself not to do so properly in a committee which is supported and well-resourced and has a Bill like this behind it? If we do not trust ourselves to do this, who should do it? Deputy Ross went through some of the candidates there. I will make two points in this regard. The first point is that if this House was to set up another body to discharge the functions most people think we should discharge, the first criticism laid against this Government, or the Oireachtas, would be that we were setting up another quango and that we should do that work ourselves. I presume that Deputy Ross would be one of the first people to make that charge given his clear expertise in that area.  The second point, which Deputy Ross laid out, is a very interesting idea, namely, that we should adopt a Constitutional Convention model and discharge this particular function to people fair and wise who are randomly chosen. The difficulty with that is the slippery slope it could open up. Let us say we hand over this power to these people for a period of time, what other powers might be worthy of handing over to such a body for other periods of time and for other purposes? What other roles do we think these people could perform?  That is where we get into the sanctity of the role of the Oireachtas and of Parliament. If a body is elected to carry out a particular role and to form judgments, surely we should give it proper legislative underpinning and the scope it needs. That is what this Bill will do. If a committee is formed to do that work, it will be difficult, as will the early days of that committee. There is absolutely no guarantee of success but the lack of guarantee of success should not be a reason not to try. Surely when people cast a vote for their Deputy, they do so in the reasonable expectation that he or she can make a judgment not only formed by political affiliation, but based on his or her own opinions and faculties.  I refer to a related issue, namely, the operation of the party Whip in the future. An area about which we will need to think carefully - this is very apparent to me - is that when such a committee is formed in the future, it should not be whipped by the party structure. If we are saying we want people to reasonably form conclusions in regard to particular events and so on, then it is important that Members of the Oireachtas are allowed to do so entirely devoid of any external pressure, whether the party Whip or otherwise. I strongly believe that it will be very difficult for that judgment to be exercised with the maintenance of that Whip. The passage of this Bill will allow the glorious reconciliation of Deputy Ross, the orator, and Deputy Ross, the inquisitor, in one function. If people are elected to carry out a particular function, we should see whether they can perform it and putting in place the best possible structure to allow that to happen is important. This Bill will provide the opportunity to do that and if passed, Members will rise to the occasion. 
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	402	I welcome the publication of this Bill. If we were to judge politics and politicians on grandstanding and playing to the gallery and the media, we would have no credibility but, thankfully, we do not all do that. There is a body of work in the Oireachtas which deserves to be analysed and respected. It behoves all politicians to remove the insincerity and not to play to the media and the gallery because it does not do the body politic any good at all. The Kenneth Starr inquiry into former US President Clinton went on forever and cost money. In the end, it found President Clinton had an affair. It did not require an august principled individual like Kenneth Starr to find that. The political culture dictates that we must be accountable and mature enough to be able to recognise that the body politic has a responsibility and a duty to cast aside vested interests and for people to declare their interests before they can do their job properly in the Oireachtas. That is why it is important that Members of the Oireachtas, as representatives of the people, are able to say that we can do our job and that we trust ourselves.  I understand from where Senator Ross is coming and, in many respects, I would not disagree with some of his comments. What was he was saying was that the body politic did not do itself or the people justice over the years, and he is right. However, it is important that Members of the Oireachtas restore the primacy of the Houses and that we re-establish their credibility.  This Bill is important and I trust politicians of all hues and irrespective of their ideology or beliefs to serve in the interests of the people who elected them. Our track record has been poor but are people really serious when they say they want to go down the road of another tribunal or a Kenneth Starr-type inquiry? The tribunal model is an expensive one as tribunals can go on indefinitely. If one sets a time limit, the chairperson asks for more time. We should be able to establish a committee, and I say that as someone who has no interest in serving on a committee inquiring into the banks. However, we have the expertise in the Houses of the Oireachtas, notwithstanding the points made by Deputy Ross, whose contribution I followed on my monitor.  At the heart of this Bill is the need to achieve accountability through investigations into key matters of national and public importance. That surely is the function of Members of the Oireachtas. I note the presence in the Chamber of Deputy Catherine Murphy, who serves with me on the Constitutional Convention. I pay tribute to her because she takes her duty and her role on the convention very seriously. It is an honour and a privilege for us to be asked to serve alongside our fellow citizens on the Constitutional Convention. In this case, similarly, I believe Members will put aside the party Whip, as Deputy Donohoe suggested, and choose instead to act and serve in the interests of democracy. That is made clear in the explanatory memorandum and the Minister referred to it in his speech. It is very important for us to be able to show we can act in this manner. I have seen a list of five things this Bill can achieve. There has been a mad rush to welcome the banking inquiry, but that should not be our only focus as we discuss this Bill. Other areas need to be analysed and investigated as well. We must not shrink from our responsibilities in that regard. We should not cast a sideways look. We must be holistic in our approach. The people deserve to know the full facts about the banks. It is important for us to hear that story. We will see what the outcome is when that story is told and answers are given. I will not pre-empt the inquiry. It is important for people to be held to account. All of us deserve to hear the full, unedited and unredacted story. When the people in their wisdom spoke in the 2011 referendum, as part of the democratic process, they decided they did not want the Bill we put to them. We are back with another Bill now. Deputy Mathews, who is in the Chair, and Deputy Mattie McGrath, who is also present in the Chamber, recently participated in three days of hearings in advance of the introduction of another Bill. Regardless of one's position on the issue being discussed, one will agree that the hearings were fair and that there was a balance in terms of the witnesses coming in. Respect and co-operation were evident in the running of the hearings.

They will not play to the media to get cheap headlines or be insincere in what they do. I have every confidence in the Members of this House and Seanad Éireann. We must trust ourselves, notwithstanding the criticisms of the past. If we look back all the time, we can never move forward. It is important that any proceedings are free from bias and that fair procedures are always adhered to. I welcome the compellability of witnesses because it is essential. We need to trust our legislators and ourselves. As politicians, we must prove that politics is an honourable profession. We must revisit that point. The majority of us are honourable and decent people. We are involved in politics to serve our people. As Teachtaí Dála, we are not here to get cheap headlines or to act insincerely. The primary purpose of this Bill is to create a legal and logistical framework for Oireachtas inquiries into matters of significant public importance. It can be done. It must be done because the people do not want a repeat of, for example, the 14-year Mahon tribunal, which cost approximately €100 million. That model is done. It is time for a new way of doing business. This can be achieved regardless of ideologies or party political positions.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	420	I am generally supportive of the extension of the inquiry powers of the Oireachtas as long as we have the correct parameters and safeguards. I was one of those who opposed the inquiries referendum. I made it clear at the time that I was not against inquiries by the Oireachtas. An all-party Oireachtas committee which had considered the question of inquiries in some detail had taken a great deal of time before proposing a wording that might be put forward. Essentially, the Government did not accept its recommendations and decided instead to put its own wording before the people. I felt that the wording recommended by the Government went way too far. I felt it crossed the line into an area that would more properly be dealt with the Judiciary. It was significantly more far-reaching than was necessary or would be in keeping with a democratic state. It is really important for us to retain the separation of powers. When the citizens of Ireland refused to adopt the Government's proposal on the day of the referendum, I do not think they were saying they had a difficulty with the holding of inquiries by the Oireachtas. I think they were saying they were concerned with what the wording enabled the Oireachtas to do. They might not necessarily have been concerned about the current Oireachtas, but they were conscious of the possibility of corruption of power by a future Oireachtas comprising different people. When people are asked to adopt something and place it in the Constitution, they know it will not be there for a short period. It has to stand the test of time. I regret that this Bill has been brought before the House so soon after its publication. I would have liked a little more time to give greater consideration to it. Unfortunately, this was a feature of the legislation that set up the inquiries referendum as well. We need to learn a lesson from that. We have to take our time over these matters because it is important to get them right. Questions need to be asked about why this legislation has been published before the Supreme Court has ruled on the Callely case. It is clear that elements of this legislation could and will be framed in that context. When the judgment is delivered, it may well bring about a significant change in what is intended. I ask the Government not to proceed with the Committee Stage debate on this Bill until the Supreme Court has delivered its findings.If we cannot put forward the Committee Stage changes, having had the benefit of that, we will potentially come back with amending legislation, which I do not consider in anybody's interest. I support the notion of a banking inquiry. However, there are very few Members of the House who have not compromised themselves in regard to such a banking inquiry when sitting on a committee. I have certainly given my views on the record as to what I thought about the banks. Yet, we are looking to assemble, from this Oireachtas, a group of neutral people who are suitably qualified to prepare a report. They will be difficult to find, certainly among those who were on the finance committee or the Committee of Public Accounts and who have the necessary competence. When one looks at the practicality of this, it will be difficult to achieve. It is very important that we understand what happened in 2008, in particular with regard to the people who lobbied and all the rest, because if we do understand that, we cannot learn from it. However, this will be no substitute for what should rightfully take place in the courts. It has taken far too long to get to a point where people can be prosecuted through the courts and where the course of action that should happen through that process can happen. I would like to hear how we can have a banking inquiry, given the safeguards in the Bill. While we have had a lot of debate on this for several years, how we can construct a committee that would be deemed to be not biased in terms of Members having taken a position? Clearly, there are aspects of the Bill that are safeguards. We all know that perception is reality in terms of somebody's good name. Where there are not findings of fact, there are findings of implication or there is the possibility of that. There will have to be great safeguards as to what exactly will be inquired into, and I know a process is included in the Bill in this regard. One could find that a list of things are deemed to be of public interest but, on examination, they are populist rather than in the public interest. It is important that this section of the Bill is got right, which will require detailed consideration on Committee Stage. In the absence of the report on the Callely case, we have no idea what sanctions are available to the Oireachtas. This is the kind of issue that will require detailed consideration on Committee Stage and it is why it is essential we do not proceed beyond Second Stage before the Supreme Court has ruled. I understand there is to be a panel of legal experts and there will be a tendering process, which is good. However, we all know it will require much more in terms of the resourcing of this kind of committee. If we are going to set up a committee, there will have to be a commitment that it will be properly resourced so it will function properly. In Part 2 of the Bill, section 7 deals with new legislation the committee may suggest is required. One obvious point is that there is an in-built Government majority on all of the committees. That is not very different from what happens at present, where the Government decides what legislation is taken, and pretty much everything that comes from the Opposition, while it might get a hearing on a Friday morning or in Private Members' time, does not get any further along. This needs consideration in terms of how we might get a balance on the committee. A strict reflection of the make-up of the Dáil may not be in order in this case. During the lifetime of this Government we have seen plenty of evidence of abuse of process. For example, we have seen guillotines being used routinely and legislation being published very late. The Companies Bill was the size of a telephone book, yet we got it one week before it was due to be debated. Next week, we will debate both the social welfare Bill, which is not yet published, and the Croke Park II legislation, which we have not seen yet. When I see that type of abuse of process, and we are conferring on ourselves the right to have inquiries, it does not fill me with confidence. I would like it noted that the behaviour of a very large Government can be an issue of mistrust where power is used to ram business through very quickly. As an example, the promissory note night debate was a cause of great concern. Part 12 of the Bill deals with the oath. While I may be misreading the Bill, I cannot find a provision for a non-religious oath or its equivalent. I would like to see this included as it is only right and proper that it would be. It is certainly available in the courts and is a more inclusive way to proceed. The Constitution provides that the Oireachtas can make its own Standing Orders. In reality, however, the only Standing Orders that are changed are the ones the Government wants to change because, again, a majority decision is used. Even very small changes are not acceded to. For example, the Technical Group has been seeking a change in order that a nominated person from our group can speak on the Order of Business. However, unless one is a party leader, that is not provided for, even if no one is available to speak. This is the case even though the Technical Group makes up one third of the Opposition. We are being asked to adopt this in the context of a Government with a very large majority. I have concerns in regard to section 8, which deals with the power to inquire into the removal of certain officeholders, such as the President, a judge or the Comptroller and Auditor General. Again, this is something we will have to give the gravest of consideration. I am not sure it is a power that should be conferred on this committee because there should be a balance of input from all sides of the House in an equal way. Those are the main points I wish to make. I do not have a principled objection to the legislation and, while there are problematic issues, some of those can be dealt with on Committee Stage. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of waiting until the Supreme Court rules in the Callely case. I also have concerns about the balance and make-up of the committee.

I welcome the Bill because it provides clarity in the area of Oireachtas inquiries and consolidates existing legislation within the constitutional framework as set out in the Abbeylara judgment. It is important to note that this Bill is not attempting to interfere with the outcome of the proposed 13th amendment to the Constitution, which was defeated by the referendum in 2011. Instead, it aims to ensure that Oireachtas inquiries can carry out important work in certain areas such as the proposed and much called for banking inquiry. I want to focus on section 18 of the Bill. I ask the Minister to consider carefully this section which prohibits a Member of the House from sitting on a committee where a perception of bias might arise in a reasonable person. In a RTE Radio 1 interview, Paul Anthony McDermott highlighted that this section could be a possible source of legal challenge to an inquiry. Section 18 aims to ensure non-bias on the part of the committee of inquiry and provides that a Member of the Oireachtas may not sit on a committee of inquiry where his or her connections or dealings with the subject matter of the inquiry, public utterances on the matter or any other circumstances the House considers relevant mean that a perception of bias might arise in a reasonable person aware of that connection or those dealings or utterances. Mr. McDermott envisaged that there could be legal challenges during the course of a practical application of this section. Utterances can be defined as the action of saying or expressing something aloud. Who has not made a comment or a public utterance on the banking crisis, particularly in this age of social media? Would a Twitter comment be sufficient for a committee member to be deemed biased? Many politicians have made many comments about banks and the banking crisis and some have made a virtue out of bank bashing. Does that mean that many of us will not be able to sit on an Oireachtas committee of inquiry? However, I recognise the intent in this section because there are some people who should not sit on Oireachtas committees set up to investigate particular matters. The instance that springs to mind today is the issue relating to the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts of public funds spend on ministerial offices in light of the €250,000 spend in 2007 on an office fit out and refurbishment for the then Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness. The Committee of Public Accounts has agreed to look at the fit-out and refurbishment costs of all ministerial offices. When the figure of €250,000 appeared in the public domain, I called for the committee to carry out an investigation of this exorbitant expenditure and I am very pleased that it is now doing so. Deputy McGuinness, the Chairman of the committee, has said that he has nothing to hide and he wants the entire matter investigated and he is to be commended for this. However, this is a very clear example of why a Member of the House shall not be or continue to be a committee member if for any reason, his or her connection or dealing with any matter is the subject of the inquiry. In this particular instance, I am now calling on Deputy McGuinness to step down as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts while this investigation is underway. Section 18 is a very important part of the Bill and will require further examination and consideration. We also need to view this Bill in light of the impending judgment in the Callely case as the decision will no doubt shed further light in this area. Finally, I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	423	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. We as public representatives are constantly asked by our constituents why people or institutions whose actions damage the welfare of the State are not brought to account. In most other democratic states, the houses of parliament have the power of inquiry. These inquiries in other countries are a very cost-effective way of holding inquiries. They challenge official and public representatives, former politicians and state and semi-state agencies. Their parliamentary committees have the power to summon witnesses, make determinations and call to account any persons accused of wrongdoing. In the Abbeylara judgment, it quickly became obvious that this could not happen here. The Irish Constitution lacked a specific provision for the holding of parliamentary inquiries. As a result of the Abbeylara judgment, when an issue needs to be examined, it must be dealt with by a sworn public inquiry. These inquiries are hugely expensive for the taxpayer and so legally complex that they seldom produce clear results, as we have learned in the past. This Government considered the huge cost to the taxpayer of such inquiries and their inadequate outcomes. We decided to ask the people in a referendum to give the Houses of the Oireachtas power to carry out such inquiries in a similar way to that done in other countries. However, the people chose not to endorse the Government's attempt to change the Constitution to facilitate such inquiries. The Government has now looked at introducing this Bill. This Bill will hopefully allow the Government to hold meaningful inquiries within the limits of the Constitution. Inquiries to be held under this Bill are still limited in value. This respects the Supreme Court's decision and the recent decision of the people. There seems to be a contradiction between the people's decision not to change the Constitution and their continuing demand for inquiries. In particular, we hear calls for a banking inquiry. Despite the best intentions of this Government in introducing this Bill, the actions of any inquiry will be subject to challenge under the Constitution. I believe a multiplicity of legal challenges will greatly reduce the effectiveness of this Bill. We as lawmakers must try to establish the most effective way of dealing with this. The Minister is to be complimented for the way he is dealing with this comprehensive and complicated legislation. Initially, the heads of the Bill were forwarded to the relevant Oireachtas committees for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform was briefed by officials from the Department. The committee decided to invite the public to submit observations. Many submissions were received, which the House must now consider. Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin have made detailed submissions. The Labour Party as a partner in government has also contributed to this debate. Opinions from all sides are more than welcome. In order for this Bill to be successful, it must be examined carefully at every stage of its progress through the Dáil and Seanad. It must respect the will of the people and the Constitution. At the same time, it must create a process that will satisfy the unquestionable will of the people. They want to have the issues that seriously affect their daily lives examined. The Irish people want to see the people who destroyed the banking system and caused the loss of our economic independence through their mistakes and incompetence brought to account. We will suffer from this for many years. This legislation should form the basis for a banking inquiry. Any inquiry will be limited due to constitutional restraints and the Supreme Court decision in the Abbeylara case. An inquiry will not be able to attribute blame or guilt to persons before it but calling witnesses, examining the processes used and issuing a detailed report will help. The general public will be able to draw its own conclusions. If politicians act responsibly in this manner and carry out inquiries effectively, at a later date, the electorate might reconsider its recent decision on the constitutional amendment. This would allow for a more effective system of inquiry as happens in many other countries. This Bill will provide for fairness in the process and clarity. It underpins any of the five proposed inquiry models and provides a set of rules and procedures to ensure they do not fall foul of the Constitution. It is important to note that this legislation does not allow for findings to be made against ordinary members of the public. Only high ranking individuals will be regarded as accountable to the Dáil. The Bill also introduces rules to limit legal costs. I have no doubt that this will prove difficult. A panel of cost accountants will be in place and there will be an adjudication process to decide if costs are applicable. I have no doubt that outcomes from these inquiries will have various degrees of success or failure, particularly considering the constitutional restrictions the Minister is working under. This Bill goes as far as is legally possible. Hopefully, it will produce the answers the people are demanding. I commend this Bill to the House.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	424	This Bill aims to develop a comprehensive statutory framework for the conduct of inquiries by the Oireachtas. It arises as a result of the Abbeylara judgment, the rejected 2011 referendum and surrounding commentary, a report by the Committee of Public Accounts on the preliminary framework for the Oireachtas inquiry into the domestic banking crisis, as well as the Callely case which awaits a Supreme Court judgment. The Bill will replace and update existing legislation to provide a system for the establishment and administration of Oireachtas inquiries together with related matters regarding private parliamentary papers and privileges. It provides for five general types of Oireachtas inquiries, namely, an inquiry to record and report with regard to any specific issue which can make findings of uncontested fact and draw attention to matters in dispute; a legislative inquiry into any matter which could be legislated for by the Oireachtas; an inquiry relating to the removal of an office holder, such as under Article 12.10, impeachment of the President, under Article 33.5, removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General, or under Article 35, a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court; an inquiry relating to conduct of a Member of the House in his or her capacity as a Member; and an inquiry to hold the Government to account and also to hold to account any person liable to Dáil scrutiny by contract or statutory appointment. The Government objective is to clarify and consolidate the circumstances under which the Oireachtas may conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework as set down by the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case. This extensive and lengthy Bill repeals almost all existing legislation in the area and consolidates these and new provisions into one piece of legislation. The Bill is divided into Parts, including preliminary and general provisions, types of inquiry, fair procedures of inquiries, reports of inquiries and related confidential documents, legal costs and expenses, compellability, privileges and immunities relating to other Oireachtas committee business, privilege and immunity for Oireachtas Members and committees, restriction of evidence of certain persons, applications to the High Court, privilege relating to private papers and confidential communications concerning Oireachtas Members, privileges relating to official documents, evidence on oath, the laying of documents and miscellaneous provisions. Most offences under the Bill relate to refusal to co-operate, withholding of evidence and attempt to subvert an inquiry, such as by intimidation and bribery. Offences under the Act are punished as follows: on a summary non-jury conviction of a class A fine, up to €5,000 or imprisonment for up to six months or both; on conviction on indictment to a fine of up to €500,000 or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. One of the principal challenges in any attempt at reform of the law relating to public inquiries is that while such inquiries are not a court of law, they frequently and very publicly delve into allegations of wrongdoing which, even if not leading to any kind of civil or criminal liability, can irreparably damage the good name of an individual. The Abbeylara inquiry was found to have contravened two constitutional principles of fair procedure. The Bill provides the necessary detailed legislative framework for the Houses of the Oireachtas to conduct a possible banking inquiry. Therefore, it is important that the Bill passes all Stages before the summer recess.

This legislation has been rushed. It has a nice title but there is little else in it. Like other speakers I am concerned. I was a Member of the previous Dáil and I saw the Government when in opposition objecting on a regular basis - often with good reason - to the use of guillotines. However, the Government has excelled itself with guillotines since it came to office. A referendum on this issue was conducted last year. Many people on this side of the House, especially on the Independent benches, were given no credit by the media when they pointed out that the proposal was flawed and fraught with dangers. It was ultimately rejected by the people and rightly so, in my view, because it was a rushed proposal. This Government has become a little punch-drunk because of the size of its majority. I said this to the Taoiseach. The Government thinks it is infallible: its members have been carried away by the massive mandate from the people. I am not in favour of tribunals which cost a fortune. I contrast the tribunals with the report on the Magdalen laundries by former Senator Martin McAleese, which cost €11,000, a paltry sum for an excellent job done in quick time with a lot of hard work and engagement. Nothing has happened as a result of the Mahon tribunal and other tribunals. They were only talking shops, making even fatter fat cats out of the barristers from the law courts. I am in favour of a banking inquiry. It beggars belief that five years on, we have not had such an inquiry. I will not be eligible to sit on the committee because I have been loud in my condemnation of what happened with the bankers, the gangsters, the chancers and also the regulators. Secretaries General and others were sent off to Europe afterwards. I know I should not mention Mr. Cardiff. People had to be sent off because of what they knew. The regulator was asleep at the wheel. These people allowed our country to be plundered and literally destroyed - I could use stronger words - and the problem was put onto the people who have to pay for everything. I met a group from Permanent TSB before I came to the Chamber. These people took early retirement packages which are now worthless, having been unilaterally cut by between 48% and 58% by the end of this month. This is how the ordinary people are being treated, including the ordinary front-line bank workers who did no harm to anybody. They did their job and they were not responsible. The chief executive officer of that same bank is earning €400,000 and not a penny reduction in salary. It is time we had some real political accountability. The House needs to treat this issue seriously, not to be like Deputy Heather Humphreys who has read out a statement from the Fine Gael press office attacking Deputy John McGuinness. I would expect Deputy McGuinness to stand aside if there were to be an investigation into aspects of his involvement. He is an honourable man and I would not expect any less from him. He would not have to be told by some of the Fine Gael backbenchers to do that. I lived through the night of the bank guarantee. We were summoned to Dublin and told if we did not vote for this bank guarantee the roof would fall in on the country and there would be no money in the ATMs and most, if not all, credit unions would go broke. We did not know what to do. We voted for it to avoid the abyss. Foolishly, I voted for it, on the lies that were told to the then Deputy Brian Lenihan and the lies are still being told to this Government, nothing short of lies-----

I will not repeat it. I have said it often enough. I lived through it again on the night of the promissory notes. It was the same all-night saga about legislation that had been drafted six months previously. We are being fed and led by official Ireland not respecting the people who were elected democratically. I accept I am only one of those for the time being. We are being said and led by officialdom and by this committee and that committee. I had a discussion this morning with some committee I never heard of. I was accompanied by Deputy Stephen Donnelly who is not here because he is not well. If he were here I could find out about this committee which is in between the Minister for Finance and these banking people. It is a prestigious committee. The former Taoiseach, John Bruton, whom I respect, is chair of this committee and that gives me some confidence. There are too many of these unelected quangos dictating what happens and what happens in here is irrelevant. We are an irrelevant little irritant sometimes. That is why the banking inquiry has not been held because powerful people do not want it to be held. It must be held but I do not know what committee will deal with it. We should take a leaf out of the book of the public accounts committee over the water and the MP - I cannot think of her name - who put Google over the ropes.Deputy Murphy referred to the Companies Bill which has been in gestation for 20 years. When it was finally published, I did not get a copy because I was told it was too large to print. It has over 1,400 pages and costs €102 to purchase. Who can afford that or would be interested? As I said when I heard, one could buy ten of Deputy Ross's novels for that. If the Acting Chairman, Deputy Mathews, ever writes one, it will not be that expensive and we will all buy it. Who wants to read 1,400 pages? It is only an effort to convolute and keep people confused.

Some would say it is a crisis. From financial crisis and democratic deficit to failing and crippling austerity measures, it is obvious that things must change rapidly for the benefit of the Union and, more important, its citizens. The decision to create a single currency was viewed by many across the political spectrum as an ideological and political decision to accelerate the move towards federalism within the EU. There was not a great deal of debate on the economic and social ramifications of the creation of the euro. There was no popular demand for a single currency and no frank and open discussion with citizens took place on its creation. It was not promoted to serve and benefit average citizens. It was a decision and project supported and promoted by elites for the benefit of elites. The euro area jobless rate rose to a record level in March, growing over 12%. There are now 19.2 million unemployed people across the eurozone while youth unemployment is at a staggering 24%. The euro has been a factor in creating the crisis in Ireland and Europe. Cheap credit from the ECB facilitated reckless banking and lending and a property bubble that brought the State to its financial knees. We were told our hands were tied in responding to the impending financial crisis as we lacked fiscal autonomy and could not devalue or inflate our own currency. However, the euro is not the sole cause of the financial crisis we face today. Countries outside the EU have also suffered recession and crisis in the last few years. Sinn Féin agrees with many that it would not be in Ireland's interest to leave the euro as we are far too embedded within the European and global financial system to make such a radical move. The euro and EU can still help Ireland to get out of this crisis, but it will require a radical change of policy. The EU's response to the crisis has been to focus on austerity, the socialisation of private debt and neoliberal economics. This has fuelled the increase in unemployment, poverty, personal indebtedness, homelessness and emigration, as we have witnessed on a daily basis. Instead of austerity, the EU requires an investment programme and a social insurance fund for countries struggling under the current crisis. The European Investment Bank must lead a physical and intellectual infrastructure development programme to improve Europe's competitiveness, create jobs and stimulate growth across Europe. Once employment has been stimulated, Governments will see an upturn in revenue which will inevitably lead to and promote a further lowering in social welfare payments and a decline in national deficits. eurozone countries should not be led down the route of stronger fiscal and monetary union underpinned by austerity, which would commit Governments to a further cycle of deficits. In a truly democratic fiscal union, member states suffering lower economic yields would receive transfers from wealthier economic states. Wealth and supports could be distributed in a more even-handed way but to avail of this member states would have to accept fiscal decisions on taxation and spending being made collectively for the most part. Serious and meaningful work to transform the EU and shape it in the interests of all its citizens can begin in the upcoming EU budget negotiations. If the proposed budget is cut as suggested, it will be the first time in 56 years that such a thing has happened. The European Parliament rightly opposes the last proposed budget. The EU is facing its worst economic crisis since its creation and 90% of the budget is destined for investment in social and economic programmes in member states. The financial crisis needs investment-led growth not austerity failure.

I am not talking about the graphics. When Ireland joined the euro, it gained a currency it had no power to inflate or devalue. Intrinsically, that meant we lost sovereignty over our currency due to the flawed design of the euro. However, we must deal with the reality of our situation. All of our debt is denominated in euros which means the euro and Europe still hold the key to solving the current crisis. There are a number of actions which must happen if we are to find a way out of the mire. I will go into greater detail later in my contribution but note for now that such actions must include investment, debt write-down, the fulfilment by the ESM of its role and the ECB becoming a lender of last resort. While the euro was certainly a contributing cause of the crisis, it was not its sole cause. The United States of America, Britain and Iceland all went into recession at the same time as Ireland and none of those countries is in eurozone. Like Ireland, those countries were hit by a crisis in the financial sector which had a knock-on effect on the finances of the State. Ireland and Europe generally need an investment programme to kickstart the economy. History shows that investment is necessary to get economies back on their feet. After the Second World War, Britain was virtually bankrupt, Germany had been reduced to ruins and large parts of Europe lay in a state of disrepair. European economies were on their knees. As a result, the Marshall plan was formulated and funding was pumped into European economies. Before long, those economies were booming once again. The European Investment Bank must learn the lessons of history to improve GDP across Europe. As GDP grows, debt will automatically decline as measured against it. A write-down of toxic debt is simply a must if we are to find a way out of the crisis. Last year's austerity treaty attempted to enshrine public bailouts of private debt in law. The Cyprus crisis demonstrated that policy in Europe is only as firm as the latest application for a bailout.The current policy pursued at European level seems to be haphazard and without joined-up thinking. At the heart of the eurozone crisis is the inability of some member states to repay their debts. Action must be taken in Europe to write down the toxic debt inhibiting economic recovery. The ESM must fulfil its role to recapitalise the banks so that states do not have to. This was agreed in the June 2012 summit, where it was agreed to separate sovereign debt from banking debt. However, when the crisis in Cyprus hit, the ESM failed to act. If there is to be a functioning euro, the ECB needs to act like a proper central bank. It needs to become the real lender of last resort. There was no lender of last resort for the euro and so international markets began to increase their yield for buying sovereign bonds when the crisis hit. This created a vicious cycle, whereby it became impossible for countries to borrow from the markets, leading them to seek bailouts. We should not make moves to pull out of the euro but we need to recognise the serious flaws the currency has. At a European level, Ireland needs to put pressure on the European authorities to have currency reform. If this was done, it would truly be a major result for the Irish Presidency of the EU, the Irish people and the people of Europe.

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this motion. I wish to focus specifically on the proposal that any treaty changes should include a process that allows a eurozone member state to voluntarily leave the eurozone. It is not in Ireland’s interest to exit the eurozone. The country has benefited hugely from membership of the EU and I doubt any Member of the House could stand up and say Ireland has not benefited from full EU membership. In our early years as part of the euro, we benefited significanty in economic terms and we continue to be a net beneficiary of the EU. It would be worth putting time and effort into looking at some of the issues raised and thoroughly researching and analysing the impact so that we can make informed decisions but this motion is sadly lacking in-depth analysis on the impact of leaving the euro. Instead, it is proposing that we can just leave if we want to. I was working in the international division of a bank when we broke the link with sterling. This was heralded as a great advancement for our country but I subsequently saw at first hand the struggles and difficulties that Ireland faced as a result. Throughout the 1980s, Ireland suffered economic stagnation while most of Europe experienced growth. Our Irish punt was battered by the speculators, interest rates rose over 20% and the country was crippled. The Central Bank had to step in on numerous occasions to prop up the punt at huge cost to the Exchequer. Small nations such as ours are at the mercy of powerful speculators and their actions can cause significant fluctuations in a currency, bring uncertainty and make doing international business very difficult. Despite its being dead and gone, we all remember the Celtic tiger, from which we all benefited. Our rapid growth initially can be attributed to a boom in exports thanks to the single currency. The motion is proposing that we go backwards so I want to ask where should we start. Should we return to sterling or go back even further to bartering? The motion is ill-prepared and not at a point of development where it warrants a serious debate. There are no projections or figures to clearly outline the implication of an exit from the euro. For example, what about the physical costs involved in switching back to the old Irish punt? As a member state of the EU, we are obliged to allow free movement of capital throughout Europe. A new currency could well cause panic and most likely speculation that could lead to a run on our banks, with many people wishing to keep their funds in a currency in which they have confidence. Multinationals may view Ireland out of the euro as too high a risk and may decide to move elsewhere. The motion is not properly thought out, with no account taken of the consequences.

One can see the differing opinions, which are very important, in the amendments from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. Sadly, the Technical Group's differences come out in the motion in that it does not say what it wants to achieve for Ireland or for the euro. Given the mix of people in the Technical Group, it is understandable. This is an important debate, particularly in respect of democratic legitimacy. We have a directly elected European Parliament and the Heads of Government take proposals from the Commission, which is not elected. The Fine Gael Party and its governing body in the European People's Party believes the President of the Commission should be democratically elected. Sometimes we overstate the degree to which technocrats rule Europe. Proposals still come before the democratically elected Heads of Government. In the case of the multi-annual financial framework, it also comes before the European Parliament. One could not but agree with many of the aspirations in the amendments. Europe and the euro have flaws and failings but we must ask where we would be if we had remained an isolated, small island, with an independent currency, off one of the largest economic blocs on the planet. Many of the problems in this country over the past five or six years were self-inflicted. To blame Europe and the euro is a step too far. It is correct to say we are now in it and it is equally correct to say the main problem of the euro is caused by the fact it does not have supports such as banking union and a properly functioning central bank. The solution is to improve those institutions and develop our shared currency. It is the currency of the Irish people, just as Ireland cannot step in or out of being a member of Europe. We are part of Europe, the same as everyone else. While the debate and discussion on the future of Europe is welcome, it should be approached from the point of view of how we can improve our currency rather than the overly simplistic view, which is detrimental to the country, the economy and Europe, of simply walking away from a currency that has so much potential.

No other party, not even Sinn Féin, wants to get rid of the euro. Much of what Sinn Féin included in the motion is sensible although some of its members' contributions were way off. An example is considering a new currency. Deflating a currency is a sign of failure and is not something any economy should examine. Eventually, such action catches up with the country. The motion seems to refer to the speech of President Barroso. His speech on the matter refers to starting and fuelling a democratic debate with the European Parliament, members of national parliaments, governments, academics, and essentially everyone in Europe. He said that a truly European public debate is necessary to underpin the intensified political union that is a key complement to fiscal and economic integration and that Europe's democratic legitimacy and accountability must keep pace with its increased role and power. What he is saying is what the Sinn Féin Members are calling for. He also said the crisis of the euro was not an economic and fiscal crisis in individual countries. It was not the euro itself that was a problem but what happened in each of the countries. The euro remains a strong currency. In Ireland, we had a construction bubble and we were spending beyond our means.

The motion refers to draconian fiscal rules but every household must learn to within live within its means. That is essentially what we are talking about in much of the crisis talk.If one reads any of the debates in this House, in the committees and in the public media, one can see that everybody accepts that the first thing we had to do was stabilise our economy and ensure our public spending was controlled. One can spend one's way into bankruptcy and there was no point in this country doing that. Many of the issues the Members refer to in the context of austerity have become part not just of the national discussion here but also the European discussion. The Members opposite are like the British Tories in some respects in that they are falling into the old habit of blaming Europe for all of their problems. However, many of the issues that must be resolved in this country are home-grown problems. We must dealt with them first. In fact, Europe is becoming increasingly democratic in many respects. Europe has saved us from our worst excesses. Without having had the opportunity of the bailout programme and the changes that are taking place, which we strongly support, we would be in a worse crisis. This motion is ill-thought out and many of the charges made by its supporters are wrong. In fact, many of the actions they say we should take are the same as those proposed by President Barroso, the person of whom they are so critical.

There have been many brokered agreements on a wide range of issues, but I will focus on health. The major success recently was the eHealth Week programme. It was focused on innovative and sustainable health systems for the future. Ireland also hosted the EU-US eHealth Marketplace conference to promote the European e-health agenda. The matchmaking event was designed to encourage collaboration between European and US companies, health providers and other stakeholders involved in the European Connected Health Alliance. It was during this conference that the EU health Ministers agreed a declaration on e-health presented by the Irish Presidency. The declaration is aimed at prioritising the use of ICT in health among member states and to contribute to better, safer, sustainable and innovative health care systems for all European citizens. An e-health action plan was launched. The development of an e-health ecosystem will result not only in better health outcomes for our citizens but will also bring economic benefits through the development of new technologies and, more importantly, increased employment opportunities. The agreement of this declaration demonstrates our collective commitment to making e-health systems a reality as we continue a process of reform of our health system and the systems across Europe. The objective of an e-health system is to promote private and public sector innovation on a co-operative basis, ensuring a vibrant economy for the deployment of e-health applications. As part of the declaration we agreed to strengthen co-ordination of all policies relating to e-health; to promoting a system that has dialogue aimed at mutual learning and a sharing of good experiences between industry, academia, patients, citizens and the health services of Europe; to accelerate the implementation of existing and proven devices and processes; to create an innovative market; and to ensure that citizens receive optimum outcomes in a shorter timeframe by delivering on existing priorities. To conclude, Ireland has used its Presidency to help create dialogue and communication between EU citizens and the EU and its leaders. In doing so, our Presidency has made significant and lasting strides in the drive to help build a healthier Europe.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	441	I am happy to respond to the motion. Specifically, I am glad to have the opportunity to nail some of the myths and distortions that have grown about Europe, generated by a bizarre collection of populists, fantasists and conspiracy theorists across the Continent and in this country. If ever I begin to doubt my position on Europe, I take a quick look around the Continent and listen to those who are most opposed to European participation. In France, there is the obnoxious, far right bile of people such as Jean-Marie Le Pen. In Italy there are the failed remnants of the old Stalinist communists and, closer to home, there is the frankly bizarre pomposity of the UK Independence Party. It never fails to cheer me up that Sinn Féin, for example, appears to see no irony in sharing the delusional, narrow-minded views of little Englanders from Tunbridge Wells. I firmly believe that Europe has been, and will continue to be, good for Ireland. The notion that we have no say in Europe is ludicrous, particularly now as we draw near the end of a very successful six month Presidency of the European Union. During that time we secured the youth guarantee, which has ring-fenced €6 billion specifically to tackle youth unemployment in some of the worst affected areas of the European Union. We tore up barriers to employment while so-called socialist parties, which tell us they are interested in work, were busy tearing up forms. We also made progress on the development of the digital single market, a crucial area for Ireland in view of the number of high-tech companies located here. This development will dovetail with the roll-out of high speed broadband across the country, which was announced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, last week. Trade negotiations continued with Asia and Africa, key emerging markets for the Irish economy and for Irish companies and jobs. We reached agreement on two key components of a banking union package which will help to prevent banking crises in the future. We protected Ireland's interests in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy and fisheries reforms. That is not a bad four and a half months by any stretch of the imagination for a country which, according to some Members of the Opposition, has no say in Europe. There is still another six weeks to achieve more significant measures for the Irish people and the European Union. Let us not forget that almost every job created in Ireland over the last five years has been a direct result of our role in Europe, be it through multinationals attracted by our membership of the eurozone or the successful exports of our agri-food industry. I am proud of Ireland's participation in Europe, and I am proud of what Ireland brings to Europe. Yes, there are problems sometimes, as we all know, and these problems continue to be addressed. However, Ireland's place is unmistakably at the heart of Europe, as a strong and equal partner with 26 colleague nations. We will not be left on the frozen wastelands of the periphery, politically and in every respect, that is occupied by the UK, the UK Independence Party, Sinn Féin, unfortunately, and some other Independent Members of this House, who would prefer us to have a much more distant relationship with Europe than we currently enjoy and need.

I cannot go into great detail in three minutes but all sides in this debate, particularly the pro-European parties in the House, recognise that there have been strengths and weaknesses in the European model. During the time of growth and plenty here and in Europe during the last decade nobody was calling for the scrapping of the eurozone or the single currency. Now that there is a downturn and a crisis, it is a different story. All of our problems are being blamed on Europe. It is good to have this debate. By all means we should eliminate the weaknesses of the European model and get rid of the unnecessary regulations. However, we should also build on the strengths and the potential that Europe has delivered and will continue to deliver. Despite the recessions and financial crises, Europe has contributed hugely to the economic development of this country since we joined the then EEC in 1973. There are very romantic memories of Ireland in the pre-EEC days, of maidens dancing at the crossroads and so forth.

Regardless of what test one applies, there have been improvements. It should also be remembered that our European partners stood by us in the current crisis. We can complain about the strings that were attached and we will all wave a very pleasant goodbye to the troika, but we are in a better place now, despite the crisis, than the position we were in three or four years ago. With regard to the banking union and the need to monitor the budgets of member states, perhaps if we had been more closely monitored from 2000 to 2010, we would not be in the current crisis. In some respects, we should welcome some of that monitoring. I congratulate the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and all the Ministers who have been active under the Irish Presidency, with the result that Ireland has restored for itself considerable credibility on the international stage.

The scepticism remains the same. The signatories makes strange bedfellows. While they can quote statistics and talk about processes, per capita income, etc., they should note that Irish income per capita is the highest, apart from that of Luxembourg. The Deputies opposite have spoken about crisis. We have heard clichés and megaphones and everything that comes with them. If one considers how much we have progressed, and not only in terms of sovereignty, one realises that we have benefited enormously from being part of a strong union and eurozone. The Deputies refer to a crisis but this country was in crisis, just like Greece, Portugal and others. The eurozone is not in crisis. It is strong and the countries that constitute it have the ability to work with a strong currency. Banking union is required to copper-fasten the eurozone's future. We now have a more democratic Europe. People forget that we have democratically elected MEPs and co-decision-making. The Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy are in trilogue, involving our Minister in the European Council, MEPs and the European Commission. We have benefited.  Like myself, Deputy Pringle, a signatory of the motion, is from a fishing town. He would not be too quick to fly the flag for Europe in towns such as Killybegs or Castletownbere. The benefits are forgotten in the motion. Our towns represent a good microcosm. Before the European Union, most of the exports from our two towns went to Billingsgate and not much farther, and the exporters got nothing for them. They are now going to the Union, for prices that result in a sustainable industry. While it is not perfect, one must realise we are almost three quarters of the way across the river. This motion proposes that we turn back. I fundamentally disagree with that approach. Social and financial legislation and regulation, which we have not had in this country but which we will see coming from the Union, will ensure a stronger, better economy not only for us, but for the Union as a whole. I do not agree with the motion, as tabled.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	446	There is clearly much to improve in the European Union. Although we are slowly moving towards a more democratic set of circumstances, there is a lot of work to be done in terms of banking union, etc. Overall, however, the European Union has been good for Ireland and every other member, including France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. We need one another. We live in a world in which the individual nation state is much too small to stand on its own, unless it is one such as India. We are far better if we work together. We come from the same cultural background considering our Christian and social heritage. Therefore, there is no reason we should not work together. I want to use my few minutes to appeal to the people of Britain to wake up and have sense with regard to their attitude to the European Union. The Union is where it is at nowadays. Eight of Britain's ten major trading partners are from the European Union. The only two that are non-EU countries are the United States and China. Although the United States is so much bigger than Germany, it is not really very far ahead of it in terms of Britain's trade with it. Approximately two weeks ago, with other Members of the Oireachtas I met Members of the British Parliament. They had serious concerns about the direction of Britain. It is really important for both them and us that they hang in and that we use every opportunity to encourage the United Kingdom to stay with us and work with us. It is not in our interest for it to leave the Union, and it is certainly not in its interest. I hope that after the UKIP is exposed as being foolish in terms of politics, the United Kingdom will take stock and realise that its best interests lie with the Union.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	447	I too am pro-European. The European Union is good for us as European citizens. With the protections and benefits it offers us, we are all better off as workers, travellers, women and students. There is almost no area of life that has not benefited from or been enhanced by the rights and privileges that have flown to us from Europe over the years. That is not to mention the improvement in our infrastructure owing to EU funding and the funds that still flow to us to allow banks to open every morning. However, I am not slavishly blind to the Union's faults, nor am I unaware that the institution is not perfect. I do agree that a debate is needed on what we expect from the Union and what we are willing to give back to it. Further integration will be necessary. We need to bring the public with us. There is a disconnection and some disaffection with Europe. However, this is at least partly due to us, as politicians. Over the years, it has suited us to blame the Union for every decision we did not like, without making any effort to explain the rationale behind those decisions, either the long-term benefits or the widespread gains that would ultimately accrue. Over the years, we have sent Ministers to Europe to "fight" for us. Even the media uses the expression "fight" as if there were somebody against us. It has suited us at times to have faceless figures of oppression and bureaucracy to blame for our woes when, in fact, the Union is no more than 27 equally flawed and equally angst-ridden countries, all scrambling to do the best they can for their citizens and for us all collectively. The best analogy is the resemblances and suspicion that exist between Dublin and the remaining counties. The tortured and slightly schizophrenic relationship between urban and rural areas in Ireland does not blind us to the fact that we are all part of a single entity that is interdependent and mutually sustaining. It is precisely that love-hate relationship we have with Europe, despite all its warts, that makes us realise we must face up to dealing with those warts. We must be part of the debate and try to mould the Union such that it can meet what are undoubtedly the challenges of the 21st century. It is true that, in setting up the eurozone, some regime should have been put in place to allow countries to exit. However, to pretend we can now leave the eurozone and go it alone, such that all our problems will be solved, is to forget that we did once go it alone, print our own money and allow our currencies to float. I have very few happy memories of those years. Anybody who lived through those years will realise it is easy now to blame Brussels or Germany for the crushing blow caused by the burden of the link between bank and sovereign debt, but this burden was not placed on us by the Union. We opted for it two full years before the troika ever turned up. We opted for that when we gave the guarantee. Rewriting history and engaging in a xenophobic fantasy about a better Ireland and going it alone on a rock on the edge of the Atlantic is not just unrealistic, but also dangerous and seditious. It undermines our own self-confidence and the confidence of others in us. If we care about this country and our children's future, we should strive to shape the new Europe and not fight it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	448	I am sharing time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Shane Ross, Seamus Healy and Tom Fleming. I wish to comment on the irony of Deputy Nash's contribution, which referred to Stalinists being opposed to the European Union.I remind him that the most prominent former Stalinists in this Parliament are now leading the party of which he is a member. Maybe it is a telling fact that the current leadership of the Labour Party, in their previous incarnation as the Workers' Party, had a slavish commitment to the centralised, totalitarian and undemocratic regimes in Eastern Europe and made regular pilgrimages to Eastern Europe, North Korea and China to kneel before the supposed glories of communism which we all know was a brutal, totalitarian abomination. It seems since their faith in those horrific regimes has collapsed, their belief that there is any alternative to tooth and claw capitalism has collapsed along with it.  Maybe there is a sort of perfect circle in their political trajectory because there are some similarities - I do not want to extend the analogy too far - between the centralised, undemocratic and overbearing communist regimes and the trajectory on which the EU is now beginning to travel. It is increasingly beset with a democratic deficit, where unelected Commissioners, central bankers, European Councils, troikas and all the rest are dictating policy over the heads of ordinary citizens and their elected representatives. Maybe they feel comfortable with the EU as it is currently developing because it reminds them of the good old days of Stalinism.  If there is a worrying growth in the far right in Europe, as there is - people have alluded to it - who is to blame? It is those who are at the helm of the EU and the policies which are being pursued by the EU which created an unprecedented economic crisis and produced a situation whereby we now have 11% unemployment across Europe and far higher levels of unemployment among young people. Some 24 million people are unemployed. It is those conditions of economic crisis, mass unemployment and enormous alienation from the political structures of the EU that are producing a very worrying rise in the far right. The people who should put up their hands and say they have to bear responsibility for this worrying development are those at the helm of the EU.  Let us be absolutely clear. Asking for a review of our relationship with Europe and the policies of the EU is not a statement of wanting to return to some sort of isolated, "go it alone" policy. Rather, it is about questioning the current trajectory and policies of the EU which have led us into the crisis and asking whether should we look at alternative visions of Europe or internationalism.  Let me state clearly for Deputy Nash and anybody else on the other side of the House that I am a thoroughgoing internationalist, as, I believe, are most of those who support the motion. The question is what kind of internationalism and EU do we want. Do we want an EU dominated by corporate interests, bankers and unelected bureaucrats or should it be a social union which prioritises jobs, democracy, environmental protection and sustainable development? That is the Europe we were told in treaty debate after treaty debate that we were getting, but the truth was revealed when the economic crisis hit.  The priorities of the EU were first and foremost to protect private banking interests across Europe. Mass unemployment, huge social dislocation, mass impoverishment for many people and forced emigration was just so much collateral damage we have to put up with in the so-called structural adjustment programmes which have been applied to us. Refusing to even consider alternatives to blind and slavish adherence to the euro and current euro policies is precisely the sort of groupthink and herd mentality that led us into the crisis in the first place.  That is what Nyberg said about the financial crisis. He said the political establishment in this country was gripped by groupthink and herd mentality, and dismissed out of hand contrarians, as he called them. We dare to be contrarians and ask whether the current policies are working, against a background where the whole of the EU is contracting, there is deep alienation from the structures of the EU, some countries are talking about pulling out and the periphery countries have been devastated by the current policies of the ECB and the troika. I laugh when I hear that we will be saying "goodbye" to the troika. We will say "goodbye" to the troika and "hello" to the six-pack, the two-pack, the EU Commission, the ECB and the fiscal treaty. That is the troika; we are saying "goodbye" and "hello" to the troika. There is an alternative.

I also commend and thank my colleague, Deputy Pringle, on tabling this important motion as the future of this country is at stake.  Our people have a duty to be informed and we as public representatives have a statutory duty to keep our citizens and civil society informed. The motion is also very relevant in the current economic climate where we have mass unemployment and poverty, and small businesses are being wiped out. We need to take a closer look at the economic policies of the eurozone leaders which appear to have lost touch with the people.  Each day in my Dáil office or constituency office in Donnycarney, people contact me about major economic difficulties in their lives. They are real people with real problems, and are calling out for radical solutions and support. It would clearly be wrong or ill informed if we ignored Europe, the ECB and the European leaders and their role in this crisis. That is what this debate is about. Of course, the senior bankers who lied and misled many people in the banking crisis must be mentioned in this and any other debate on Europe. That is what the motion is about.  I recognise that there has been no proper discussion of the fundamental flaws in the eurozone from an Irish perspective. Let us have an analysis of this. The eurozone exchange rate is generally unsuitable for Ireland's unique pattern of export and import trade inside and outside the eurozone. The eurozone put us under the control of the ECB, and as a consequence the Government has no economic policy beyond preserving the euro. A lot of people are asking questions about this and demanding answers. It is a very important issue in regard to the broader issue of Europe. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, is in the Chamber.  I refer to the EU and foreign policy issues. It is within the OSCE and a reformed UN, and not the EU, that Ireland should pursue its security concerns. Ireland should pursue a positive neutrality and independent foreign policy, and not join or form an association with any military alliance such as the WEU or NATO. It is something we have to monitor. We know a section of the Government is very much in favour of that. Ireland should seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation and, therefore, should oppose the militarisation of the EU.  Most people in the Technical Group, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, are internationalist in their outlook. Ireland should refuse to co-operate with or condone any policies or military groupings which maintain nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction. Irish troops should only serve abroad as peacekeepers under the auspices of the UN. These are the issues we want to raise and highlight.  People like Deputy Harrington made flippant comments about extremists and far right groups. The motion was tabled by people who care about their country, have an international outlook, are very supportive and are not racist in any way. We would challenge, dismiss and tackle groups like UKIP any day of the week. Only today, leaders in Europe discovered that in the region of €1 trillion was lost in taxes across Europe in the last couple of years.The €70 billion this country is putting into its insolvent banks works out at €38,000 for every working person. If we include the €35 billion assigned to the National Asset Management Agency, that figure is €57,000. It is reasonable to raise these issues. It is reasonable to put forward a constructive analysis of what is going on in Europe. In particular, we must be vigilant regarding statements by leading European politicians and policy makers that the crisis in the eurozone provides an opportunity to push ahead towards a fiscal and political union. The Union is increasingly losing its legitimacy and authority among European citizens who feel only a scepticism and cynicism in respect of the policies being pursued and the direction in which their masters are taking them. Those masters should take note because some among their number have already been kicked out of office. There is a democratic deficit here which, if it is to be addressed, will require listening to the concerns of ordinary people. There is a serious problem when economic policies are not working. There is cause for serious concern when foreign policies are not working. When foreign policy is such that silence is an appropriate reaction when ten Afghan children are blown to pieces by NATO bombs, then there is something very wrong. These failures of foreign policy will damage Ireland's reputation as a nation independent in the conduct of its affairs on the international stage and committed to the United Nations. That is the direction in which Ireland and Europe should be going.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	450	I thank Deputy Thomas Pringle for bringing forward this motion. It is particularly timely given that the Taoiseach is representing Ireland in Europe today. I was somewhat surprised to hear that Deputy Olivia Mitchell has accused Deputy Pringle of sedition in tabling the motion. That seems a rather extreme reaction, particularly as the wording has echoes of a speech that was made from the Park recently. To associate the President of this country with sedition seems to be going a little too far. The motion is extraordinarily welcome because it revives to some extent the need for Europe to provide visionaries and for this nation and its Government to have a vision of what Europe should be. In recent times, by contrast, all that has been happening in Europe is fire-fighting. The Irish Presidency has been marked by a failure to achieve any of its objectives as it instead engaged in that same fire-fighting, some of which was inevitable but a great deal of which was not successful. It was most welcome, in the midst of all this fire-fighting, that we had a magnificent speech from the President of this country setting out his vision for the future of Europe. It is a speech, unfortunately, that has not been taken up by those in the Labour Party who were, once upon a time, committed to the types of ideals put forth by President Higgins. Now, however, they are prepared to take a line which represents a fairly slavish adherence to the groupthink to which Deputies Finian McGrath and Richard Boyd Barrett have referred. It is very sad that Europe is now marked by crisis after crisis, whereas originally, as President Higgins observed repeatedly in his speech, it was marked by vision after vision. Europe has indeed been successful in its primary objective of preventing another world war. Since achieving that objective, however, it seems to have lost its way. Deputy Pringle's motion speaks of the subservience to the eurozone and the focus on the preservation of the euro. Survival of the European idea and fiscal integration seem to be the only objectives of the Union today. That position is not in any way reflective of an ideal but is merely a practical, German-driven objective to which Ireland seems to be paying a great deal of subservience. What the President was saying so eloquently in his speech from the Park - which, for some reason, has not been debated in the House nor taken up by his former Labour Party colleagues - was that Europe lacks democratic accountability. When he mentioned fiscal technocracy he was referring to the various institutions in Europe which are dictating the pace of progress to democratically elected leaders. This was not, one assumes, simply a reference to the German hegemony, to which he referred almost directly, as well as the French hegemony and others, but also to the fact that those ideals on which we in this country have always placed great value, including citizenship, are not being pursued by the Government in this country, although he failed to name that Government specifically. Where are the ideals of the European founders today? What is the Taoiseach, as President of Europe, saying about those ideals? I have not heard the news today but it was prefaced quite clearly that his intention was to defend Ireland's status as a tax haven. He intended, it seems, at once to deny that status and to defend our record as a place where tax advantages are taken by foreign multinational companies. This begs an important question. Why is Ireland permanently on the back foot in Europe? Why is our Presidency being marked by the fact that we are again on the back foot? Why is the Taoiseach, as President of Europe, having to defend our record when he should instead be promoting those ideals for which he has always apparently stood? Why is he not achieving the things he said he would achieve? Where are the jobs? Where is the growth? What are the achievements of the Irish Presidency? What has come of the declaration he made this time last year, on 30 June, that there would be an end to the connection between banking and sovereign debt? That has not happened; in fact, it is going backward. Any such disconnection has been denied by those in Europe who are showing the lead to other countries. What is so disappointing in all of this is that Ireland, in its current pivotal position in Europe, has not only failed to deliver on those objectives it set itself but is also failing to pursue openly the great vision which the President of Ireland showed to his colleagues in this House just a few weeks ago.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	451	The European Union's austerity doctrine imposed the burden of adjustment to the post-2008 economic collapse on the labour market. It is an indefensible misuse of economics that the eurozone authorities should seek stability on the back of tens of millions of unemployed. This month's eurozone unemployment figures reached yet another record. It is equally indefensible that within an economic epoch categorised by intellectual capital and innovation, youth unemployment should now stand at an average of 25% and more than double that in some of the peripheral countries which are most in need of that intellectual capital and capability. At this stage in the recessionary cycle there is no sense in what is being done to the economy and what is being planned for forthcoming budgets. After five austerity budgets, this country's deficit has been reduced at a terrible cost and with much further to go. Austerity policies reflect the self-interest of other, larger EU powers and are leading to the impoverishment of a growing number of countries. The only response to this has been a call for more integration or, to put it another way, a greater accrual of power and control to the centre. It is the policies dictated from the centre that are the cause of the problem and which are now subverting the original purpose of the wider European project.The eurozone authorities were wrong in their myopic fixation on reducing debt and effectively ignoring what is the key to the whole ratio, growing gross domestic product.It defies common sense that an Irish Government should still feel obligated to defend such policies and attempt to impose two more years of "fiscal consolidation". Talk of "exiting the bailout" is wide of the mark. The burden of "troikanomics", including onerous debt-servicing costs, stretch into a future that is dominated by those who preached the austerity doctrine in the first place. Ireland's growth capacity has been compromised; the best and brightest — our engineers, architects, doctors, nurses, teachers, entrepreneurs — have left and the morale of those remaining is being destroyed. This is not "adjustment"; it is tantamount to self-harm. The second reason for a managed exit by Ireland is that these same policies are doing enormous damage to two of the most fundamental pillars of a stable and functioning democratic economy... At the micro-level, in schools and local health provision, they are doing damage that will take years to reverse... Austerity has, however, reinforced German hegemony within the eurozone and there is little evidence of the solidarity that was once at the heart of the European project... There is no longer any appetite for the argument that only further integration will solve this crisis. This is a self-serving argument and finds no resonance among national populations. There is always a danger to democracy when the elite — the "authorities" — become semi-detached from the beliefs of the people from whom they get their legitimacy... Those who aspire to national leadership would come out from behind the barricades of "There is no alternative" and would take up again the freedoms and responsibilities of which they are trustees.These are not my words but those of an established and prominent economist, Professor Ray Kinsella, Professor of Banking and Finance at the Smurfit Post-Graduate Business School of UCD, writing this week in the Irish Examiner. He was arguing for a managed exit from the eurozone but not the EU, effected through a meeting of peripheral countries to plan resistance to the EU central powers. This motion does not go that far. It merely seeks that the option of leaving the eurozone be made available through planned treaty changes and that is a proposal I support. I am amazed that both Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil seek to delete this call from the motion. The achievement of such an option would be only the start. The central EU powers should be told that Ireland's bank-related debt must be mutualised across the eurozone in proportion to GDP, otherwise Ireland will unilaterally default and encourage other peripheral countries to do likewise and that Ireland would have to consider exiting the euro irrespective of treaties. Without such a stance there will of course be no re-negotiation, just continued capitulation to the austerity policies of Germany and its allies. Today vulture finance companies are buying half the country for a song and international investors are raping the country like the British landlords of old. Davitt organised a plan of campaign and Connolly set about the re-conquest of Ireland. We are faced with a similar task today but where are the Davitts and the Connollys? Soon we will commemorate the centenary of the 1916 Rising and like Pearse, I am convinced that this generation will rediscover new leaders who will push aside the current ones on their way to the re-conquest of Ireland. I support the motion.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	452	Prior to the Maastricht treaty the creation of the European monetary system in 1979 functioned fairly well due to the residual capital controls and the frequent exchange rate alignments. After 1987, however, the system became far more rigid while capital controls were abolished as a result of the Single Market programme. Countries were increasingly obliged to follow the German interest rate policy which became more restrictive in the wake of the unification of Europe. The subsequent collapse in 1992 and 1993 can be seen as inevitable since there was a limit to the extent to which the national governments were prepared to subordinate national monetary policy to the requirements of a fixed exchange rate regime or to tolerate higher interest rates and growing unemployment in order to stay pegged to the Deutsche mark. In our case, within the eurozone, we have become victims of excessive lending and a rapid growth economy fuelled largely on the assumption that the lending was reckless and was channelled through the books of the banks and other financial institutions. The result has been a property bubble, wage and cost inflation, the loss of competitiveness, the eventual crisis associated with the rediscovery of risk, the reversal of capital flows and the insolvency of the banks through which the capital flows had been channelled. It is our misfortune that unlike Finland and for instance, even the United States and the UK we do not have our own currency to devalue in order to regain our competitiveness. Since 2008 we have been pursuing a policy of disproportionate slashing of public expenditure. For such a strategy to succeed and to have any chance of working everything else has to go right. In particular, foreign economies must remain buoyant since export markets become vital when our own domestic economy is being squeezed. The chickens are now coming home to roost as a result of our compliance with European austerity since 2009 and 2010. This was egged on by the conservative-minded people who saw this as a great opportunity to shrink the State and at this stage it is an unmitigated disaster for the country. In order for such a strategy to work debt burdens also need to be reduced which is one reason among many why saddling the Irish taxpayer with the debts of the now defunct banks is unconscionable and unethical in the extreme. The recent Croke Park II deal was rejected and that is a rejection of the servitude which the Irish people have had to endure over the past four years. Hopefully the Labour Relations Commission, with Kieran Mulvey, Kevin Foley and Anna Perry will succeed in achieving an amicable settlement with all the people employed in the public service through the revived discussions in which they are now engaged. If they achieve this they will have done what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, failed to achieve with his initial proposals in those talks. Some of the proposals put to nurses, teachers, gardaí and local authority workers and all the others employed in the public service were toxic. We all recognise that the gap between current expenditure and revenue has to be gradually closed in the medium to long term but we cannot achieve growth in the economy and therefore growth in employment by this means solely. If this course is to be pursued further and is the only option we are going to take we will grind gradually to a halt, employment will grind down and eventually the economy will be ground down to the floor. The ECB should look at what the Fed in the US is doing under Ben Bernanke and the UK Central Bank under Mervyn King. Both have controlled policies of systematic quantitative easing, in other words, they are printing their own money. Although everyone realises that this is a policy that one can pursue for only two or three years at least it improves the liquidity in the economy. The problem in the eurozone is that there is a paranoid relationship with the German economic psyche which fears the slightest increase in inflation and no matter how irrational this may be or how short to medium term it has not allowed the ECB to pursue the policy being pursued in the United States and the UK.In addition to this, the Central Bank, in association with the European Central Bank, should carry out an econometric analysis of the effects of a devaluation of the euro which would make exports for the eurozone more competitive. I support the motion tabled by Deputy Thomas Pringle and the Technical Group.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-22 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	453	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett spoke about the lack of democracy in the decision-making process in the European Union. The Lisbon treaty which was passed in 2009 and which he strongly opposed extended co-decision making to the European Parliament which now has the same powers as the Council which is made up of the Prime Ministers of the member states. That is an extension of democracy. There was also an extension of democracy to this Parliament which now has new powers to have an input into the decisions of the European Union. The institutions of the European Union have not only been added to through the European External Action Service but also through greater transparency. The extra democracy added to the Union’s institutions by the Lisbon treaty was opposed by the Deputy who claimed there was a lack of democracy in Europe. The number of countries that wish to join the European Union is increasing all the time. If matters are so bad in the Union, why are so many countries anxious to join? Deputy Finian McGrath referred to militarisation and believes we are joining NATO. We are not. Any time we embark on a peacekeeping mission it is subject to the triple lock mechanism which requires a UN Security Council resolution, a Government decision and a parliamentary vote. In fact, the European Union is far from being about militarisation. On 23 April in Pristina representatives of Serbia and Kosovo sat down to agree to parity of esteem between the two countries for the first time ever under the umbrella of the European Union. In the 1980s the Union brought in Spain, Greece and Portugal, former dictatorships. It is now achieving the same purpose in the Balkans and it is a desirable approach. I agree with the President, Mr. Higgins’s remarks on seeking a review and a renewal of the European Union to ensure solidarity and a vision for peace remain part of its goal. Deputy Shane Ross asked why Ireland should be on the back foot. It is obvious why it is on the back foot. It is because of the actions of bankers and their henchmen and the way our finances were undermined. The Deputy asked where were the jobs and growth the Government had promised. We promised we would travel using a roadmap that would require a degree of austerity. That is what we have had and sacrifices have been made. In 2011 we witnessed the first period of economic growth in five years, with a growth rate of 1.4%. In 2012 it was 0.9%. This year the ESRI estimates it will be 1.8% and could be 2.6% next year. This is happening at a time when we are still in a bailout programme and only Germany is experiencing any growth, while the rest of the European Union is stagnant. We are on the way back. James Connolly who was referred to by a Member opposite was actually an internationalist. He would have been the first person who would have wanted to see a cross-border union, with member states united in solidarity. He would have welcomed this approach towards peace in the European Union, with solidarity between peoples and communities.

It is a subject that was overdue for debate in this House and I hope that after this debate it will be debated further by the media and the people, as it is one of the most important issues facing us. Deputy Olivia Mitchell accused Deputy Thomas Pringle of sedation, which is incorrect. It is more correct to say the majority of parties in this House are guilty of sedating the people. For the past two decades they have sleepwalked the people into a situation where we are now told we will all starve, unless we opt for a complete united Europe. We are told that when we vote against European treaties, we do not understand them. This evening Government Deputies have told us we do not understand what is good for us. Deputy Fergus O’Dowd told us to have sense and wake up, yet that is the very reason parties such as the UKIP, the UK Independence Party, are doing so well in Great Britain. Parties such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Labour Party here are ignoring genuine concerns about how the European project is going. Saying to people they do not understand is driving them into a frenzy and getting them more annoyed. They do understand when they see their children are out of work and neither the European project, the Lisbon treaty nor the European Stability Mechanism has delivered jobs. No matter how many times the Government tells them to wake up and have a bit of sense, it will not work, unless the problems created are solved. With regard to the eurozone, it is time to do the proverbial or get off the pot. It has to be one or the other. Either we go hook, line and sinker for full fiscal union or we move in the other direction. The last opinion poll on this issue showed 25% of people in the State believed we should move in the other direction. It is bad enough now with how we are dictated to by the European Union. If we opt for full fiscal union, it will tell us everything we should do and we will have no choice. There are two straps on the straitjacket already. Opting for full fiscal union will put another one on it and leave us in serious trouble. We were told by Deputy Harrington, to provide some reassurance, that to understand how wonderful the euro was, we should look at where we were.That is not the best way to reassure people. One of the reasons we are experiencing massive debt is we joined the eurozone. I acknowledge we had rubbish Governments, which did not help. We are experiencing massive unemployment. I am looking at where we are. Is that meant to encourage us? Let us look at where we were, a time to which Deputy Noonan hopes we can return, when we had real growth. At the time, during the 1990s, we had our own currency and we were not connected to sterling. Ireland had just pulled out of the ERM. We were connected to no one but ourselves and we made the decisions. Economic growth between 1993 and 1999 was 6% on average. We have never experienced that without imaginary growth generated by housing bubbles and unlimited credit. We have proven we can go it alone. It is not the case that eurozone members only buy our goods; we buy an equal volume their goods. It is not as if they will get thick with us and not sell their products to us anymore. Trade will continue, as it should. We should have a little more confidence in this country. We have brilliant things going for us. We have every right to be as confident as the Swiss, Norwegians, Swedish and Icelanders, who all have their own currency. We have more going for us and it is time the Government parties stopped putting us down and saying we cannot survive. We can survive on our steam if we give it a chance.

Cheap mé go mbéimid i bfhad níos fearr as fanacht amach but the people voted several times and that is where we are. I am glad I live in a democracy. I believe in democracy, particularly as a woman, when I think of those countries where there is a lack of democratic rights because people live under dictators or despots. However, our democracy is being seriously undermined by the decisions that are being made about us, our society and our economy outside this country. As the motion states, we are under the control of the ECB as a member of the eurozone. Coming down the line is an unelected European Commission setting out a range of fundamental EU treaty changes. How is that democratic? We spent 800 years under British occupation and we have had approximately 90 years of independence. I wonder whether we value this independence and why the Government is content, for whatever reasons, to allow the Union to be master of our destiny. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pringle in getting this topic aired in the Chamber and in opening up a proper discussion on the eurozone. There was a nationwide public consultations process for the review of the White Paper on Irish Aid. It was a good process and I would value a similar process to examine our membership of the eurozone. Like Deputy Catherine Murphy, I am a member of the Constitutional Convention, and there may be a role for the convention in this regard when we conclude the eight specified topics under discussion. Our President recently asked what we mean by "European" and by "the Union". These are the central issues that should be addressed in the public debate. Two phrases apply to our membership of the Union - one is putting all one's eggs in one basket and the other is the little fish in the big pond. An unlimited supply of money to banks and states led to a crash and nobody wanted to hear the words "Enough" or "Stop". We then had the massive blanket bank guarantee here followed by massive devastation and burdens on eurozone members, including Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Italy. We are members of this EU club and being a member of a club carries responsibilities, which I accept. However, we also have rights. Some of our rights are being eroded. Where is the justice for people in bailing out every bank and bondholder and implementing austerity? There is little equality and democracy in the EU club. We are paying disproportionately and those who had the least to do with the banking crisis are paying the heaviest price. I support the Ballyhea Says No campaign to meet high level ECB and Commission officials to discuss these matters and for them to hear the voices of ordinary people instead of the voices of politicians and their officials. The fiscal political union has done little to address the social pact, which was an original fundamental of the Union. I was impressed by what the President said when he referred to the loss of social cohesion and the deficit of democratic accountability. He reminded us of what European values were - personal dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and rule of law. Those values are being seriously undermined because we are not seeing an EU that is inclusive or respectful of equality; we are witnessing an unelected Commission determined to pursue the establishment of the great European marketplace that will protect certain people in institutions with little or no regard for ordinary people like the unemployed and the disabled - daoine ar an imeall. We had a lovely video from an inner city school a few years ago, "Give Up Yer Aul Sins". It is time we had a similar one entitled "Give Up Yer Aul Austerity". Membership of the eurozone has to be a vehicle to benefit all in Irish and European society. We are giving away control of our economic destiny but alarm bells rang when I read about Mr. Barroso wanting to transform the EU into "a federation of nation states with increasing powers for Brussels". He further said: "The world needs a Europe capable of deploying military missions to help stabilize the situation in crisis areas... and to begin truly collective defence planning." Our Army has done great work as a peacekeeping organisation and it has a role working with armies in the developing world on human rights and on the treatment of women. I would like to keep our membership of the Union under review regarding its benefit to the people of Ireland and not just its benefit to certain sections of our society and provided we can preserve our autonomy.

The motion only calls for two simple actions - to initiate a debate through civil society on the future direction of the EU and to ensure treaty change includes a process to allow members to voluntary leave the eurozone and not the Union. What was missing from the Government contributions was a discussion about the future of the Union. That is a sign of the problems in the State and the Government. There is no discussion about the future. I remind Members that Barroso, Hollande and Merkel are all talking about the future and they have a map and a plan of where the future will lie. Barroso has said in the past that Europe has all the hallmarks of an empire. On 7 May, he stated: "The proposals he will bring forward on treaty change will look like political science fiction but they will be a reality in a few years time". He is looking to the future and he knows what future he wants for Europe. Hollande wants an EU government with harmonised taxes and budgets to tackle the crisis. Merkel wants more Europe and wants to work towards the creation of a European army. They know the future they want and is it because the Government parties know what it is that they do not want to have this debate and do not want the people to know where the future lies. The future is a united states of Europe or a federal Europe with an army and a centralised government in which a nation such as Ireland will have no say and will only be a small part of it. The amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are interesting. The parties have pegged their political futures and the future of this country to stabilising the euro and getting through this crisis with the euro intact. The trade off for that will be the political science fiction to which Barroso referred coming to fruition. The political parties will peg themselves to stabilising the euro and, in the meantime, sleepwalk the country into the united states of Europe. The Taoiseach stated in the House last June that this would never happen and he would never let it happen on his watch. However, it will happen over the next few years and we will wake up some morning and realise we are in a united states of Europe with everyone wondering how we got there. We will have arrived at that point because we pegged ourselves solely to the preservation of the euro. The only policy the Government is pursuing is to maintain the euro and the trade off for that will be the creation of the European super state that the elite in Europe wants to make a reality.That is the sad reflection of this Government's policy on the eurozone and the euro currency. We should ensure a treaty change to allow a member state to voluntarily leave the euro and leave policy options open. Fianna Fáil said the euro is irrevocably and irreplaceably here to stay. The European Central Bank said the same and that it was never intended that any member state would leave the economic and monetary union but this motion calls for that option. It is a policy option which a Government can pursue but every party in this House has tied itself to the euro and the further integration to complete fiscal union and to the political union which goes with it. Deputy Mitchell accused me of sedition for tabling this motion. I am afraid we need to see more sedition in this House. We saw the sedition of the Labour Party before the election when it promised all sorts of things in terms of what it would do in Europe. However, when it got under the ring of Fine Gael, which is the Irish version of the Tory Party and not anybody on the Independent benches, its sedition was slowly put to an end. We need more sedition and more debate about what the future holds so that we can make our decisions on the basis of knowledge and not blindly follow what we are told to do.
