#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Governments must make choices every day, and sometimes they are difficult choices.  I have disagreed with many of the choices made by this Government in recent years, particularly on spending.  The Taoiseach is well aware that in recent days, 60 organisations providing services to the intellectually disabled are now being forced to either reduce services or to cut them out entirely.  This is having an enormous impact on those involved and on their parents, friends and families.  It is quite stressful to see the anxiety and distress this has caused.  The Taoiseach is aware the unit in Caherdavin in Limerick run by the Brothers of Charity that provides services for 377 people is to close and that two weeks' notice was given to the Daughters of Charity about the closure of the respite centre on the Old Cabra Road.The Taoiseach is also aware that the best value for money in the health service is given by voluntary organisations, none of which is represented by SIPTU or IMPACT.  These people have an enormous output for relatively little money.  In the context of priorities and choices that must be made, how is it in a country where there is so much obscene wasting of public money, that this sort of choice is forced on voluntary organisations providing services to the intellectually disabled?The Taoiseach is also aware of the consequences.  How can the Taoiseach justify the reduction of services that are so important to the well-being of thousands of people with intellectual disabilities at a time when there is obscene waste?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The whole purpose of the money that is allocated is to protect frontline services to the greatest extent possible.  As the Deputy has said, when I was Minister for Health and Children and Minister for Finance, I was anxious to support the area of disability services and brought forward a five year plan by Government to improve and greatly extend the range of services for people with disabilities, be they sensory, physical or intellectual.  More than €1 billion is being spent on intellectual disabilities alone.There are 178 service providers under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act.  Up to 90% of services are provided by 25 of them.  The important point, given that there are limited resources generally, and against a background of increased resources being given to this sector, is that the provision of services in the non-frontline areas ensures there is enough money at the frontline.  The Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Moloney, and the Minister for Health and Children are working to see how we can ensure that for the future.  Changes must take place in the support services behind the frontline services.  We cannot have 178, or even 25, service providers, even if they provide an excellent service.  There must be room for change so we can release resources to the frontline against the background of strict budgetary parameters.That being said, we must do everything we can to assist the most vulnerable.  That is being worked on as a priority by the Minister and the Department.  In the context of sustaining services for the future, there must be changes in how organisations cooperate.  Why should there be 25 different payroll systems, why should there be a series of different approaches by various organisations?  Those all must be pulled together so there are sufficient services at the frontline.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I do not doubt the Taoiseach's personal commitment to this area and I do not disagree that changes must be made.  I disagree fundamentally, however, with the fact that no analysis was done of the impact of across the board cutbacks before those changes were implemented.About whom are we talking?  These are children and young people with great difficulties in their personal lives because of the intellectual challenges they face, which leave them needing 24 hour care and attention, ranging from someone trying to understand their gestures to those with metabolic disorders and intellectual disabilities that cause serious behavioural problems.  The consequences of the administration minding itself and cuts in frontline voluntary services impact directly on these children and young people and, as a consequence, on their families.  I met some of them yesterday.  That respite has been taken away, even for four hours once a month, impacts seriously on their lives.  That is the consequence of such cutbacks.When the Taoiseach says he wants to do all he can to help this area, I take the sentiment at face value but what has happened in the Department of Health and Children?  What other choices are being made?  In the Vote for the Department's budget, the administration budget has gone up by 11% to €42 million this year.  That €4 million increase would keep the Daughters of Charity facilities open.  The increase includes rises of 67% for office supplies, 104% for consultancy services and almost 600% for value for money reviews.  The entertainment budget has been doubled from €100,000 to €200,000, which would keep one of the facilities open for this year.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I do not doubt the Taoiseach's personal commitment but this is what has happened under his nose, these are the choices the Government has made, these are the priorities the Government has decided upon and these are the consequences for those children and their families.  If the Taoiseach wants to make changes he should at least have looked at what the structure has done; it has protected itself and is demolishing services throughout the country to the detriment of people's quality of life, particularly that of young people affected by intellectual disability.  In what circumstances can the Taoiseach justify making choices such as this without examining areas where we could have had serious cutbacks in administration that would keep these levels of services open for those who so need them?

That work has to be done and it is precisely what is being done in the area of disability services.There are more than 176 providers of disability services throughout the country; there are probably more than 200 such providers.  Section 38 organisations include the Brothers of Charity which obtained approximately €125 million and the Sisters of Charity which obtained approximately €100 million.  Section 39 organisations are smaller organisations which receive a grant-in-aid from the Department.  There have to be savings in respect of how those services are organised.  It is clear we have to do this against the background of less money being available from the taxpayer to deal with these services.  We want to make sure that we protect——

How do we reduce non-frontline expenditure so we have sufficient funding for the frontline?  We all know some element of support expenditure has to be provided, no more than one cannot have a consultant in a hospital providing proper services without secretarial support.  We all understand it is not a black and white issue but it is an issue that needs to be addressed and will only be addressed if we re-organise how the services are provided.

Due to seasonal factors, the live register rises every June without exception.  The increase this year is considerably less than the increase in June last year of more than 21,000.  Based on seasonally adjusted figures from the Department of Social Protection, the increase in June is expected to be approximately 5,800.  The overall figures include more than 63,000 people who work part time and more than 23,000 people who sign on to claim credits.  Participation in the back to education allowance scheme has doubled this year and more than 5,600 of the inflow in the first three weeks of June are from this scheme.  The figure to be announced by the Central Statistics Office is 452,882.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That is the highest number of people ever unemployed in the State.  It is 300,000 more than were on the live register when the general election took place in May 2007.  It is 100,000 jobs lost each year that the Government in its present form has been in office, and 2,000 jobs lost each week.  This is not counting the number of people who have left the country as immigrants who have gone home and young Irish people who have emigrated to Australia and elsewhere.The biggest crisis that the country is facing at present is the level of unemployment.  Two weeks ago, I stated that according to the CSO figures, 40% of those who are out of work have been out of work for more than a year.  One in every three young men in the workforce is out of work.  It impacts on the level of poverty experienced by households and the self-esteem and morale of the individuals out of work.  It is the cause of huge worry to parents who wonder whether their children will get work or whether they will have to emigrate.  It also impacts hugely on the public finances because every person out of work represents a cost of approximately €20,000 to the State through tax lost and social welfare payments.When will the Government take seriously the issues of unemployment and getting people back to work?  The number quoted by the Taoiseach on the increase in the back to education allowances is marginal compared to what is happening.  The unemployment exchange in my constituency is beside a college of education with a cap on the number entering.  Increased numbers of people are out of work.  No active measures are being taken by the Government to get people back to work and very little is being done to get them into education and training.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	54	This is the issue with which we are dealing on an ongoing and daily basis and the only way in which we can create more jobs is to make our economy more competitive.  We have had this discussion on a number of occasions.  Jobs will not be created in a vacuum and will not be created on the basis of letting our public finances go out of control.  They certainly will not be created by the contention that we should not try to repair the banking system, which is fundamental.  The real issue and the contention being made by the Deputy is that no efforts are being made by Government.  It is very much the contrary.  All actions of Government are about making sure that growth comes back to the economy and in the second half of this year it has been confidently predicted that it will.  Indeed, from the last quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year some finance houses have suggested that growth is returning.The road back to recovery will be difficult and hard.  We know that and we want to get back on that road as quickly as possible.  The difficult decisions that we are taking have to be taken and are absolutely necessary.  Despite the disappointing figures this morning, I draw the Deputy's attention to the household survey which is the measure of employment in the country.  It is not correct to say that 450,000 are unemployed in the country.  There are 287,000 who are drawing unemployment benefit for five days.  There are 63,000 people who are working part-time and 23,000 people who are claiming credits.  Of the people who are applying for unemployment benefit whose applications are currently being processed, 20,000 are on supplementary welfare allowance.  These figures are for the purpose of putting the facts in place.I do not suggest for one moment that there is any degree of satisfaction or complacency about these figures but we will only turn this around on the basis of doing the job of work which the Government is engaged in, reducing our costs, getting exports going, as we are doing, and making sure that people can sell goods and services in the marketplace in order to maintain the jobs we have, take on part-time people in due course and then turn those jobs into permanent jobs.  That is the way back for this economy and it is the only way back.  We have to put our public finances in order in doing that.If we did not do that we would not be able to fund the deficit we have or maintain the services which, we have seen, are under pressure this morning.  We would not be able to continue as a country to work our way through this over the next number of years and get this country back to work.  Everything that we do is about trying to make sure that we get growth back into this economy.  It is coming in the second half of this year.  We have to hope that there will not be further turbulence in the markets.  There is no room for complacency here, week in and week out.  We are doing everything.In regard to the activation measures, it is simply not fair to suggest that we are doing nothing about it or are indifferent to it.  We have doubled the number of training places to 157,000 compared to 60,000 in 2008.  On the point made by the Deputy about post leaving certificate courses offered in the adjoining institution to the employment exchange in his constituency, looking at the national figure in 2010 almost 40,000 learners will participate in full-time further education and a range of schemes or programmes with an estimated 125,000 learners participating in part-time programmes.  One of the reasons there is a rise in the June 2010 figure is that those in receipt of the back to education allowance, which is suspended until September as it accords with the school year and which has been doubled this year, are obviously coming back onto the register and are in receipt of unemployment benefit until the back to education allowance returns.  That is a measure of the activity in that scheme and not inactivity.Everything that can be done to promote activation and find opportunities for people to up-skill and train is being done.  Increased resources are being applied.  At the end of the day, unless we continue along the road we are on to secure our children's future and do as we are doing it in the necessary way, we will put all of that at risk and we do not intend to do that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.Under the terms of an initiative introduced by the Department of Finance in August 2001, my Department pays the salary of secretarial assistants employed by former taoisigh up to the maximum of the higher executive officer standard scale.  The initiative provides that a former Taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for a period not exceeding five years from the date when he or she was last Taoiseach.  After the five year period has elapsed, only one secretarial assistant may be employed.  The initiative also includes provision for purchase of computer equipment necessary for this type of service.While there are no guidelines in regard to the type of work for which secretarial assistants are employed by former taoisigh, I understand that they carry out a normal range of secretarial duties to support the former taoisigh in carrying out those aspects of work associated with their former roles which remain after their period in office has ceased.  However, under the initiative, the secretarial assistant cannot engage in constituency or active party political work.

Is it the case that if they also continue to be serving Members of the Dáil — each of us as Members of the Dáil is entitled to the services of a parliamentary assistant and a secretarial assistant — that they are also entitled to the further services of two additional secretarial assistants, as the Taoiseach's reply suggests?  Will the Taoiseach clarify the situation?Will the Taoiseach accept that the recent reply to the parliamentary question I submitted to him has caused considerable interest?  My read of the situation is that people are aghast that former taoisigh, irrespective of whether they are actually serving Members of a current or future Dáil or have retired from the post, would be entitled to two secretarial assistants for a full five years and one thereafter indefinitely.  Does the Taoiseach not think that this scheme, which was introduced by the former Taoiseach in 2001, is wasteful and beyond the acceptance of people?  It did not have merit in 2001 but in the current economic times when serious downturns are affecting everyone's circumstances, what justification does the Taoiseach believe there is for the scheme continuing, given that what is involved is not small change?Is the Taoiseach aware that last year alone the former Taoiseach, who happens to be a current Member of this Dáil, secured——-

Is he aware that a sum in excess of €300,000 has been claimed by the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, since the introduction of the scheme?  Is he aware that over the past decade the former Taoiseach, John Bruton, has availed of the scheme while also involved during the greater part of that time in senior European Union representative roles?I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a wasteful scheme which has little or no justification.  The extent of the generosity if not the entirety of what was introduced in 2001 requires immediate review.  Will the Taoiseach accept that this is on top of the pension entitlements of former taoisigh?  I understand that it also——

Whether that applies or is utilised in all cases I cannot say.  Will the Taoiseach indicate how he feels about this scheme at this point in time, against the fact that there have been very considerable cutbacks in terms of the salaries and expenses of all sitting Members of the current Dáil and that this scheme has held in place and is now entering its tenth year?What, if anything, does the Taoiseach intend to do about it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I note that Deputy Ó Caoláin's questions concerned the allowances paid to former taoisigh.  This gives the impression, repeated in his supplementary question, that the money is allocated to individual officeholders and subsequently dispensed.  These sums are the wages paid directly to the secretarial assistants employed by former taoisigh.  The money is not given to former taoisigh; it pays the salaries of people who work for them, as outlined in the scheme.The Deputy may take the view that former taoisigh should not be accorded any assistance or support.  Former taoisigh remain public persons and continue to play roles under the Constitution and as former incumbents of the highest political office in the land.  I do not make any distinction and hold all former taoisigh in the same esteem, as we all should.  I regard this as an issue to be dealt with in the context of the work they do and the employment of secretarial assistants to support them in doing that work.  It is not correct to suggest that the money is an allowance or payment in order to feed into a cynical view that it is intended as an aggrandisement.  I do not agree with that suggestion and would like to accord some dignity to the matter.

I have at all times spoken about the provision of two secretarial assistants, which is the entitlement from the 2001 scheme.  If anybody is putting a spin on this issue, it is the Taoiseach.  I am trying to deal with the facts of this scheme, which was introduced by a former Taoiseach and, as it happens, applies to all former taoisigh, at least four of whom are availing of it and, therefore, one exception is not.I ask the Taoiseach once again about this important matter.  He himself will be a former Taoiseach some day.  Does he not think now is an appropriate time to pose responsible questions as to the suitability of two additional secretarial assistants, particularly if one is a serving Member?  It is quite incredible and seems over the top in terms of the supports required.  The issue merits at least a review of the curtailments that could be introduced, although a question mark remains in my mind over the entire project.  Does the Taoiseach even accept that in the context of a significant economic downturn, it is not justifiable to maintain the level of support of indefinite secretarial assistance for the lifetime of a former Taoiseach?

I am now asking the Taoiseach how he views the issue and whether he believes it merits an immediate review given our current circumstances, the serious cutbacks that have already been imposed on so many sectors of Irish society and the further cutbacks pending in budget 2011.  I urge him to revisit this scheme and to take a responsible approach to it if it is to continue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I emphasised in my earlier reply that these are not the allowances the Deputy suggested in his question for obvious reasons.  They are payments to secretaries who work.All areas of expenditure are, of course, kept under review.  However, previous incumbents of the office who have utilised the scheme have not done so on the basis of a full-time secretarial assistant every year.  The Deputy did not make that point in his contentions.  A former incumbent incurred a cost of €1,766 so far this year and €11,000 in a previous year.  Another former incumbent incurred a cost of €12,365 this year, €19,000 three years ago and €14,000 in the previous year.  In other instances, a full-time, full-year secretarial assistant was clearly utilised.  That could be said in respect of all the incumbents and a reduction in the costs are also clear as time goes on.Former taoisigh can be assisted in a cost-effective way.  They have a role to play in society and we should provide support where it is required and accord dignity to the office.  It is not a question of providing benefits to former incumbents; it is about the office and what it represents.

In the circumstances which used to apply in Northern Ireland, former taoisigh were provided with Garda security on a full-time basis.  I do not know if that continues to apply and perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify the matter.  If his Department provides other facilities, how does this operate?  If former incumbent X says his computer is broken, is there a service agreement to provide facilities?  The Taoiseach's immediate predecessor is entitled, as a Deputy, to a personal assistant and a parliamentary assistant and I am sure the facilities to which the Taoiseach referred are for additional secretarial assistance.

The scheme is as I have outlined it and all these matters will be kept under review.

Such proposals could give rise to constitutional amendments.

This has taken many forms in the House in recent months, including a Private Members' motion tabled jointly by the Labour Party and Sinn Féin.  There is a continuous and consistent effort on the part of all of those who gave service in the all-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, including its former chairperson, the Taoiseach's party colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, to urge certainty as to the Government's intention regarding the children's referendum in the current year.  Will the Taoiseach give a clear indication of when he proposes to hold the referendum?  Have deliberations between the respective interested Ministries and the Office of the Attorney General concluded?  Is the Cabinet of a mind to proceed with a referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution?  Will the Taoiseach, with but a week remaining in the current Dáil term, give certainty and clarity on this issue?  On our return after the summer recess, all political parties and independent voices in the House have a collective and shared job of work to do in ensuring the successful conduct of a referendum with an ultimate positive result in the interest of children first and foremost.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The senior officials group has met twice on these matters and has almost completed its work.  A range of implications  have been identified by the Office of the Attorney General and Departments.  It is incorrect to assume that the proposed wording should go straight to the people, as is, and there are no implications or there is nothing for the Government to do.  The Government must check out what are the financial implications, whether resource or other issues arise, if the acknowledgement of rights is sufficient and correct and whether the constitutional language provides the necessary clarity.Many issues are involved in this matter and any Government would have to look at them.  There are a range of implications.  For instance, are there unintended consequences?  All these issues have to be teased out.  This is a constitutional referendum.  While I know a great deal of good work was done by the committee which came to a view on the matter, the Government has a responsibility, before bringing legislation to the House, particularly on a constitutional referendum, to make sure we know and understand what exactly is involved.  We are agreed that we want to bring forward a referendum but we want to make sure we do so correctly and get the work done departmentally and interdepartmentally.  When the Cabinet has been able to deal with the issues that arise, we will come and discuss the matter.

This was reflective of the very serious backdrop to our deliberations and the ongoing revelations about serious failures of care in relation to children in State care and across the board.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that several months later, this sense of urgency does not appear to have translated into Government action in moving towards the implementation contained in the third and final report of the joint committee?  The Taoiseach is indicating that he disagrees with me.

The critical issue is that we have worked together and I am expressing no less a sense of urgency and commitment to the realisation of the joint committee's recommendations than members of the Taoiseach's party.  I am acknowledging that to their favour and indicating that we are all of a mind that this matter needs to be given the urgency it truly deserves.  That is the expectation of people in the non-governmental organisations who for decades have been campaigning and working tirelessly in the interests of children in this State who equally reflect those same opinions.Accepting that a job of work is under way and remains to be done——

Accepting that there was a job of work to be done, does the Taoiseach not accept that the urgency is not reflected in any stated intent on his part or the part of the Minister that the referendum will be realised in the current year?  Is it not within his gift to give the House certainty that we will have, in 2010, a referendum that will enshrine children's rights in the Constitution?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I assure the Deputy that I am as anxious to fulfil my job in this process as he is, as a member of the committee.  If it being suggested that when the committee brings forward a wording, the Government should step aside and we should get on with the referendum, that is not the process.  The Government has to work out what are the implications of the referendum and what unintended consequences could arise from it.  Every statement must be constitutionally right.I understand the work that was done and the wording proposed, some of which is very long.  However, this is not simply a matter of inserting the wording.  Judges will have to decide what was meant when this, that or the other was stated.  What are the financial implications?  Have the resource requirements been worked out?  One has to do this work.  One cannot simply decide that the committee has done a great deal of work on this matter and reached an agreement on it.This process started in 1993 with Catherine McGuinness and the Kilkenny incest case and much work has taken place since.  Wording was also proposed in 2007 and the joint committee was asked to see if it could reach a consensus on the issue.  It did two years' work on the matter, which came before the Government in February.  We must now get into the detailed work behind what has been put to us and see what are its implications, as any responsible Government would do.  It is also what those who have worked on the matter would expect the Government to do.I had a meeting on this issue with the Attorney General, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Ministers for Justice and Law Reform and Education and Skills at which we were updated on the issue.  This is not a simple matter.  While we are all agreed that we want to acknowledge the rights of children in our Constitution, we have to do this in a careful and considered way.  I recognise the work done by the joint committee.  To suggest that the Government is prevaricating, sitting on its hands or that this is simple stuff and we should have the referendum by September is to ignore the reality.  Let us give all sides some credit for taking our responsibilities seriously.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Taoiseach makes it sound as if the Government was not a party to the committee that produced the wording for the referendum.  It was represented on the committee.  The Taoiseach referred to a number of matters on which homework needs to be done.  I am surprised, as he appears to acknowledge, that no homework was done on the implications of the referendum — financial and resource implications and so on — in preparation for the Government's participation in the committee.This is the first time that I can recall that the Taoiseach has introduced financial and resource implications as a reason for delaying the holding of the referendum.  My understanding up to now was that the Government's position was that it was taking advice from the Attorney General in respect of the wording agreed by the all-party committee.  It seemed to be taking an unusually long period of time to take that advice.  I believe the all-party committee reported on the wording in February and we are still awaiting the advice.  The Taoiseach is now adding a new dimension into this, the financial and resource implications, which seems to be a way of basically blocking the holding of the referendum at all.

The question on the Order Paper asks what referenda will be held in the lifetime of this Dáil.  Will this referendum be held in the lifetime of this Dáil and if it will be, will it be held in 2010?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	88	This is one of the issues we are dealing with and which we would like to bring forward, obviously during the course of this Dáil, but the work needs to be done.  All parties were represented on the all-party committee.  Is it suggested that, as the Fianna Fáil party is represented on every committee in the House, when that party comes forward with proposals the Government must accept them because there were members of the party on it?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Yes, but the idea was to try to find consensus.  A consensus emerged that was different, if one likes, from what we had in 2007, which is why the committee was set up.  What are the implications of the consensus wording that has come forward?  What are the sectoral implications for education, health or any area involving children's rights?  What is the nature of the interventions that are being suggested in the wording?  What impact does that have on family rights or on children's rights?  What express further acknowledgement of existing rights beyond what exists in the Constitution are we talking about?  As the Deputy knows, constitutional law needs to be very carefully considered.  We do not do a service to the children of Ireland if we do not bring forward something that we know can be validated and acknowledged in our Constitution.  We do not want to end up in a situation where the words we propose could involve judges' interpretations that were unintended or could have consequences beyond the ability of an Executive to deal with.  These issues need to be very carefully considered.It is not for the purpose of making something simple complicated.  It is not for the purpose of wasting time or not being committed to it.  It is because the Government — as I am personally — is very committed to it.  I want to be able to stand over what is coming forward and do it right.  There are adoption issues and social protection issues.  The Deputy has seen the draft that has been proposed.  From other areas of family law or involving fundamental rights, he has seen what the implications and sometimes unintended effects of wordings can be.  He has seen that himself.  It has been our constitutional experience.  We need to work through this issue.I say to the House that this is an issue I take seriously and is being worked upon.  It in no way detracts from the work of the committee that was established to see what consensus could be built up.  However, the Government now needs to get into the business of working out the implications of what is being suggested.  It is a responsible thing to do to ask Departments, as I have now done, to consider what has been proposed here and, in so far as one can obtain a constitutional interpretation, see what are the implications.Can we give a broad figure of the resource requirements?  We need to know before we decide we are all in favour of putting a constitutional referendum on children to the people.  Then the people are entitled to ask subsequently whether we realised this, that and the other about it.  They could ask what our view was and whether we checked it out.  That is what is involved.  It is not in any way to be, as has been suggested for months, that we are simply messing around.  There is a lot of detailed work.  There are legislative implications beyond that regarding what is coming forward.The Members know that this is not a simple area; it is a very difficult area because it is also about the interaction of rights and children in the context of the family and what interventions are proposed, and the adoption issue.  I assure the House that we are working on this.

Has any Department flagged resource or financial implications, or legislative implications that are causing difficulty?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	92	At last night's meeting I made the point that the question of financial resources should be checked because the issues that arise are quite considerable.  If one were to look at what areas identified initially would require new legislation, it is not an exhaustive list.  Legislation on adoption would need to be published in advance of a referendum so that there would be a detailed understanding of what is proposed.  Legislation is required regarding the rights of fathers in non-marital families, which would require amendment of guardianship, adoption and family law legislation.  The explicit duty placed upon the State to provide care and protection to children would require extensive amendment to Child Care Acts, including, for example, the Child Care Bill currently going through the Oireachtas, if one were to take the wording as it stands at the moment.  The Government needs to come to a decision based on legal and other advice on the scope.  We do not want to end up with judges making allocations of resources.  The separation of powers must be respected.  We need to ensure we introduce something that will acknowledge the rights of children and the scope of that taking into account all the implications.  That work is ongoing.In adoption, the current focus on the best interests of the child would be changed to a focus on continuity of care, which could become paramount for the consideration of adoption decisions based on the wording we have at the moment.  Is that what we want?  If a right to continuity of care became the paramount duty, over and above the best interests of the child, a child could be left in an abusive or neglected situation.  That would be a very unintended consequence of what we are talking about.  If we gave constitutional status to continuity of care, how would that relate to inter-country adoption?  These are very complex and difficult issues.  That is only one area that arises.Looking at the wording itself, there is a lot of detailed work to be undertaken with some of the wording that is put forward.  That is work in progress.  I am not being definitive about this.  I am just trying to give an indication to the House of some of the issues that arise when one gets into the details of what is proposed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	93	From the Taoiseach's reply do I understand that there will not be a referendum on children's rights until the Government has settled in its mind on the resource and financial implications, and until it has published and put through the legislation the Taoiseach has now identified as arising from such a referendum?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	94	We are in the throes of discussions.  The scope and content of what we are discussing is of far wider implication than simply what one would expect just reading the report.  When one gets into it, this is an area that is becoming very complex and not easily resolved.  When we become clearer as a result of the work that is ongoing, we can come back and discuss it more cogently based on a clear view of where we are.I bring these matters to the attention of the House in an open, honest and transparent way to explain to Deputies that it is not just a case of producing the wording of the Bill.  That is not to in any way detract from people's work.  The job of the committee was to see if a consensus could be arrived at in what we would like to see in the Constitution and come forward with some appropriate wording.  That must be tested by the system and by the Attorney General.  We must determine the constitutional and resource implications and how we will do this, whether it is the right action to take and if we will be able to take some action.I have mentioned continuity of care over the best interests of the child and we must get the issue right because we do not want unintended consequences.  We are committed to the issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The only way I can interpret the reply from the Taoiseach today is that it is new.  The Taoiseach is now saying there is a range of issues, including financial and resource implications.  There is a body of legislation that does not yet appear to have been worked out or considered.  It appears the Bill is a long way from being agreed by the Government and published.  Therefore, the only conclusion to be drawn, and it is new, is that the Government is today telling us, in effect, that there will not be a referendum on children's rights in the lifetime of the Dáil.Given the Government's record in dealing with, prioritising and preparing legislation, it is clear the body of legislation described by the Taoiseach now will not be ready in time for a referendum on children's rights in the lifetime of the Dáil.  There is a pretence that somehow the all-party committee comprised representatives of political parties who came to some kind of view before the issue went to the Government.  Through a Minister, the Government was represented in an official capacity on the all-party committee and was part and parcel of it.  What has happened over the past 15 or 20 minutes on the issue is not just that the goal posts have been changed; they have been taken down and off the pitch.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Taoiseach is now, in effect, telling the House that because there is such a range of resource and financial implications for legislation that must be prepared, etc., the Government has dropped the referendum on children's rights.  That is a very sad day for the Government and the House, and it is certainly a very bad day for children of the country.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I am not playing politics like that with the issue at all.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	102	If the issue was put unabridged as it is, issues would arise that would have to be dealt with.  The examination is taking place currently at Government and interdepartmental level.  A senior officials group is working on it and I had a discussion about it last night at a ministerial level, getting a full view of where the work is currently.  I am coming to the House today to explain the scope of the issues, which are not insignificant.  If the Deputy were in my position, it would be his role to do the exact same exercise or he would not be doing his job, with respect.Whatever is required for us to do the detailed work, we will continue with it and bring forward ideas and proposals on the basis of that ongoing work.  I am trying to indicate our intentions in a frank and open way, out of the respect for the work others have done in this area, and to disabuse people of the idea that there are political shenanigans involving prevarication or putting the issue on the long finger.  It is a detailed and complex area of law that must be dealt with in a very considered and careful way.  I am saying it must be worked through thoroughly and that we are committed to this work.Based on Deputy Gilmore's observations, I accept this will be a difficult area to resolve and push through but this is not to in any sense dilute the commitment of the Government to the issue.  It is out of consideration of the commitment we have for the area that we act properly and correctly, as would be expected in addition to the work done by the committee in trying to build a consensus around the area.  We must now work out the implications of that work, any unintended consequences and the interaction of rights.  This is the work the Government is expected to do and I would not expect an all-party committee to have the resources to do this.  It is a different responsibility and a different job.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss the important matter of the proposed flood alleviation measures on the Dunkellin river in south Galway, which were promised by the Government some months ago.  I specifically ask the Minister of State with special responsibility for the OPW if the promise he gave to local politicians, farm leaders and community groups that a remedial scheme to improve drainage on the Dunkellin river would be fulfilled this June, if such plans are ready for publication and if he will agree that great value can now be obtained from the relevant contractors who have so little work to carry out and the exceptional good weather which makes such jobs much easier to carry out.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I seek the adjournment of the Dail under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, the urgent need for the Government to build the new cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, the need to deplore the recent delays on this major project and the need to ensure that cystic fibrosis patients have en-suite rooms to deal with the cross-infection issue.  I call on the Minister and the Government to ensure that 34 beds are allocated from the 120 bed unit for cystic fibrosis patients as a matter of urgency.As this is a serious national issue, I ask the Ceann Comhairle to consider a request for this debate.  I would like a two-hour debate any time in the next two or three days.  We are having Friday sittings and debates about stags and I ask the Ceann Comhairle to facilitate a debate on what the hell is going on in the hospital for cystic fibrosis patients.  In the past the Taoiseach has supported the project, along with Ministers.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I am very serious and I ask the Ceann Comhairle to consider the position.  We have Friday sittings and late sittings so surely we can agree to have a two-hour debate on what the hell is going on at St. Vincent's hospital to support these patients.  It is a life and death matter for these people, who have received promises from successive taoisigh.  It is a real issue for many people.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to consider my request.   I will not sit down until I get a reasonable answer.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I will deal with it but there is another Deputy offering.  Other Members must be considered.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of national importance and concern, namely, that figures published yesterday show suicides for 2009 increased by 24% over the previous year.  The figures show an increase from 424 in 2008 to 527 deaths by suicide last year.  The real figure is much higher; alarmingly, there were 195 deaths classified as "undetermined", with international research showing that a considerable number of these were suicide.  The Minister for Health and Children must recognise that the psychological impact of economic recession on public health is very severe and should immediately allocate resources to respond to the crisis.  I suggest that the issue is in the national public interest and is important.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Providing me and the Minister with five minutes to debate the issue of cystic fibrosis at St. Vincent's hospital is not adequate.  I am asking that the House facilitate a two hour debate on this issue any time during the next four or five days.  We have the option of debating this during Friday and late night sittings, which is the sensible solution.  Families need support and we need to know exactly what is going on.

The Whips can consider how it will be fitted into the schedule.

The House is sitting late and an extra hour will not make that much of a difference.  Staff will be here late either way.  The Minister for Health and Children should be asked to make a statement to the House at 10 p.m. tonight.

I am aware of the attention given by Deputy McGrath and other Deputies to this matter.  As Minister for Health and Children I was involved in ensuring the commencement of training for heart and lung transplants for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  I am aware of the situation.  I believe a great deal of work has been done in relation to this matter in recent times and that the Minister for Health and Children has been foremost in this regard.  I believe also there are prospects in regard to this issue from which greater clarity will emerge.  By way of assistance I, or the Tánaiste if I am not in the House, will try tomorrow to provide clarity in terms of where we are at on this issue.

It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and that business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; the proceedings on No. a14 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 75 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the speeches of the Taoiseach and leaders of the Fine Gael, Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Féin or a person nominated in his stead, who shall be called upon in that order and who may share time, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the suspension of sitting under Standing Order 23(1) shall take place at 1.30 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. a14, whichever is the later until 2.30 p.m.; and Report and Final Stages of No. 20a shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Social Protection.Private Members' business, which shall be No. 78, motion re patient safety authority (resumed) shall be taken at 7 p.m. or on the conclusion of No. 20a, whichever is the later, and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	222	There are several other ways to raise the matter.  I have no difficulty with the Deputy raising the matter at the appropriate time and under the appropriate heading but not on the Order of Business in this fashion.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I will revisit this matter.  I am asking the Taoiseach and Chief Whip to consider providing time either this week or next week before the conclusion of the current term of the Dáil to debate this critically important issue.  The House will next week slink off into the summer in shame if it does not address substantively this issue before then.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	224	No one on this side of the House is slinking off anywhere.

Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. a14 agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal relating to the suspension of the sitting under Standing Order 23(1) agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 20a agreed to?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	227	We have made soundings to the Taoiseach over recent weeks about the application of guillotines in this House.  In this case, I understand a raft of amendments will not be reached in the time that has been allocated.  On that basis, I oppose to the imposition of a guillotine on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I also object to the imposition of a guillotine on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  It never ceases to amaze me that issues which affect the poorest people in the country are always brushed aside in this House when Bills are rushed through and guillotined.  Such issues do not get the kind of media headlines that other issues tend to get.  Legislation that will affect the incomes of people on social welfare — people who have lost their jobs, pensioners, widows and widowers and people in difficult circumstances — is being rushed through and guillotined.  The debate on the amendments to the Bill will be truncated.  The various issues will not be given the time they require if they are to be addressed.  The most disgusting thing about being in this House is the way poor people are treated.  It is not even about how we divide on such matters, although we often disagree on them.  It is about the pure lack of respect that is shown to people who are not well off.  If we were talking about the incomes of people in well-paid employment, developers who are involved in the NAMA process or bank executives, loads of time would be devoted to it over many weeks.  When we are considering legislation that affects people who are not well off and do not have big lobby organisations to speak on their behalf, we guillotine it and forget about them.  It is unacceptable.  I appeal to the Government, which is proposing to guillotine the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 at 7 p.m. this evening, to provide more time to deal with the various amendments, including those tabled by Deputy Shortall.  It is not just a question of more time for debate — it is a question of showing respect to people who get very little respect in this House.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I would also like to object to the proposal to apply a guillotine to the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, which will have serious consequences for the lives of ordinary people.  I would like to know whether those who drafted the proposal to cease the provision of support to a lone parent when his or her child reaches the age of 13 have children of that age.  Do they realise that the outlay multiplies at that stage, rather than winding down?  As most Members of this House are parents, they have some sense or idea of the proportion of things.  One of the responsibilities of parenthood is to provide for one's children throughout their lifetimes until they are able to go out into the world.  This terribly punitive Bill does not take that into account.  It targets those who are least able to provide for themselves.  We need to have an opportunity to properly address everything involved in it.  The Bill that was originally presented was unacceptable under any circumstances.  Its added dimensions, which were introduced by the Minister on Committee Stage, have made it even more objectionable than it was at the start.  We are in a worse place now.  This Bill is to be forced——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The Deputy should keep his remarks brief.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	232	That was yesterday.  We need to move on.

The first step that needs to be taken to that end is the lifting of the guillotine, so that we can properly debate this Bill and explain that the measures contained in it are absolutely unacceptable.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Second Stage debate on the Bill in question lasted six and a half hours.  The Committee Stage debate on the Bill lasted all day last Thursday and resumed at 3 p.m. on Monday of this week.  All of the issues have been articulated, addressed and discussed.  The Report Stage debate will take place today to finalise the legislation.  Deputies will appreciate that the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 has to be enacted within a certain timeframe.  That is why we have to proceed.  It is incorrect to suggest, as has been suggested in this House, that there has been no debate on this Bill.  It is totally incorrect to suggest that any disrespect has been shown to those on social welfare.  The Government's record on social welfare provision over the past ten years has been far greater than anything Deputy Gilmore ever achieved when he was in office.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I understand it is proposed to guillotine the Central Bank Reform Bill tomorrow.  The Taoiseach will be aware the ECB issued a report about the inadequacy of the Bill presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan.  I hope the Whip does not proceed with the guillotine tomorrow.  This needs discussion, based on the reports that have been submitted in its regard.  I give the Taoiseach notice of that.I refer to No. 38, the electricity (transmission on assets) Bill, which deals with the statutory primary legislation for setting up EirGrid.  The Taoiseach is aware of the difficulty that has emerged because of the observation of a councillor that the notice of planning permission in respect of the interconnector programme to Northern Ireland has been withdrawn, after considerable expense.  The Taoiseach might indicate whether there has been any progress in that Bill.  The date involved was to be some time in 2011.I heard the Taoiseach comment recently on the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  The relevant Bill is expected but it is not possible to say when it might be drafted.  In view of the Taoiseach's comment on this during the week, has any progress been made and when might we expect to see the heads of that Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Central Bank Reform Bill is being dealt with tonight as well as tomorrow so there is some time to consider it.  The transmission Bill is due next year. I hope the legislation on the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority will be published in the next session.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	239	There is a report in the Irish Independent today that some relief may be on the way for homeowners who are struggling to meet repayments on their mortgages.  The Labour Party has been seeking this for more than two years and we will be delighted it the report is true.  It appears to be based on anticipation of a report from the group set up by the Government to look at the difficulties households are having in paying mortgages.  When will that report be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am not aware when it will be published.  A great deal of work is going on in this area and it will require further consideration of other possible measures.  It will be in addition to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears we brought forward.  We also provided additional staff to the money advice and budgeting service, MABS.  Some €64 million has been provided for the mortgage interest supplement scheme in 2010, which will assist more than 16,000 people this year.  These measures have ensured that home repossession levels in Ireland remain very low and mostly involved sub-prime lenders.The review group to look at solutions to the longer term problem is engaged and an initial report is due to the Government very shortly.  The review group has met many interested parties and has come up with some practical and creative options but we must ensure that direct procedures are in place so that everybody is treated fairly.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	241	First, I ask about the water services Bill, in light of the flagging of flat rate charges.  When will that Bill be introduced so that we may discuss it?Second, I refer to the mental health Bill.  Notwithstanding the terrible statistics my colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, read out today, the psychiatric unit of St Davnet's in Monaghan has been closed down.  Services are being curtailed,  a very serious matter that needs to be discussed in full.Third, and by no means least, I refer to the legal costs Bill.  Today we are talking about the elderly and disabled and the fact there is a major scarcity of money to sort out these problems but that elite legal group remains untouched although many years ago the then Minister for Justice assured us he would bring in a Bill——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The Deputy should make only a brief comment in his inquiry.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier comments about cystic fibrosis and that he will clarify the situation for the House tomorrow, through the Tánaiste.  However, if any further indication were needed for us to accept we have a very dysfunctional and broken health service, it is the reports today that people awaiting cancer treatment cannot proceed with that treatment because they cannot get necessary dental treatment beforehand——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Deputy, please.  You will have to find another way to raise this matter.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	248	——and others, including a lady with multiple myeloma and another person awaiting transplant cannot proceed with their treatment or transplant until they get dental treatment.  The GMS and the payments board have Paddy Burke writing to dentists telling them——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	249	This might be for consideration on the Adjournment.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Perhaps we could do that as well.  I merely point out that No. 63, the Bill on eligibility for the health and personal social services, will have very little meaning if this sort of behaviour continues and patients cannot access services——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Deputy, there is no need for the elaboration.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I ask about two issues.  One relates to the liberalisation of the postal sector in Ireland which must come into force on 1 January 2011, through the transposition of EU Directive 2008/6/EC.  Have the heads of the relevant Bill been discussed and agreed in Cabinet?  When will the Bill be introduced in the House and when is it expected the Bill will pass?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The heads are being drafted at present.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I have a second issue.  In 2009 a raft of criminal legislation was passed in this House which purported to confront criminal gangs and the gun killings that were taking place throughout the country.  Apparently, that legislation failed because now there seems to be a great difficulty in putting illegally held guns——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	260	We will not have comment or a debate on previous legislation.  We are discussing promised legislation and that is what we want.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I can go through promised legislation in detail if the Ceann Comhairle wishes me to but it will take a long time.  Otherwise I can go through legislation we passed last year which was deemed to be the answer for dealing with the issue.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	262	We cannot have such comment.  It is inappropriate and out of order on the Order of Business.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	263	If legislation we passed is ineffective it needs to be amended.  The Taoiseach can tell us that.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The query does not relate to promised legislation.  Is there any such in this area, Taoiseach?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	265	There is no promised legislation in this area.  A number of important pieces of legislation concerning criminal justice have been brought forward which are effective and are helping the gardaí deal with the very serious challenge to our society posed by violent crime.  It is important to acknowledge that the gardaí are doing all they can and that they enjoy the confidence of the public in the job they are doing.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I think this is the Taoiseach's third last day on the Order of Business before the summer recess.  I want to raise the issue of the tens of thousands people in estates, whether in apartment blocks or individual houses, who are subject to management companies.  The Bill that came before the House has never been completed.  In many cases——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Have you spoken with your party Whip?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Yes, just bear with me for a moment.  The builders and developers who control the management companies are gone bust.  In many cases, they are living in the south of Spain or some other sunny spot away from their creditors, and people are stuck in situations and they cannot get out of them.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	269	You can have a debate on the Bill when it commences.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	270	This is a serious human problem.  We had long debates yesterday about other issues.  This affects tens of thousands of young families.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	271	You are completely out of order on the Order of Business.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Where is the Multi-Unit Development Bill 2009?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I want to ask the Taoiseach about a second related issue.  There were widespread reports in the media that the Government was giving consideration to a package or a system that would enable a person to move their negative equity from their first mortgage to a subsequent mortgage.  How could they conceivably do that when most of those people are in managed estates?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	277	You are completely out of order.  Have we promised legislation in this area, Taoiseach?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	278	It is not technically possible.  Does the Government have legislation for people who are stuck in a first property and who for a variety of reasons——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Deputy, please.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	280	This was in the media at the weekend and was reported as Government policy.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Some co-operation with the Chair would be appreciated.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I am co-operating with you, but this is the third last occasion before the recess I can raise this really important issue for tens of thousands of young home owners.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Will you submit an item for consideration the Adjournment?  Will you submit a parliamentary question next week?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I have had it on the Adjournment five times.  I want an update.  When will the multi-unit development legislation actually go through this House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	285	It is on Second Stage (Resumed) at the moment.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I want to raise the same issue.  This Bill did not get beyond the Minister's speech on Second Stage.  The Taoiseach has promised on a number of occasions that we would deal with this.  If we could finish Second Stage, we could take Committee Stage of the Bill in July.  The matter is extremely urgent for all the reasons the Taoiseach knows.  That would require the Taoiseach to provide time next Friday or the following Friday in order to allow Deputies on this side of the House to speak on the Bill and to let the Bill reach Committee Stage in July and early September.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	288	These are matters for the Whip.  The Whip has set out what he is seeking to achieve for the remainder of this session.  I am not sure whether that can accommodate what Deputy Rabbitte is seeking, but these are matters for the Whips to discuss.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	289	This has been going on for about six years in the House.  The Taoiseach has committed on a number of occasions to seeing it through this term.  There is no provision in the schedule as it stands.  In advance of the final week's business, there is no reason we cannot sit on the Friday to dispose of what is a very urgent issue.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	290	In the renewed programme for Government, the headline commitment on animal welfare was the animal health and welfare Bill.  Stag hunting was just a subheading of that commitment.  The animal health and welfare Bill would be a much more substantial Bill in protecting the health and welfare of animals.  When will that Bill come before the House, or will it be left on the long finger now that the Green Party has got its trophy piece of legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I thought the Labour Party would be staying quiet on that today, given its own particular positions on it.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	292	There are many Fianna Fáil backbenchers who are quiet about it as well.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Can I take it that Deputy Tuffy will be allowed to support the Bill when it comes forward?
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	294	When is the long awaited forestry Bill going to come into this House?  We are now waiting seven years for it.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach has the stags preserved all over the country, they will need more forestry cover.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	295	It will come before the House later this year.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Can we have an approximate date?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We will get it done before Christmas.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	298	It seems to be the case that the Government has more concern and gives greater priority to the safety of dogs and stags than to children.  Could I ask the Taoiseach to tell us, first, where matters now stand with regard to the holding of a constitutional referendum to protect children's rights?  Will that Bill be published during the long vacation?  Will there be a referendum this year on that issue?  Second, what has happened to the legislation that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has promised is in preparation, arising out of the second report of the constitutional committee on children's rights with regard to protecting young people from sexual predators and improving the law in that area?Third, where now stands the legislation on vetting and the use of soft information from vetting?  Can the Taoiseach explain to the House why the protection of stags has a greater priority than the protection of children from paedophiles?Finally, a promise was made to this House that in the last week in June the report into the Roscommon incest case would be published and available to Members of this House.  That report was to be debated in this House before it went into recess.  We are now in the last week in June.  Has the Roscommon incest report been completed?  Has the Government received a copy of it?  Will Members of this House receive a copy of it by the end of this week?  Will it be debated next week in this House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I do not think there will be any prospect of it being debated in the House next week.  The schedule is quite full.  I am not aware of where the report is, whether it is to hand or not.  The Deputy will have to ask the Minister concerned.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Can the Taoiseach find out and communicate to Members of the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Perhaps if it was promised legislation, I would do that.  Perhaps the Deputy should contact the office.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Is the Taoiseach saying the fact that a number of children in a family were sexually and physically assaulted for a decade while the HSE failed to provide protection for them is not a matter that we should address in this House until next October?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	303	Deputy Shatter, allow the Taoiseach to respond.

We had a discussion about the position of the referendum during parliamentary questions.  That work is ongoing at Government level.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	307	Can the Taoiseach explain the thinking behind giving priority to the protection of dogs and stags instead of children?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I move:That Dáil Éireann:remembering all of those who were killed and injured on Bloody Sunday in Derry on 30 January 1972, and all of those who have suffered over many years as a result of that day;noting the further injustice perpetrated by the flawed and discredited report of the Widgery inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday;commending the families' long and difficult campaign for truth which in 1998 convinced the British Government to establish the Saville inquiry;recalling the support of successive Irish Governments and all parties for the families' campaign for truth;welcomes the publication and conclusions of Lord Saville's Report on the Bloody Sunday Inquiry;welcomes the clear conclusion that all of those killed and injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent;commends Prime Minister David Cameron for his response to the report and his generous apology to the families;recalls that many families suffered as a result of acts of violence, from all sides, and acknowledges the ongoing pain and suffering of all of those bereaved and injured as a result of the conflict;expresses the hope that the report's findings, the Prime Minister's statement and the response of the families of the victims and the people of Derry, will help heal all those families and others touched by the terrible events of that day;andreaffirms its commitment to building peace and reconciliation on this island and between these islands.I wish to speak on the agreed motion on the Saville inquiry report before the House.  I wish to acknowledge the presence of some Blood Sunday family members in the Gallery and welcome them here to our proceedings.On Tuesday, 15 June 2010, the report of the Saville inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday was published.  It was a day of many emotions: joy tinged with sorrow, relief and surprise.  It was a day of generosity and of vindication and, I believe, it was a day of healing.Bloody Sunday was one of the darkest days in the history of this island and in the relationship between the peoples of these islands.  I believe and hope that we will look back at the day the Saville report was published as being one of the brighter days in that long relationship.There was widespread sympathy for the families of those killed and injured but this time there was also some joy — sympathy for the terrible loss that the families and the people of Derry have borne for 38 years, and joy at the lifting of the black cloud that had wrongly been cast over the names of innocent men and women.When Prime Minister David Cameron addressed the House of Commons, he acknowledged that the events on Bloody Sunday were both "unjustified and unjustifiable".  The reaction in the Guildhall Square was heartfelt applause.  When he said that on behalf of his country he was "deeply sorry", that applause grew even louder.  The applause in Derry for the brave and honest words of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons was confirmation that the truth had been set free for the families of the dead and injured.  It was a historic moment, observed around the world.On the afternoon of Sunday, 30 January 1972, thousands of men and women set off from the Creggan in Derry on a peaceful civil rights march.  Thirteen men and boys did not come home that night.  They were shot dead.  Fifteen men and women were injured and one of those injured men, John Johnston, died only a few months later of his injuries.  Those deaths and injuries took place on the streets of Derry in the space of just one hour.  The images, on television screens and in the newspapers, of what happened that day shocked and horrified the people of this nation.  The then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, spoke of the nation's reaction to those terrible events in Derry.  He said that "grief and sympathy were hardly ever more sincerely felt, nor more widespread in this country".  In the days after Bloody Sunday, the entire nation mourned.On 16 June 2010, I was honoured that some family members travelled to Dublin to meet me, as Taoiseach, on the day after the publication of the report.  I offered them my best wishes on behalf of the entire nation.  They were exhausted after a very long and difficult day but they were also elated.  They presented me with a copy of the report for which they had waited so long.  I was pleased and humbled to accept that report, and their gracious thanks, in recognition of the role played by successive Governments and all parties in this House in bringing that long wait to an end.Today's motion is a further act of solidarity by all the parties in this House with the Bloody Sunday families and the people of Derry.  I am delighted that representatives of the families are here with us today.On the day the report was published, even in a moment of deep personal emotion for the families in Derry, they had the generosity of spirit to call for a minute's silence for all those who had died during the conflict.  They have known and lived with the pain of losing a loved one.  They know that far too many families across these islands suffered that pain during those dark years of conflict.  The pain and loss inflicted during the Troubles did not end at the graveside.  For those who suffered injuries during the Troubles, their physical wounds may have improved but they live with their scars.The catalogue of murders and attacks, from all sides, is too long to recount here today.  The suffering inflicted on ordinary people, on all sides, is too great to comprehend.  It is also too great to forget.  That is the terrible legacy of the Troubles.  As a society, we have to confront it.  As we do, we take inspiration from the families of those killed and from those who have been injured — from the tremendous dignity and bravery which these victims of unjustified violence have displayed in the face of unimaginable suffering.  What all these people have lost no one can return.  We owe them the assurance that the painful lessons of the past have been learned and that the suffering they have endured will not be visited on future generations.  This is not a simple thing.  Moving forward is not an event.  It is a continuing challenge to everyone, and a call to leadership.  We cannot allow such pain ever again to revisit the island of Ireland.  Now is a time to heal and to move forward to a shared future.Out of the dark years of the Troubles we have come to a new, shared idea of relationships on this island and between these islands.  The Good Friday Agreement is at the heart of our new understandings, it has opened up new opportunities for us to get to know each other in new ways.  It has opened up new possibilities, new perspectives around our shared history.  We will explore that shared history on many occasions over the decade ahead.  It is a decade which will see the anniversaries of events which have dominated the history of this island for over 100 years — the Ulster Covenant, the Great War, the Easter Rising, Independence and Partition — difficult and often tragic years, a time of division but also a time of optimism and of change.  We must take the opportunity of new relationships on this island to rebuild understanding over this decade of commemorations.  Just as the Bloody Sunday families came from the darkness of the past into the light of Guildhall Square, that should be the case for all on this island.For the Bloody Sunday families, the scars and the pain of their unspeakable loss were made worse by the inquiry chaired by Lord Widgery which blackened the names of innocent men.  The campaign to repudiate the Widgery report's status as the official version of events lasted 38 years.  It ended on 15 June.  The families can now say that the world knows that their loved ones are innocent and that their killings were unjustified and unjustifiable.  The years since 1972 have been long and difficult for the families and their supporters, but they never wavered.It has been a privilege for me to meet with relatives of those killed and injured on Bloody Sunday, a privilege I know is shared by many other Members of the House.  Hearing them describe how their lives were forever changed by the tragedy of that day, of the loss they carry with them still, it is impossible not to be moved.  It is impossible too not to be impressed by their commitment, quiet dignity, patience and steadfast determination, evident over the decades, to clear their relatives' names, to right the historic wrong that was the Widgery tribunal.The publication of Lord Saville's report is a vindication of these great efforts to have the truth told.  The Bloody Sunday families did not need to be told that their loved ones were innocent.  They knew.  In this House, we did not need to be told that their loved ones were innocent.  We knew that too.  The Saville inquiry was vital because the world needed to know and needed to be told that those who died and were injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent.  Now, as the families said outside the Guildhall on that momentous day, that innocence has been proclaimed to the world.  The inquiry lasted 12 years.  Members of the families of those killed and injured were present for every single day that the inquiry sat.  They listened to testimony that brought back terrible memories of that dreadful day but they felt that they owed it to their loved ones to be present.  The report of the Saville inquiry is a very long and detailed document.  I pay tribute to Lord Saville for his careful deliberation.Even now, the detail of the inquiry's report remains to be fully digested by the families and their representatives.  It needs to be carefully examined by the appropriate authorities in the North and in Britain.  Until such time as it is, we should, I think, refrain from extensive comment on it but, even at this point, it is worth observing the extent to which the inquiry has both stimulated public understanding of the events of that day and opened up discussion on the history of the conflict more generally.Several inquiries into other events from the Troubles have been undertaken or are under way and many other families are still searching for the truth about their loved ones.  The formal and complicated process of legal inquiry does not suit every situation.  Different models and approaches may be required to recognise particular circumstances and best meet victims' needs.  The PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland offer such approaches and I believe that their work has also been a source of comfort and solace to many families.Understanding the consequences of the violence which blighted this island needs no legal investigation.  The consequences are there to be seen in the damaged bodies and damaged families of too many neighbours and friends.  It knows no religious divide — suffering is no respecter of creed or age — but it reminds us of the fragility of our shared humanity.Despite the positive changes we have seen across this island in the past decade, it is clear the painful legacy of the Troubles remains a daily reality for numerous families and individuals and continues to have an impact on politics and society in these islands.  How we might contribute to the healing process is something which the Government will continue to take forward in our discussions with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  With the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Assembly earlier this year and the continuing transformation of politics in Northern Ireland, there is an increasing spirit of partnership and respect across this island.  The threat posed by a tiny minority who, despite everything, remain committed to violence is clear and real, but the determination of the people of this island, North and South, to oppose such violence is stronger still.In the Good Friday Agreement, the people made clear their commitment to peace, to a society founded on mutual respect, equal rights and opportunities.Those same principles and goals inspired the civil rights marchers who walked the streets of Derry 38 years ago.  The Saville inquiry was not about reopening old wounds but about healing the gaping wounds created by injustice.  One strong and clear signal that this healing has begun was seeing representatives of the Protestant churches — Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, the Rev. Good; moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev. Hamilton; and president of the Methodist Church, the Rev. Kingston — joining with the former Catholic Bishop of Derry, the Rev. Daly, and the families in the Bogside on 16 June to remember not only those who died on Bloody Sunday but all those who died in the Troubles.The statue presented by the church leaders to the families shows two communities not just reaching out to each other but grasping hands in common humanity and friendship.  When I met with family members in Dublin later that day they mentioned how much that gesture from the leaders of the Protestant churches meant to them.  The Rev. Good expressed the hope that the event would bring the people of Derry and Londonderry closer together.  The spirit of reconciliation that was shown by all those present that day will be a solid platform for the future.Today we, as the elected representatives of the Irish people, remember the victims of Bloody Sunday.  We also remember the thousands who died during other dark days of the Troubles.  Thousands of families suffered the loss of their loved ones.  Tens of thousands suffered physical and psychological injuries.  The violence that caused these deaths and injuries, from whatever quarter, was wrong.  It was not justified then and  — as those who seek to bring us back to those dark days need to know — it is not justified now.  The people of this island spoke loud and clear in voting for the Good Friday Agreement.  They rejected violence.  They said in unison, never again.  Too much blood has been spilt and too much pain and anguish caused.  There must be no more bloody days in Ireland's future.In a letter of thanks to supporters, the families of those killed and injured on Bloody Sunday said that although they had always known the truth, they can now rest easy, "safe in the knowledge that our loved ones have been officially declared innocent by Lord Saville".  The families deserve our admiration for their courage in pursuing the truth on what was a long and often difficult journey.  They have earned the right now to rest easy.  I was particularly struck by a remark made to me by Kay Duddy at our meeting on the day after the Saville report was published.  She said she had buried her brother, Jackie, 38 years ago but that the publication of the report meant he was now resting in peace.As we speak today we think of Jackie Duddy  and all the others who died on that infamous day in our history.  They are: Patrick Doherty, Hugh Gilmour, Bernard McGuigan, James Wray, Michael Kelly, William McKinney, Gerald Donaghey, Gerald McKinney, Kevin McElhinney, John Young, William Nash, Michael McDaid, and John Johnston.  Their innocence is now known around the world.  Their innocence is forever inscribed on the pages of the history of Ireland.  It is fitting that their innocence is today formally placed, once again and for all time, on the record of Dáil Éireann.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I am pleased to support this motion and I thank the House for agreeing to my proposition that there be an all-party response to the publication of the report of the Saville inquiry.  I recall 30 January 1972 very well, as do many Irish people.  The publication of the Saville report on 15 June 2010 brought truth and clarity into the public domain 38 years after the events of Bloody Sunday.  The report vindicates the fathers, brothers and sons who were killed and wounded, and the organisers of the civil rights march, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association.  The families of the victims must be foremost in our minds now that their loved ones' names have been cleared of any wrongdoing on that Sunday in January 1972.I hope the clarity of this key finding will help to provide some measure of comfort to the relatives of the victims who, for 38 long years, fought to have the events of that day thoroughly investigated and responsibility properly assigned.  The passage of time and the sense of loss and injustice they must have felt did not deter them from seeking the truth.  Crucially, Lord Saville's report has concluded that the fatal shots fired shortly before 4 p.m. on William Street in Derry on 30 January 1972 were not in response to attacks or threatened attacks.  Instead, he clearly lays responsibility for firing the first shot with the British army.  Having studied the events of Bloody Sunday for 12 years, Lord Saville's report is clear in its conclusions and is now the official version of events, countering the findings of the Widgery report which was produced three months after Bloody Sunday.  Lord Widgery had concluded that British army officers were fired on first.  The relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday never believed this and they were right not to do so.In 1997, 25 years after Bloody Sunday, the Government submitted a detailed report to the new Labour Government in Britain with a view to securing a new inquiry.  The Government stated that it had "long shared the widespread view that the Widgery report was unsatisfactory" and "did not represent the truth of what happened on that day."  The British Government agreed to the new investigation in 1998.  It has taken 38 years for the true events of that day to emerge.  When making its submission to the British Government in 1997, the Government stated that "the process of healing, reconciliation and ultimately of peace is advanced by a willingness on all sides and on behalf of all victims to acknowledge the overriding values of truth and justice."The then Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, agreed and said it was "the way forward to the necessary reconciliation which will be such an important part of building a secure future for the people of Northern Ireland."  Mr. Blair said he had been moved having spoken to the relatives of Bloody Sunday victims who, he said, did not want recriminations or revenge but simply the truth. The apology two weeks ago by the new British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, is significant and must be welcomed.  He was clear and contrite in his statement, describing Bloody Sunday as a tragedy that should never have happened.  It was, he said, "unjustified and unjustifiable".  The Saville report has since been accepted by all political leaders in Northern Ireland.There are many more families who have lost loved ones in the Troubles whose deaths have not received the same level of scrutiny.  These families do not have closure or a sense of justice for their loved ones.  We must begin anew the process of healing.  We should now take time to reflect on the next steps for dealing with the tragic legacies of the past.  The new Justice Minister for Northern Ireland, Mr. David Ford, stated on Monday that the Saville report has put "truth on the record" and that it undoubtedly raised questions of how Northern Ireland deals with its past and moves forward as a society.  He committed to ensuring his Department would play its part in contributing to the promotion of reconciliation and a shared future.The tragic events of Bloody Sunday were a turning point for Northern Ireland, forcing many who felt the injustice too great into supporting violence.  However, a very positive turning point in Northern Ireland's history came in 1998 with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is essential to ensure young men are not lured into these organisations by some romantic notion of Irish republicanism and the continuation of an armed struggle.  To achieve this we must continue to highlight in any way we can the necessity of implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement so that people will understand that co-operation and power-sharing are the way forward for peace and equality.I travelled to Belfast last week with members of my party to meet with Northern Ireland's political leaders following the devolution of justice and policing powers.  We discussed the Saville report, dissident activities and the possibilities into the future for the island of Ireland.  The Independent Monitoring Commission has stated previously — and Fine Gael wholly agrees — that the devolution of policing and justice brings important benefits to Northern Ireland, not least in allowing closer integration of law enforcement with other domestic policies.  It will have a real and positive impact on people's lives and the problems they face on a daily basis.I have had a difficulty with Deputy Ó Caoláin's party for many years on the issue of the army council of the IRA.  In my presence, following questions, both the president of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, confirmed that from every perspective they could see, the IRA and its army council are no more.  I accept the Deputy First Minister's statement in that regard.  I shall be writing to him in due course about several other matters.Thirty-eight years and five months ago to the day, 14 innocent men died.  It has taken almost four decades for their families to be able to stand outside the Guildhall in Derry and hear it announced that they were innocent.  I support this motion and commend it in its entirety as an overwhelmingly positive response from this Oireachtas.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I also welcome the intervention by the Taoiseach and acknowledge that now is a time to take stock, not to come up with further calls for other atrocities to be investigated, to evaluate this report properly and to listen to the people of Northern Ireland.On 30 January 1972, 28 unarmed civil rights marchers were injured, with 14 people subsequently dying.  The public acknowledgement of the innocence of these 14 people in Westminster by the British Prime Minister is significant historically and marks a watershed in our moving forward as a nation and in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  As the Taoiseach said, it is important that we listen to the people.  I met a woman from Derry who is friendly with some of the families who saw relatives murdered that day.  She spoke about the power and symbolism of the British apology, that it meant a great deal to see the British Prime Minister make that apology and emphasising the unjustifiable nature of these murders.We must also think about what we do next.  People will ask what will happen, a question Deputy Crawford, Deputy Kenny and I heard from many of the politicians we met in Stormont last Monday.  Where do we go from here?  The historical inquiries team has 50 detectives working on unsolved killings.  The Bradley Eames report raised the question of money in an insensitive way.  We must, however, look at the 3,500 who were killed in Northern Ireland as a result of the troubles, and the impracticality of a Saville inquiry for every atrocity.  There is general agreement across the religious, political and community divide in Northern Ireland that these murders were unjustifiable.  We must also take stock of Ballymurphy, Greysteel and other atrocities.  We must find a way forward and a solution.  We owe it to those who went through the 38 years of heartbreak, challenging a system to establish the innocence of their relatives, to take their viewpoints on board.I acknowledge the journalist Éamonn McCann, who has been at the coalface of the campaign for 38 years.  His name has become synonymous with the Saville report, a Derryman representing his people.  A family member of one of those killed was asked where we should go from here.  The answer was succinct, that we must keep on keeping on.  That is the call from those affected by this, they want to continue the debate and to come up with solutions for other atrocities.

Daly trying to bring about peace in whatever way he could.  We heard all the accusations and all the comments about who had done what and who was at fault.  We had the Widgery report and we now have the Saville report.  The Saville report led, most important, to the statement by the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, who clearly and distinctly apologised on behalf of his Government and the English people for what had been done.I am certain that not only did those 14 people die innocently, but as a direct result many other atrocities happened that might not have if Bloody Sunday had not happened.  I have heard many people say that it was as a result of that day that they joined the IRA and that other things then happened.  We have much to thank Lord Saville for.We must also find a way forward.  We have discussed the Dublin-Monaghan bombings in this House and unfortunately there has been very little support from the British Government when it comes to resolving this issue.  I have publicly stated that there are people who have refused to come forward. It is an ongoing issue that must be resolved.We can all think of the other atrocities that have had consequences for all sides in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  More than 3,500 were killed and I congratulate the Taoiseach for mentioning the tens of thousands who were injured.  People do not need to lose a limb in a bombing or see a loved one murdered, they had damage done to their way of thinking and their everyday lives.  As someone who had a brother who worked for a church there, I have no doubt many people much died earlier because of cancer and other problems than they would have otherwise.We must move forward and in that context, Deputy Kenny, Deputy McHugh and I went to Belfast to hold discussions with bodies such as Cooperation North.  The people in that organisation pointed out how they are trying to deal with some of the issues there.  I was in Glencree with some colleagues on Friday and Saturday at a workshop where there were people from the extremes on both sides who spelled out the difficulties and what must be done.This is all a work in progress and the Saville report has helped.  I thank my own moderator and other Protestant clergy for the role they played; it was significant and I hope we can all move forward to a more peaceful society, with structures that will give some satisfaction and comfort to those who lost so many over the last 30 years.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	318	On behalf of the Labour Party, I have co-sponsored the motion before us with the other party leaders and join them, and all Members of the Dáil, in support of the motion.  It is right and proper that we remember all those who were killed on Bloody Sunday in Derry on Sunday, 30 January 1972, along with all those who were injured and all those who have suffered over many years as a result of the events of that day.The events themselves were extraordinary and transformative.  A Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march to protest against internment without trial in Northern Ireland was taking place, with more than 10,000 men, women and children taking part in what was described as a "carnival atmosphere".  The march, prevented from entering the city centre by the British Army, moved instead to a rally at Free Derry Corner.  Then, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment moved into the Bogside in what was subsequently claimed to have been intended as an arrest operation.During the next 30 minutes these soldiers shot dead 13 men, and shot and injured a further 13 people, mainly by single shots to the head and trunk, assassination-style.  One of the injured 13 died subsequently from his wounds.It is not just the events of the day that we commemorate.  Intimately linked with Bloody Sunday is the name of John Widgery, the then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.  The soldiers responsible for the deaths and injuries insisted that they had come under sustained gun and bomb attack by members of the IRA and fired only at people in possession of weapons.  The Widgery report was produced within 11 weeks of Bloody Sunday.  Faced with testimony from the soldiers, who claimed they had been shot at, while the marchers insisted that no one from the march was armed, Lord Widgery produced a report which took the army's side.  In short, he firmly attached the main blame for the deaths to the march organisers, for creating a dangerous situation where a confrontation was inevitable, and he concluded that shots had been fired at the soldiers before they started the firing that led to the casualties; for the most part, the soldiers acted as they did because they thought their standing orders justified it; and although there was no proof that any of the deceased had been shot while handling a firearm or bomb, there was a strong suspicion that some had been firing weapons or handling  bombs in the course of the afternoon.  Lord Widgery said there would have been no deaths if there had not been an illegal march, which had created "a highly dangerous situation".We all recall that it was immediately clear that there were key problems and inconsistencies in this report.  Principally, Lord Widgery found no conclusive proof that the dead or wounded had been shot while handling a firearm, yet he accepted the soldiers' testimony and concluded that the soldiers had been fired on first.  He did admit that some of the soldiers' firing "bordered on the reckless".As Bishop Edward Daly said, "What really made Bloody Sunday so obscene was the fact that people afterwards, at the highest level of British justice, justified it; I think that is the real obscenity".  However, not all persons in authority followed the establishment line, as spelled out in Widgery.  Major Hubert O'Neill, the Derry City Coroner, in a statement issued on 21 August 1973, said:This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was.  It was quite unnecessary.  It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing.  They were shooting innocent people.  These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately.  I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated murder.  It was murder.People throughout the island campaigned for a new inquiry but they met with no response for many years.  I commend the families for their campaign and also the Government here which, in 1997, submitted a detailed dossier of evidence to the UK to back demands for a new Bloody Sunday inquiry.  That 178-page document incorporated an assessment of fresh information about the shootings, as well as a damning indictment of the Widgery report.  Some of that dossier was based on the new book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday by Don Mullan, which pulled together many previously unconsidered statements.  This dossier from the Irish Government, together with other factors, in 1998 convinced the new Labour government in Britain to establish the Saville inquiry.Lord Saville and his two colleagues effectively demolished the Widgery report, finding that soldiers lied about their actions and falsely claimed to have been attacked.  The report directly contradicts the findings of the Widgery report.  Lord Widgery, in his summary of conclusions, wrote:None of the deceased or wounded is proved to have been shot whilst handling a firearm or bomb.  Some are wholly acquitted of complicity in such action; but there is a strong suspicion that some others had been firing weapons or handling bombs in the course of the afternoon and that yet others had been closely supporting them.However, the Saville tribunal's principal conclusion is succinctly stated at Volume I, Chapter 4: "The immediate responsibility for the deaths and injuries on Bloody Sunday lies with those members of Support Company (of the Parachute Regiment) whose unjustifiable firing was the cause of those deaths and injuries."Lord Saville can right the wrong done to the dead and the survivors of Bloody Sunday by the Widgery report.  However, there were other consequences to the day which no report can right.  Throughout Ireland the Bloody Sunday killings resulted in a dramatic increase in support for militant republicanism in general and the IRA in particular.  The direct result was that many more families in Northern Ireland and throughout these islands suffered, as result of more and more acts of violence and counter-violence, from all sides.  For the next three decades, the only politics in Northern Ireland was the politics of the last atrocity and the only common experience in an increasingly divided community was the pain and suffering of the bereaved and injured on all sides.I hope and believe we have moved on, that we are, as the all-party motion states, in a new era of commitment to building peace and reconciliation on this island and between these islands.  I welcome the statement made by the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron.  However, while his statement may help to bring healing to the families touched by the events of that day, many sensitivities remain.  In particular, I recognise that righting one particular wrong done to one particular group is a sensitive issue when so many wrongs have been done to so many other innocent victims.  Some people in the Unionist community have criticised the cost of the Saville inquiry and the extent of the media attention given to the killings on Bloody Sunday.  They can point, accurately, to the contrast with so many major atrocities involving paramilitaries, which received much less attention.I have no doubt but that part of the reason for this difference is the very fact that the Widgery report was so fundamentally flawed in its methodology, analysis and conclusions.  It created doubts about the innocence of those killed and injured on Bloody Sunday, and imprinted those doubts about their innocence onto the public record.  Bloody Sunday shaped our history for years to come.  All of us have more work to do in developing a language and approach in which we can recognise and embrace the diverse origins and traditions of our people, and the achievements and sufferings of all traditions on this island, one in which we can recognise, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.Above all today, we remember those who died on Bloody Sunday, and the Taoiseach rightly put their names on the record of the House; those who suffered injury on Bloody Sunday; and those who suffered injury since, particularly the families.  We reassert, as the Saville report has done, that they were innocent, that a terrible wrong was done and that we move forward on the basis of the content of the resolution we are agreeing in the House.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I am very privileged to make this statement today on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas.  I have a vivid memory of watching the RTE evening news on that fateful Sunday in January 1972.  The events in Derry on that day proved to be a turning point for all of us living in these islands, and its consequences continued to resonate right up until earlier this month when the Saville report was finally published.After 30 January 30 1972, Northern Ireland descended into a vortex of violence which blighted lives across the island of Ireland, across Britain and in many places beyond these islands.  So many of our memories are scarred by the events which flowed from that Sunday in Derry, when British soldiers murdered many of our innocent fellow countrymen.  It was the day that the last flickering hopes died for successful civil protest against the blatantly unfair discrimination in Northern Ireland which the nationalist community had suffered since 1920.  For too many years after that day, the peaceful protest movement for fairness in politics, housing, jobs and social services was set to one side.  Reasonable and compassionate people who were ready to engage in dialogue and compromise to find a better way were increasingly forced to pick a sectarian side and stay with it.Put simply, sending heavily armed British paratroopers to murder unarmed, peaceful protestors lit the fuse for more than two decades of war and horror in these islands.  From then on, the paramilitaries held sway and justified the intransigent elements in the British Government in their taking ever harsher and counterproductive security crackdown measures.  It is impossible to overstate the importance of Lord Saville's report and the unequivocal acceptance of it by the British Government.  It is a boon for lasting peace and justice in these islands.Today, as has been said, it is a privilege to be called to speak here in Dáil Éireann and to continue to bear witness to the cruel wrong done to the 14 innocent Derry people and their families.  It is a great privilege to have a chance to salute and record the courage and fortitude of the bereaved families and friends in Derry who continued to fight and hope for justice over 38 long years of heartbreak.  It is an opportunity for us to thank the British Prime Minister David Cameron for the way he unequivocally endorsed the Saville report findings.  It was extremely important that he totally acknowledged that not one of those shot that day did anything whatsoever to justify the British army's murderous attack.Mr. Cameron's apology was all of 38 years late for the people of Derry and many more of us in Ireland, but it is welcome because it is heartfelt and, more importantly, it offers us the chance to move on from the shameful, mendacious whitewash that was the Widgery report.  I hope and believe that Mr Cameron's response helps our chances of finally moving on from that Bloody Sunday in Derry.  It is again a privilege to recall that all parties in this Dáil and Seanad have worked for 25 years for lasting peace in Northern Ireland.I want to briefly note that the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, from its earliest days has been an all-island party.  With people like Brian Wilson MLA, Steven Agnew and Cadogan Enright, we have worked to move the debate in Northern Ireland politics to a broader and more inclusive level.  I want to pledge myself and my Green Party colleagues across the island of Ireland, in conjunction with Green Party colleagues in Wales, England and Scotland, to continue this work.

The report of the Saville inquiry is a vindication of the 14 dead and the injured of Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972 in Derry.  It is an affirmation of the steadfastness of the families of the dead who campaigned for truth and justice for all of 38 years.  I begin by saluting the families, the survivors and the very brave people of the Irish city of Derry whose courage has long been a beacon for freedom-loving people in Ireland and across the world.The people of Derry have known from the day of the shootings that their loved ones, friends and neighbours were innocent and were shot dead by soldiers of the parachute regiment of the British army without any justification whatsoever.  It has taken nearly four decades for the British state to finally acknowledge that fact.  Long overdue as the acknowledgement is, it is still hugely significant.  It ends 38 years of denial and cover-up by successive British Governments.  The denial, the lies and the cover-up began in the immediate aftermath of the shootings and this is very clear from the Saville report.  The report finds that members of the parachute regiment knowingly put forward false accounts of their actions during the shootings, both in their initial statements and, many years later, to the Saville inquiry itself.What compounded the crime of Bloody Sunday was the legal and political whitewash that was the Widgery inquiry.  Widgery stigmatised the dead in order to exonerate the killers.  He stated that:There would have been no deaths in Londonderry on January 30th if those who organised the illegal march had not thereby created a highly dangerous situation . . . Some soldiers showed a high degree of restraint in opening fire, the firing of others bordered on the reckless.If there is one major flaw in the Saville report it is that it does not explicitly deal with that first so-called inquiry into Bloody Sunday.  Widgery was steered in a very definite direction by the then British Prime Minister Edward Heath.  In 1995 a letter was uncovered in the Public Record Office in London containing the minutes of a meeting between Widgery and Edward Heath on 1 February 1972, two days after Bloody Sunday.  Heath's most significant statement to Widgery at that meeting was the following: "It had to be remembered that we were in Northern Ireland fighting not only a military war but the propaganda war".When he was called to testify at the Saville inquiry, Heath admitted he had spoken to Lord Widgery prior to his inquiry and impressed upon him that the morale of the British army was at stake.  Heath denied to the Saville inquiry that he had given Widgery "a steer".  That a steer was given and duly obeyed was patently obvious when the Widgery report came out and it is undeniable now.  In all of its major conclusions Saville consigns Widgery to the dustbin of history.The Saville report found that the British paratroopers were responsible for all the deaths and injuries on that fateful day and that the soldiers opened fire without justification.  The report found that none of the killed and injured was posing any threat of causing death or serious injury when they were shot and that soldiers did not fire in response to attacks or threatened attacks by nail or petrol bombers.  Most damningly, it found that some of the victims were shot in the back as they attempted to flee.  One was shot as he was crawling away and another as he lay mortally wounded.The motion before us today, which the Sinn Féin Deputies endorse, welcomes the apology from the British Prime Minister David Cameron.  He made a significant statement in the House of Commons, significant not least because he is a Tory Prime Minister.  However, it is also a carefully crafted and precisely worded statement and should not be viewed uncritically.  There is much in it about the role of the British Government and the British armed forces in Ireland which we strongly contest.  We have never accepted, and the majority of the Irish people have never accepted, that the role of the British armed forces in the Six Counties was in David Cameron's words, "upholding democracy and the rule of law".  In our view as Irish republicans, quite the opposite is the case.Leaving aside his general remarks about the British armed forces, remarks aimed at a particular audience in Britain, it is necessary to examine what he said about the role of the British Government and senior British commanders regarding Bloody Sunday.  The Prime Minister claimed that those looking for premeditation, those looking for a plan and those looking for a conspiracy involving senior politicians or senior members of the armed forces would not find it in the Saville report.  However David Cameron also said, "The Government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces" and on that statement he based his apology.  Between these two statements by the British Prime Minister there is a gap that is not bridged by the Saville report and this is where the report is at its weakest.On Major General Ford, Commander of the British Land Forces in the Six Counties at the time, the report acknowledges that he issued a memorandum suggesting that so-called ringleaders of riots be shot after warning.  Saville also acknowledges that Ford's decision to use the 1st battalion of the parachute regiment in Derry is "open to criticism on the ground that 1 Para was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence".  However, Saville says he is sure Ford's suggestion to shoot alleged rioters was not adopted and also sure there was no plan to cause a confrontation with the IRA in Derry. The British army commander in Derry, Brigadier MacLellan, is similarly dealt with in the report, which accepts his claim that he had no reason to believe that the limited arrest operation he allegedly ordered ran the risk of death and injuries from unjustifiable shooting by the soldiers. No such distancing from the shootings could be sustained in the case of Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford, leader of the paras that day. He is strongly criticised by Saville for disobeying orders and sending the paras into the Bogside.What we have from the British Prime Minister is an acknowledgement of the ultimate responsibility of the British Government for the conduct of the British armed forces and nothing explicit in Saville to show direct responsibility by either Government or senior commanders, except Wilford, for the Bloody Sunday killings. However, the British Government and senior military commanders bear direct responsibility for the shootings, not necessarily through direct orders to shoot but by deliberately deploying the paratroopers in the full knowledge of their purpose and reputation. We know this from events prior to and following on from Bloody Sunday which, unfortunately, were not covered by Saville.I have already dealt with the Widgery cover-up, a whitewash initiated by the then British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, and used by successive British Governments for decades. Widgery was designed to shield the entire chain of command from Downing Street to the soldiers who fired the shots. It gave them immunity and they acted accordingly afterwards. In July 1972 the paras shot dead five people in Springhill in Belfast.Far less known is the prelude to Bloody Sunday from August the previous year. Over a three day period following the imposition of internment without trial on 9 August 1971 the same parachute regiment of the British army shot dead 11 people in the Ballymurphy area of West Belfast in similar circumstances to the Derry killings. All were unarmed civilians and included a mother of eight who had gone to the assistance of one of the injured and a parish priest administering the last rites. Some of the victims were shot on the ground while mortally wounded. We support the call of the Ballymurphy families for an international investigation into these killings and we urge the Irish Government to fully back that call by asking the British Government to co-operate.The people of Ballymurphy were attacked by the British army as it imposed internment without trial and imprisoned hundreds of people indefinitely on the basis of a ministerial order. The people of Derry were attacked by the British army on Bloody Sunday because they were participating in a civil rights demonstration against internment. The people of Ireland and the friends of Ireland were outraged by Bloody Sunday and the British embassy in Dublin was burned to the ground. People in the Twenty-six Counties were also attacked by British forces. Seeing the upsurge in support for Irish republicanism in the Twenty-six Counties in 1972, the British deployed their counter-gangs, the heavily infiltrated unionist paramilitaries. They bombed Dublin in December 1972, killing two people. In May 1974 they bombed Dublin and Monaghan, killing 34. Their purpose was to strike terror into the people in this State and to make them fear to show solidarity with the oppressed Nationalists in the North. This strategy was complemented by an Irish Government which sought to blame republicans for the bombings and which tightened political censorship and repression in this State.The Saville report has given badly needed hope to the bereaved and the survivors of Dublin and Monaghan and the other cross-Border bombings and fatal acts of collusion in this jurisdiction. In the context of this debate on Bloody Sunday and the Saville report's vindication of the families, it is a disgrace that the Irish Government has cut funding for the only victims' group in this State, Justice for the Forgotten. It is equally disgraceful the Taoiseach has failed to raise with the British Prime Minister this Dáil's unanimous call for the British Government to furnish to an international judicial figure all files in its possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the other fatal acts of collusion in this jurisdiction. It is almost two years since the Dáil passed that resolution on 10 July 2008. I call again on the Taoiseach to act. He could not wait for the ink to dry on the Saville report before inviting the English Queen to visit but he made no effort to progress that unanimous Dáil resolution by pressing the issue with the British Government. We know from the history of the Bloody Sunday relatives' campaign how the British system works so assiduously to conceal the information in its possession. Persistence has paid off before and it is required again to vindicate the families who have been campaigning so long and hard under the banner of Justice for the Forgotten.The Saville report took so long and cost so much for one reason, namely, the refusal of the British Government and its agents to tell the truth. The truth has triumphed, however. In the view of Irish republicans the length and breadth of this island, the ultimate act of justice for the people of Derry and Ireland will be the final removal of British armed forces and British jurisdiction from this country. We continue to work towards that day peacefully and democratically. We remember all the victims of the conflict without exception and sympathise with all the bereaved. We believe their finest monument will be lasting peace and reconciliation between all the people who share this island and between the islands of Ireland and Britain.

The abduction and false imprisonment of a person's family or friends to coerce him or her into assisting with a robbery is a particularly pernicious type of crime.  I feel nothing but contempt for those responsible and I know this feeling is shared by Members of the House and the wider public.  As the most recent incident is the subject of an active and ongoing Garda investigation and an individual has been brought before the court in connection with it, we are all constrained in what we can say.There are agreed response procedures in place for dealing with such incidents.  Regular meetings are held between the Garda Síochána and financial institutions to discuss bank security issues and in particular tiger kidnapping prevention and response protocols.  While the Garda Síochána does not as a matter of policy and security disclose the protocols, they typically include the establishment of crisis management teams and protocols designed primarily to ensure the safe return of those persons held captive during such incidents and thereafter to secure the arrests and prosecution of the culprits involved.  Advice on personal security for staff members and on systems and processes in place for the conveyance, storage and dispersal of cash is provided on an ongoing basis and is subject of regular review.It is incumbent upon the banks and financial institutions to do everything possible to counter these robberies.  This means the protocols must be followed and systems put in place to ensure that, for example, it is not possible for employees who have been placed under terrible duress to be in a position to access large amounts of cash.  I do not blame employees who are acting under such duress.  Their safety and that of their families and friends is paramount.  This is also the Garda priority and the safety of people can best be assured by involving the Garda as quickly as possible when these incidents take place.  When the protocols are followed the Garda is given a great advantage in its efforts to foil these crimes and arrest those responsible.  This has been proven to be the case time and again.  It is only by rendering these robberies unsuccessful that we will stop them taking place and thereby protect innocent employees and their loved ones from being caught up in them in the future.I assure the House that the Garda is totally focused in combating this form of criminality as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs.  New legislation has been put in place to provide for covert surveillance evidence to be used in court.  I have also introduced legislation which specifically targets the organised criminal gangs responsible for these reprehensible crimes.  While obviously I cannot go into detail about ongoing Garda investigations, I assure the House that the Garda has been taking action under the legislation and we will see the fruits of this as it builds up cases against the organised crime gangs, including those involved in tiger kidnappings.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I join the Minister in offering direct condemnation of the latest tiger kidnappings in the State, including one which occurred most recently.  Together, they add up to a serious problem as these despicable acts are occurring at a particularly frightening frequency.  What role does the Minister see for himself in addressing the matter of tiger kidnappings?While I do not wish to comment on any particular case or the specifics of the protocols, I put it to the Minister that his response to date has been somewhat less than meaningful in so far as a round of meetings takes place, the contents or circumstances of which remain outside the public domain and unknown.  While I do not expect the House to discuss to any great extent the protocols in place, it is clear they are not working.  What is the Minister's role in ensuring the protocols are sufficiently robust?  What steps can be taken to ensure compliance with them?I do not believe these vicious tiger kidnap robberies are entirely preventable given the hold on society of organised crime and gangs, particularly in certain areas.  However, the Minister's role must be more than one of a passive bystander engaged in rounds of meetings that seemingly are not working or contributing towards preventing these most despicable acts.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I appreciate the Deputy, as an Opposition spokesperson, must try to blame the Minister.  My predecessors and I have provided resources and legislation in this area and in recent days the Garda Commissioner has indicated he has all the resources he requires.As I stated, these types of kidnappings are pernicious crimes.  Where the protocols have been adhered to, however, they have been successful in so far as the crime has been prevented and the safety of the bank employees concerned, as well as that of members of their families or others involved in the kidnapping, has been protected.  The protection of human life is the foremost priority.The number of attacks on cash in transit vans has reduced substantially as a result of the introduction of new procedures and protocols which have effectively negated any profit criminals could make from such crimes.  Exactly the same principle applies in the case of tiger robberies.  It needs to be proven over time that such crimes are unsuccessful.  The modus operandi of the banks must include checks and balances to prevent one or perhaps two individuals in a branch having access to large amounts of money.  They must also provide proper training and guidance for staff — I understand this is being done — to ensure they fully understand that the protocols are in place for their own protection.  This will ensure tiger kidnappings are not replicated over an extended period.Unfortunately, every time a tiger kidnapping is successful, it is sends out a negative signal to the public and a positive signal to the criminals who believe carrying out such crimes has a benefit.  If we can establish a fool-proof system in which the protocols and systems in the banks are such that this cannot happen, a strong message will go out to criminals that this is not a lucrative crime.  Obviously, they will then try to find another niche.One is dealing with human beings and given the difficulties individuals and families are placed under, one will always have a weak link, as it were, in these types of circumstances.  I have spent much time with the Garda Síochána in this regard and I have had discussions with the banks and Irish Bank Officials Association, which has asked me for another meeting, to which I will agree.  I have also had a significant number of meetings recently with various interests which believe they have the wherewithal to assist in this area.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will ensure the Garda has all the resources it requires to stamp out this crime.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Does the Minister agree that the net issue is the ease with which criminals can access cash, whether by way of tiger kidnappings, ATM cash robberies or cash in transit heists?  As this money is insured in any event, protocols agreed can be cast aside with some ease.  I ask the Minister to ensure that efforts are made to reduce the circumstances under which large volumes of cash are carried.  We must look to international best practice whereby the issues of carriage of cash in vans, the ease with which cash can be removed from ATMs and tiger kidnappings have by and large been dealt with successfully by a co-ordinated effort which is not under way here — at least there does not appear to be any evidence to suggest that.The Minister mentioned that he hopes to meet representatives of the bank officials shortly.  I ask him to impress on the bankers the need to ensure proper and adequate training.  The level of training that appears to be available to bank officials and those handling cash does not give rise to confidence.  Would the Minister agree that banks have a duty of care to their employees to ensure that every available training opportunity is employed?  That training does not seem to be happening and verbal directions on protocols are wholly insufficient to deal with this most dangerous circumstance where life and limb are under threat.  Unless the Minister takes an initiative in this regard through ensuring that all the modern technological advances are employed to deal with cash in transit and to ensure that there is proper and adequate staff training up to international best practice, unfortunately gangland criminal operators and organised crime bosses will continue to engage in the type of activity we have witnessed because of the ease with which cash can be taken.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Following discussions I had with the banks and the Garda Síochána as a result of one or two high-profile so-called tiger kidnapping events, which were successful from the criminals' point view last year, there was a significant emphasis by the Garda Síochána and the banks on further training.  These gangs have to a certain extent moved down the employment ladder in the banks in that heretofore they targeted mainly senior management but are now moving down.  That begs a valid question.  Obviously the banks have a significant responsibility in ensuring that people to a certain extent lower down in the chain of command in the banks do not have an opportunity to get their hands on large amounts of money.  The banks have done work in that regard and significantly there have been a number of very successful recent operations from the Garda point of view.  I must stress again that in those recent successes the protocols were followed and the Garda was given the opportunity of being aware what was going on before any money left the bank.  In any of the unsuccessful operations, in the initial phases the Garda was given late notice and the money had gone from the bank before it was notified, which is the difficulty.  I do not want to go into too much detail on the use of the latest technological equipment that might be used in this respect, which the Garda and the banks are investigating.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The working group to which the Deputy refers was established by me in March of this year.  Its terms of reference were as follows:To consider the operation of the current system for determining the rent payable on foot of a rent review clause, with particular emphasis on the arbitration process and the adequacy of the information available to all parties and, if necessary, to make such recommendations for change as may seem appropriate.When I established the group, I was concerned to ensure its membership was such that any recommendations it might bring forward would be reflective of the broad spectrum of opinion in this area.  Thus, in addition to other participants, the membership of the group is drawn from key stakeholders in the retail and commercial property area.  It includes representatives from the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Small Firms Association, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, and Retail Excellence Ireland.  It also includes representatives from the Irish Association of Investment Managers, the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and the Society of Chartered Surveyors.The problems which confront the retail sector at the moment are not in dispute.  I have met members of that sector and listened very carefully to what they have had to say about the difficulties which they are experiencing regarding the rent issue in general.  In the legislative area, I moved very quickly last July to introduce a provision to prohibit upward-only rent review clauses in leases entered into as and from a particular date.  The date for the commencement was eventually fixed at 28 February 2010.  Action on pre-existing leases was precluded for legal and constitutional reasons.In establishing the group, I was conscious that concerns had been expressed to me about areas other than upward-only rent review clauses.  Specifically, there were concerns about the arbitration process and about the lack of transparency attaching to the provision of information.  Again, I wished to move quickly in an attempt to see if workable solutions could be devised to address these concerns.  Accordingly, I asked the group to report to me by the end of June and I am hopeful it will adhere to this deadline.  However, while the group is close to finalising its report, I understand that it will need a little more time in order to conclude its deliberations.  I have agreed that some additional time will be made available to the group to enable it to bring matters to a speedy conclusion.  I expect that the report will be finalised during the month of July.  It will, of course, be put into the public domain once it is presented to me.

I take it from what he has now said that it will not do so.  Is he aware that he made this announcement on the same day that my party introduced a Bill, given the emergency nature of the crisis in the retail sector to deal with the issue of upward-only reviews of rent?  On the same day that we published that Bill, in a knee-jerk action, the Minister set up this working group.  I have information from significant individual retailers to the effect that the working group is no more than window dressing because it is not addressing the inadequacies of the rent review system.  Will the group provide a register of lease interests?  Will it provide a definition of market rent?  These are just two of the critical issues involved in a sector that is the single biggest employer in the private sector, where 30,000 jobs were lost last year, a great many of them because of the inability of retailers to negotiate rents in line with trends in the market.  The reason it cannot negotiate rents in line with the collapsing market is because of conditions that provide only for upward review of rents.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	331	As I said, the working group was expected to report by the end of June.  It has asked for some additional time and its report will be published some time in July.  I do not accept it was a knee-jerk reaction.  It was a reaction by me to try to address some of the issues, such as the disquiet to which some people have referred regarding what they feel is a lack of transparency in the arbitration process and also the suggestion that some partial and misleading information is tendered regarding the rent review situation.I know the Deputy said he spoke to some of his friends in the Law Library who had some query about the gangland legislation.  I wonder whether he asked some of his friends in the Law Library about his party's proposed legislation on this matter, which was basically a sop that was not constitutionally or legally sound.  We are all on the same page in having sympathy and understanding of the difficulties in the commercial sector but we can only pass legislation that is constitutionally sound.  This Government banned upward-only rent for leases, albeit from a particular date into the future.We have clear legal advice on this from the Attorney General, and I hazard a guess that the Labour Party also has clear legal advice because its own Bill implicitly acknowledged that there was a significant problem in retrospective action for previous leases entered into freely by two parties.  The State and the Oireachtas cannot by legislation intervene and rewrite contracts that were validly entered into by two individual third parties who no doubt were legally advised on entering those contracts.The elephant in the room is that if the State and Oireachtas were allowed by legislation to intervene to change contracts, this could only be done on the basis of substantial compensation being paid to those disadvantaged by such action.  The Labour Party did not in its Bill suggest that landlords as a group should be either collectively or individually recompensed for any loss arising from legislation brought forward by the Oireachtas.  In the legislation it sponsored it proposed to give the Minister a regulation-making power without any indication as to how these regulations could be constitutionally sound.I made it clear that we can deal with leases that will be entered into in future.  I did this knowing full well that there would not be a significant effect on existing leases but it would send out a very strong signal to landlords that they should enter into renegotiation with tenants where there is difficulty.  I have anecdotal evidence from around the country — although not necessarily from Dublin city centre — indicating that landlords have adopted a realistic approach on the basis that half a loaf is better than none.  Instead of putting someone out of business, it is far better for such landlords to renegotiate the rent.  We can only do so much in the Legislature and we should not mislead people.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The Minister is correct in that we sought expert legal opinion in working on our Bill and my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, set that out when he introduced it.  We received further legal advice to the effect that the measures taken by the Minister, which only relate to the future, will have no impact on the economic crisis I am talking about in the retail sector currently, where 30,000 jobs have been lost and the normal rules of supply and demand do not operate.For example, when a code emerges — if it does — from the working group, will it be mandatory or voluntary?  When the Minister said he was sending a signal and some developers who owned premises have responded, it does not concur with the feedback I have.  He said that did not necessarily apply to the heart of Dublin and it does not, to the best of my information.  Our concern in this issue is one of employment, as there are retailers of long standing being put out of business because of the inability to negotiate market rents in line with present circumstances due to the upward only rent review provisions that the Minister is seeking to protect.  He is appealing to the constitutional provisions of private property in order to hide behind the skirts of the Constitution so as to not intervene, effectively, to preserve employment.

We can only act under the aegis of the law as we ourselves pass it and it is imperative, under contract law, that if two parties enter into a contract freely with legal and other advice, the Oireachtas cannot pass a law to change that.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	335	We are on the same page with regard to having difficulty with the circumstances of certain people who entered into rents at the peak of the Celtic tiger era.  We cannot pass a law here that would rewrite that contract unless both parties are willing to do it.  In many cases landlords are renegotiating and in some cases they are not.  It may very well be that a landlord or a body which provided a party with finance in order to produce a development is insisting on these circumstances and ensuring they get what is in the contract.We changed the law for future leases and there is information that this will have and already has had an effect.  With new leases, the market has dampened significantly and not just because of economic circumstances.  New leases not having upward only rent reviews is having a significant effect on the type of rent being sought.  It is providing certainty not only to landlords but to the tenants.  We have looked at this high up and low down and we want to be helpful to people finding themselves in difficulty.  We can only act in a way that is legally possible.I will go back to what I said on retrospective action on Committee Stage of the legislation we discussed yesterday.  The fact is we cannot pass a law today that would rewrite contracts entered into freely by people.  I know instances have been indicated by some people who say we can——

If we were to intervene and change contracts that were validly entered into without the consent of the two parties involved and where one is objecting, we would have to provide compensation.  The taxpayer would have to provide this to people disadvantaged as a result of us passing such a law.  What the Labour Party and Fine Gael are not saying is that the taxpayers, in effect, would have to put a hand in their pocket because of a law we passed and give money to landlords in order to compensate them for the loss of property right.

I was happy to obtain the approval of my colleague the Minister for Finance for this competition which was launched on 4 June 2010.  This forward planning is necessary given the lead time involved in establishing such a panel and in training recruits to the point of attestation.  Trainees will be subsequently taken into the college as needed to ensure Garda strength is maintained at an approved level.Maintaining the operational strength of the Garda Síochána at the approved level is my absolute priority and I am pleased we are making the necessary preparations to ensure this can be achieved into the future.  I should point out that as of the end of May 2010 the Garda strength stood at 14,571, with an additional 116 students in training and 555 Garda reservists available to the Commissioner.  This is higher than at the same date in 2009 when the Garda strength was 14,426.  There are also currently more than 2,100 civilian personnel who provide secretarial, technical, administrative, specialist and expert support services to the Garda Síochána.

In the context of the retirement last year of an unprecedented number of gardaí of varying degrees of rank, totalling in excess of 800, how many of those 800 retirees have been replaced, with specific reference to senior posts.  I again ask, having asked the following question on a number of occasions and having received a less than direct answer, how many of the 12 chief superintendents, 26 superintendents, 31 inspectors, 166 garda sergeants and 466 gardaí who retired last year have been replaced and how many senior positions, above the rank of Garda sergeant, remain vacant as of 30 June 2010?

If 776 gardaí retired and the figures increased by more than 100, obviously there were more gardaí taken on than retired during the past year.

For example, on 26 May 2009, the Government approved the appointment of three chief superintendents and ten superintendents.  Previous derogations culminated in the sanction of 170 promotions in February 2010.  On 2 February, 28 sergeants were promoted to the rank of inspector and 120 gardaí were promoted to the rank of sergeant.  On 9 February, the remaining inspector on the promotion list to the post of superintendent was promoted to the rank of superintendent.  On 11 February 2010, 34 gardaí were promoted to the rank of sergeant and a further 15 gardaí were on 4 May 2010 promoted to the rank of sergeant.  A competition for promotion from the rank of superintendent to chief superintendent has been finalised resulting in nine successful candidates being placed on a list, seven of whom were on 22 April 2010 promoted to the rank of chief superintendent.  A competition for the promotion from the rank of inspector to the rank of superintendent has also been finalised, resulting in 27 successful candidates being place on a list, 22 of whom were on 15 June 2010 promoted to the rank of superintendent.  The figures speak for themselves.  The number of gardaí in this country, almost, 14,600, is at an all time high.As I have stated time and again, I will do my level best as Minister to ensure the highest number of gardaí are available to the general public.  I have also stated that there has been too much criticism from Members of the opposite side of the House who want to have their cake and eat it.

It continues to criticise the Government for reducing this and that but does not come up with suggestions in terms of what should be cut.  I decided when I took up this portfolio that I would have to cut in some areas in order to prioritise crime and that is what I have done.  Investment in respect of garda numbers, CAB and addressing gangland crime has increased to the detriment of investment in other areas.  I must do more with less.  That is the reality in terms of the financial circumstances in which we find ourselves.  If we are taking in only €32 billion and are spending €55 billion, we must close this gap.  We must also ensure we spend smarter the €32 billion we are taking in and concentrate on priorities.  I have decided to prioritise the fight against crime, which requires more investment in the Garda Síochána.

Where stand these people in so far as the panel is concerned?I accept what the Minister had to say in regard to garda levels.  Where stands any targeted programme of civilianisation in terms of the Minister's statement in his reply that there are hundreds of civilian officers augmenting the Garda Force?  Is there a target in respect of a reduction in the ratio of civilian to ranked member?  On the community garda campaign — currently approximately 6% of the force comprises community gardaí — is there a target in terms of increasing those numbers in the context of the current recruitment campaign?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	366	On the existing panel, I understand approximately 150 applicants are available for recruitment.  These are trainees who are called strictly in order as placed on the panel.  There is also an additional 200 people on the panel who have not completed medical, physical and vetting tests.  The issue of how many will be brought on from this panel to the new one is dependent on the number of retirements this year.  It is anticipated that fewer people than retired last year will retire this year but we will not know this until the end of the year.  It is our intention to keep garda levels as high as possible.On civilianisation, there were virtually no civilians working with the Garda Síochána five or six years ago.  Currently, there are 2,100 civilians in this regard, which is a significant proportion in comparison with the number of Garda Síochána.  Obviously, the drive is to ensure that as many garda as possible are out on the streets and not in the Garda barracks.  However, it will never be the case that no gardaí will be in the garda stations because there is obviously specialised work that can be done only by the Garda Síochána owing to security issues.  This requires a continuation of gardaí working hand-in-hand with civilian staff in Garda stations.On community gardaí, I do not know the proportion of community gardaí but there has been a significant ramping up of the numbers of community garda.As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner and I have relaunched the community policing model .  I understand that at the last count, the number of dedicated community gardaí whose only job is to do community work was well over 1,000.  Every garda who is out on the beat is regarded as a community garda.  The number of specialised community gardaí is well over 1,000.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	367	In 2006, the Irish Prison Service launched an EU-wide tender competition for the design, construction, finance and maintenance of a new prison development by means of a value for money public private partnership.  The Léargas consortium was appointed as the preferred bidder for the project in April 2007.  An environmental impact assessment in respect of the development was published in February 2008 and development consent was granted by the Oireachtas later that year.  This development consent requires the construction of an access route and perimeter wall before the construction of the main prison buildings.The pre-contract negotiations on all aspects of the project, including its legal, technical and financial aspects, culminated in February 2009 when the Léargas consortium was asked to submit its best final offer for the development.  Following a detailed evaluation of the offer by the Irish Prison Service and its advisers, including the National Development Finance Agency, the offer was deemed to be not affordable in light of the significant increase in the cost of finance and, particularly, the increase of over 30% in the level of the annual unitary charge which would have been paid to the consortium.  The tender quotations for that PPP competition remain commercially sensitive.  The Department of Finance guidelines require the quotations to be kept confidential.  It is difficult to identify and isolate the costs that arose from the abandonment of the PPP competition.  I understand that significant costs fell on the bidders who participated in the competition.  The major cost to the State results from the delay in developing a modern prison campus on the site.The development is proceeding on a phased basis.  Phase 1 comprises essential enabling works that are required for the development, including the construction of a dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services.  Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in February of this year.  Tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.  I expect the first contract to be signed and construction work on the access road to start this summer.  All of these works are being done by means of traditional procurement methods.  Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus.  A detailed appraisal is under way in accordance with the capital expenditure guidelines of the Department of Finance.  The new business case is at an advanced stage of preparation.As I mentioned last week during the debate on the Estimates, my priority is to ensure that prison cells are made available at Thornton Hall as quickly as possible.  A phased opening of a prison complex at Thornton Hall would not be viable under a PPP approach.  Therefore, I favour proceeding using traditional procurement mechanisms.  I envisage the construction of the main prison campus in a number of stages, possibly three, with each stage being opened as soon as it has been completed along with the necessary ancillary facilities.  While this will increase the time schedule for completion of the overall project, it will mean additional capacity could be available up to two years before that envisaged under the PPP process.  It is still my intention to have a total of 1,400 cells with a capacity of 2,200 spaces delivered at Thornton Hall, but with earlier delivery of the first blocks and staged delivery of the rest.  The design prepared by the preferred bidder for the former PPP competition will not be used.I will bring this matter before the Government in the next few weeks for approval.  I will not be in a position to confirm the details, or outline an indicative timetable for the proposal, until the Government has considered my proposals.  As regards costs, it is not the practice to disclose commercially sensitive data in advance of a tender competition.  In the light of our current economic circumstances, it is clear that costs have to kept to a minimum.  The cost of the new approach will have to be substantially less than the final cost envisaged by the preferred bidder in the PPP competition.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Minister's response to my question about a major infrastructural project is a good example of the manner in which the Government treats the House.  It shelters behind commercial sensitivity and other protections in order to avoid telling the House what is going on.  I do not know anybody who agrees with the Government that a huge prison facility should be constructed on the Dublin-Meath border for an enormous amount of money.  Some €42.2 million has already been spent.  Did I hear correctly when the Minister said the money spent on professional fees — €7 million to date — and on the design work done under the previous arrangement has fallen and will not be utilised?  The construction of this facility is the only major solution that has been proposed to the crisis at Mountjoy Prison.  How can the Minister come in here, a year after the project collapsed, and say he cannot give me indicative dates for when the builders will go on site or finish, or when the prison will open?  All he has said is that the matter has not yet been considered by the Government.I do not know if the Government is serious about addressing the potentially explosive situation in our prisons.  I refer in particular to the gross overcrowding at Mountjoy Prison.  The Minister should put this House in a position to compare what is now being contemplated with what was agreed with the preferred bidder before the collapse of the project a year ago.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I question the Deputy's seriousness when it comes to addressing the problems in the Prison Service.  His party has objected to this project at every twist and turn.  The Government will make a reasonable decision when it has received the best advice from outside experts and advisers in the National Development Finance Agency.  It was clear in the prevailing economic circumstances that the PPP model was not affordable into the future.  We had to re-evaluate our plans, in effect, and proceed on the traditional public procurement basis.I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that I should mention indicative prices in the House, particularly in a pre-tender situation, as to do so would be to tell the world, including potential tenderers, how much they should be tendering for.  Deputy Rabbitte should understand from his experience in Government that it would not be wise to do that.  We are proceeding with the construction of the access road and the perimeter wall.  Tenders have been put out in that respect.  As I have said, the construction of the access road is expected to start this summer.  It is anticipated that the construction of the perimeter wall will start in January 2011.  In the next week or so, I will seek the approval of the Government to proceed on a public procurement basis, rather than on a PPP basis, to ensure we get the best value for taxpayers' money.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Minister says that during a tendering process, one should not advertise how much one is likely to pay.  That is exactly what the Government did when it bought the land concerned.  The Government let it be known that it had €30 million to spend on a farm on which to build a prison.  It got a farm, all right.  The Minister expects me to jump up and down and applaud him for building a wall around a farm.  That is as far as we have got after all these years.We are entitled to know what direction the Minister intends to take.  He has said he abandoned the PPP model because it was unaffordable.  I always contended that it was unaffordable and did not represent value for money.  The Minister believes he should be congratulated for abandoning the PPP model even though he embarked on a PPP arrangement in respect of this project in the first instance.  I do not doubt that traditional procurement methods would deliver this facility much more cheaply than the preferred bidder method that was contemplated at the time.  Can the Minister tell the House, so that Members can relay the information to people who are interested in penal policy, what kind of timeframe is envisaged before prison spaces will be available at Kilsallaghan?

When we came into office in 1997, we started a prison building programme and we have built 1,750 prison spaces since then.  We will be opening another 200 prison spaces in Wheatfield Prison in the very near future.  That is our record.  We will then build another 300 prison spaces in a new complex in the Portlaoise-Midlands prisons.  Those are the medium-term plans.  The long-term project is the complex at Thornton Hall.I was not directly involved in negotiating the purchase of the land at Thornton Hall.

I am not in a position to say the timescale until I get Government approval.  If I do, Deputy Rabbitte will be the first to hear the timescale.In view of the prevailing current and future economic circumstances, we are building Thornton Hall on a more realistic basis.  In my own view and the view of the officials who advise me on prison numbers, the prison should be built on a phased basis.  We will provide another 200 places in Wheatfield, probably in September, and another 300 when the extra prison spaces are built in the midlands complex.  Ultimately, we will be building — we estimate on a three phase basis — up to 1,400 prison cells with a capacity of 2,200 within the Thornton Hall complex.

When the Labour Party was in government we handed over to his party a solvent country creating 55,000 jobs a year with the public finances in surplus.  His Government will leave to us a bankrupt country that is going down the tubes and cannot provide money for necessary prison spaces or anything else.  Is that not the degree of economic mismanagement by Fianna Fáil in the past seven or eight years?

The record of Deputy Rabbitte's party is that one of its first decisions in Government was to stop the prison building programme.  In 1997, because there was a crisis in the prison building situation, we started a prison building programme.  One cannot build prison spaces overnight.  It takes time.The tender process for the PPP was entered into on the basis of confidentiality and Department of Finance guidelines, to which we must adhere.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	392	My first concern as Minister for Justice and Law Reform is public safety.  In that regard the fact that the number of serious criminals behind bars serving two years' imprisonment or more increased by over 600 between 2007 and 2009 is a cause of commendation of the Garda Síochána whose vigilance has resulted in the arrest and successful prosecution of these offenders.  This trend has been continuing in 2010.This sudden and unexpectedly large increase has, however, put a lot of pressure on the prison system and there will be problems before sufficient new prison spaces can be constructed and brought into operation.  I emphasise that more than 80% of the sentenced prisoner population in custody are serving sentences of 12 months or more.  It would, therefore, be grossly misleading to suggest that overcrowding is caused by imprisonment of minor offenders or that the problem can be resolved overnight by greater use of alternatives to custody.The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997, close to 1,800 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the midlands and Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  By any standard this is a significant level of investment aimed at modernising and enhancing the facilities we can provide to our prison population.Current projects will see in excess of 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new block in Wheatfield.  Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approximately 50 spaces later this year.  In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise-Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.The Government is fully committed  to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin, to replace the entire Mountjoy Prison campus.  The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.  The development is now proceeding on a phased basis and will, I believe, provide accommodation that is comparable with best international practice.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	393	We on this side of the House have raised this issue continually over the past 18 months.  The crisis was flagged to the Minister and I remind him of his comments in September 2009 on the publication of a most damning report on the Irish prison system by Judge Michael Reilly, the inspector of prisons.  Judge Reilly spoke about prisons being dangerous and unsafe.  In response, the Minister said numbers in Mountjoy Prison would be kept below 600, in so far as that was practicable.  The current data on bed capacity in Mountjoy show prisoner numbers to be in excess of 70 above the dangerous level, as estimated by Judge Reilly.Does the Minister regard it as acceptable that inmates in Mountjoy are sleeping on benches, in large communal cells, in offices and in the reception area?  Prisoners are occupying the shower areas in the basement of the prison.  Mountjoy is in a most dangerous condition not only for prisoners, but for the staff working on a full-time basis.  It is inhumane and unacceptable to have prisoners sleeping in a sitting-up position because of overcrowding and lack of space.I ask the Minister, notwithstanding what he said in response to Deputy Rabbitte's question about Thornton Hall, that this crisis should not await developments in Thornton Hall, dates unknown.  He mentioned extra prison space in other parts of the country but both he and his Department are oblivious to what is needed as root and branch reform of the role and function of our prisons because of the adherence of this and successive Governments over the years to the Victorian concept of prison in society.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Despite the perception the Deputy sometimes peddles, we are not putting girl guides into prisons.  More than 80% of those in prison are there for sentences of 12 months or more.  They are not people languishing in prison who should not be there.  Dangerous people are in prison who should not be on the streets.  There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers going into prison, a result, it must be said, of increased Garda activity, longer custodial sentences and increased court activity.  The significant increase in the number of persons being committed to prison since 2007 with sentences of two or more years in prison is driving up the prison population.  This situation relates mainly to people who are being convicted in the Circuit Court, not the District Court.  The majority of those convicted in the Circuit Court relate to very serious crimes involving property, drugs and firearms.  There has been a modest increase in the use by judges of longer sentences but only 60% of those found guilty in the Circuit Court receive a prison sentence.  However, there has been a most significant increase in the total number of cases being brought before and processed in the Circuit Court, which again suggests these are serious criminals or people being convicted of serious offences.Although there is a difficulty in our prisons in that there is slightly above 100% capacity, one may compare this figure to Belgium at 125%, France at 131%, Italy at 130% and Spain at 141%.  I was in Mountjoy Prison some weeks ago and although what I saw was an old prison — that is one of the reasons the Government decided to build a new prison at Thornton Hall — some of the stories I have heard and some of those the Deputy peddled in the House today do not bear up.

I spoke to the new Governor and can assure the Deputy that the situation that pertained previously will no longer pertain in that prison because I am assured by the new Governor and management that changes will be and are being made there in the way the prison is being run.Since the Deputy gave those figures of 70 above the suggested limit of 600 spaces a new block has been opened in Mountjoy Prison where more than 50 people have taken up occupancy.  When I was there I saw none of what was mentioned.  I had free rein of the prison and complete freedom to speak to any prisoner.  Prisoners came up to me and spoke and none of them complained of the conditions.  One prisoner said that as far as he was concerned the situation was "reasonable", in the circumstances.

He was the only person who raised any issue of accommodation with me.  Nobody raised accommodation in an adverse way.I strongly suggest to the Deputy, and to Deputy Rabbitte, that they be reasonably objective and perhaps go to Mountjoy.  I invite them to do so to see the situation there.  That said, as a Government we accept it is not right that a prison should be in a city centre location.  That is why we made the decision we did.  It should be on the periphery of the city, in order to ensure that egress and ingress of materials are stopped.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	409	——I find it astounding that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform should come to the House and say he met a prisoner who said, "Minister, everything is all right here", that he should accept that and place it on the record of this House over and above the comments of Mr. Justice Michael Reilly who stated last September that the situation in Mountjoy was unsafe and dangerous.I put it to the Minister that as well as the overcrowding of which he speaks, as do we, the figures actually speak for themselves.  The situation is exacerbated and the entire criminal justice system brought into disrepute when there are 940 inmates, or 18% — almost one in five — of the prison population currently at large, on temporary release for no other reason than there not being sufficient prison space in the form of accommodation to house them.I ask the Minister to accept there is a crisis under his watch.  He does himself and his Government no service by saying in this Chamber that he met a prisoner in Mountjoy who said, "Keep it up, it's reasonable.  Everything is all right".  The Minister is refusing to accept there is a crisis of unprecedented scale in the prison system, with almost one in five prisoners out and 11 of the 15 custodial institutions of the State currently experiencing overcrowding to an unprecedented degree, giving rise to a situation where the independent inspector of prisons, a judge of some repute, nine months ago, before the crisis became as bad as it now is, is on record as saying Mountjoy is unsafe and dangerous.  The Minister is happy with the situation.

I accept as valid that there is a difficulty in our prisons.  Clearly, if there is over 100% occupancy there is a difficulty.  Since 1997 when my party came to Government we have built 1,800 spaces which stands in comparison to anything that came previously.  We continue to do that.  The situation in Mountjoy Prison is not as bad as people make it out to be.  Ultimately, I accept the best solution is to get out of Mountjoy to the other centre in Thornton Hall but at every twist and turn, the people on the Opposition side objected to the building of Thornton Hall and tried to find every fault with it.  The Deputies opposite have some culpability in regard to this.

Family law in particular includes provisions to encourage spouses to resolve disagreements by way of mediation.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989, as amended, provides in sections 5 and 6 that both spouses' legal advisers must discuss with them the possibilities of reconciliation, of engaging in mediation to help effect a separation on an agreed basis, and discuss separating by agreement rather than by judicial separation.Proceedings may be adjourned in order to give the spouses the opportunity to consider reconciliation, or to agree terms of their separation, and communications concerning such a reconciliation or terms of separation between the spouses and a third party are inadmissible as evidence in subsequent proceedings.  Similar provisions are also contained in the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.Similar legislative provision is made for disputes about guardianship and custody of, and access to, children.  Part IV of the Guardianship of Infants Acts 1964, as inserted by the Children Act 1997, is framed to ensure that parties to a dispute concerning children are fully aware of the alternatives to guardianship, custody and access proceedings and encourages the parties to come to agreement.These legislative provisions are bolstered by the Family Support Agency's family mediation service.  The service provides mediation to separating couples.  The service is free, professional and confidential.  It enables couples, married and non-married, who have decided to separate or divorce, to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce with the help of a trained mediator.  As Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs,  I promoted the legislation that underpins the Family Support Agency.The Legal Aid Board also plays a role in promoting mediation.  The board has trained a large number of board solicitors and private solicitors in collaborative law.  This new form of mediation is a way of resolving family law matters including divorce, separation and parenting disputes.  I welcome the recent initiative of the board in considering ways to promote further the use of mediation.The courts are also actively encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution, whether in family law or otherwise.  County registrars have a range of functions and powers designed to ensure that court time and resources are used to optimum effect by ensuring, among other things, that the parties can deal with as many non-contentious issues as possible prior to a court hearing.In 2008, Circuit Court rules were introduced to empower a county registrar, inter alia,  to identify the issues that are in dispute between the parties.  A county registrar is also empowered to direct expert witnesses retained by the respective parties to consult with each other, and to require that the outcome of their consultations be recorded in a memorandum to be submitted to the county registrar and delivered to the parties, although the outcome of such consultations cannot bind the parties.Consideration is being given to providing that the county registrar should satisfy himself or herself from the case progression process that alternative dispute resolution options such as collaborative law or mediation had been considered, and so certify before sending the case forward for hearing.The Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provides expressly for mediation in personal injuries cases.  Section 14 provides that a court may direct the parties to a personal injuries action to meet in a mediation conference to discuss and attempt to settle a case.  I have made similar provision in the Multi-Unit Development Bill 2009 that is on Second Stage in this House, having been passed by the Seanad.  I look forward to the publication, in the near future, of the final report of the Law Reform Commission on the question of a more structured approach to mediation in the legal system.

Mediation could save the State up to €200 million.  Particular emphasis was placed on it in the McCarthy report, which is an aspect of the report about which we have heard very little.  I would have thought the Minister might have taken the opportunity to comment on it.The emphasis of the 1996 Law Reform Commission report on family law is placed on mediation rather than adversarial court structures.  Does the Minister see any role for himself in the promotion or assistance of a shift away from adversarial issues towards mediation?

We have done it for the Multi-Unit Development Bill 2009 by insisting on mediation and alternative dispute resolution as a statutory concept, in order to obviate the necessity for people to go to court.  Indeed, for disputes involving Government Departments, the State Claims Agency insists that mediation and alternative dispute resolution be used.  The Government is absolutely adamant that mediation will be used on every possible occasion.  We liaise with the Courts Service and the Judiciary to ensure that this is available to people who are consenting to this particular way of proceeding.

Putting more resources into the mediation side of family law would be in the interests of the taxpayer in the long term.  How frequently do we get cases in our clinics from people who find it very difficult to access the courts in this area?  I refer to waiting times, free legal aid centres and so on.  If the mediation services were available, they may obviate the necessity for resolution through the family courts.

That has since been underpinned by statute.  The Family Support Agency has premises in most of the major urban areas in the country and provides a free confidential mediation service to couples who are in dispute.  That is used regularly and is a significant reason many people no longer come to clinics or go to court, because they are using those services.This is also the case with the Legal Aid Board, where there are disputes that do not go to mediation.  A substantial effort has been made by those people involved in the legal aid system.  The board has trained solicitors who are involved in collaborative law and alternative dispute resolution in order to prevent people from having to open up their dispute in open court.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

It is not proposed to accept this amendment as the Bill, as it stands, does not require it.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I move amendment No. 1:In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:"6.—From the commencement of this Act any review of services, including those of any land and buildings, at Saint Luke's Hospital, must be laid before the Dáil and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children by the Minister for approval.".I do not wish to delay the House unduly on this amendment.  We discussed this issue at a meeting of the Select Committee on Health and Children.  I proposed that I would table an amendment on this matter for Report Stage.  I want to read into the record what I said on this matter at the Select Committee on Health and Children.  I said:I will table an amendment on Report Stage to have any review of services or new plans for St. Luke's Hospital brought before the committee by the Minister.  This would allow members to have their say and act on the basis of full information.I also make another point which is not relevant to this matter.  I will cite, for the benefit of the Minister of State as the Minister for Health and Children is not here, what the Minister said in reply.  She said: "I am happy to agree to Deputy Reilly's suggestion."  Therefore, I am somewhat surprised to see amendment No. 2, which does not reflect what I sought, unless amendment No. 2 is to be subsumed into the amendment I tabled.  The difference between the Minister's amendment and the proposal I highlighted clearly on Committee Stage, to which the Minister agreed, is that any proposal for any changed uses of lands at St. Luke's would be laid before the Dáil and the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health and Children.The Minister's amendment states "the Executive shall use the land vested in it by this section for the purposes of the delivery of health and personal social services within the meaning of the Health Act 2004", but it does not stipulate, as I did in my amendment, of which I gave notice and to which the Minister agreed, that any proposal for any changed uses of the lands would be laid before the Oireachtas by the Minister.  The purpose of doing that is to allow the Oireachtas act on full information and to allow the people to see precisely what plans are being put in place before such plans are acted upon.  That is what democracy is supposed to be about.  It will not in any way tie the Minister's hands per se.  If the then Government were to have a majority on such a proposal, then it would have a majority, but at least the people of Ireland who have used this wonderful service would know of the proposal.We have all been at one in praising the service provided by St. Luke's, in particular, its ethos, the manner in which it looks after patients and their families in such a holistic fashion, and the great work done by the organisation, Friends of St. Luke's.  They all want to be assured that the people, as represented by their elected representatives through the Houses of the Oireachtas, will be able to have a say on what happens to St. Luke's Hospital.  That is reasonable.  I was very pleased that the Minister agreed to that proposal.  She said: "I am happy to agree to Deputy Reilly's suggestion."  I hope there will not be any rowing back from that position.I appeal to the Minister of State, in representing his senior Minister, to accept this amendment.  What I have said is true and it can be checked in the "blacks".  There is no question of my trying to in any way to twist what the Minister said.  What I cited is a direct quote from her from the record of the Committee Stage debate.I propose that this amendment be accepted.  I believe it will meet the concerns of many people who have used St. Luke's, are very proud of their association with it and who wish to see the wonderful ethos in it continue throughout our oncology services.I do not wish to end on a negative note but the reality is that the HSE does not have such an ethos and we are deeply concerned that the ethos in St. Luke's could be lost and equally that those lands and buildings could be lost.  We do not want to see that happen.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	453	Amendment No. 3 in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, states:In page 4, lines 29 to 31, to delete all words from and including "may" in line 29 down to and including "section" in line 31 and substitute the following:"may not dispose of any land (including buildings) vested in it by this section and must continue to use the land (including buildings) vested in it by this section for medical purposes related to the treatment of cancer in public patients in a manner and form determined by the Executive with the consent of the Minister".To translate that into vernacular English, we want to hold on to St. Luke's as a centre of cancer excellence; we do not want it to be sold.  If the Minister wants to sell it, she or her successor will have to bring such a proposal back to this House and make a persuasive case for it.  It is pretty simple.The Minister of State is not the senior Minister responsible and therefore he is not accountable for undertakings given by the Minister verbally in the Chamber.  Any verbal undertaken given by any Minister in any Administration is not worth the paper it is not written on.  For the Government to suggest, with the arrogance that only a tired Administration can command faced with an election in 2012, that it will not implement a decision in 2014 makes Robert Mugabe look like a reluctant tyrant.  Let us be realistic.  This Administration will not form the next Government, according to all the opinion polls.  To suggest instinctively, that I as Minister or that Deputy Harney as Minister would give a verbal undertaking that the Government would not be disposed to do as we seek indicates the reason for the Government parties' rankings in the polls and why the Minister's party has disappeared.I attended the opening of Lios na nÓg, a Gaelscoil in Cullenswood House last Monday.  I persuaded the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Treacy, when he was junior Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, in 1987, after much argument and persuasion, not to proceed with the firesale of Cullenswood House.  As the Minister of State may recall it was the birthplace of Scoil Éanna, the birthplace of the Gaelscoil movement and the birthplace of the school that Pádraic Pearse established in Oakley Road for the teaching of young people through the medium of Irish in the early part of the 20th century.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, listened to the arguments I put to him, namely, that this was a dilapidated building in poor condition.  The Office of Public Works then faced similar economic constraints and firesale conditions, although the conditions were not as bad as those now faced by the Minister of State's Department and the Government.  I advised the then Minister of State that the building was a building site and that little or no money would be secured from its firesale and that it would become an apartment block of anonymity and privacy.  He was persuaded by my argument.  Through a long process of preservation, consultation and gestation, having regard to the original purpose for which the building  was preserved or held on to by the Cullenswood House committee, the building was transposed into the provision of a new Lios na nÓg school beside Scoil Bhríde, which was one of the original Gaelscoileanna in this country.  President McAleese had the honour of opening that school less than ten days ago.  If the then Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, had not had that courage, which I hope the Minister of State possesses, we would not have had that celebration less than ten days ago.  This building would probably become an anonymous, badly built, speculatively constructed, apartment block, something of which Ranelagh does not need more.We have been told nothing will happen for another four years, until 2014.  The property market will probably have recovered in part by then but our economic circumstances will remain difficult.  The temptation to sell off this property in Dublin 6, as my constituency colleague, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, will concur, will be strong.  If it were to be sold off and the proceeds transferred to the Health Service Executive which would then provide an equivalent facility of the same quality in another location, I would be somewhat open minded though still not persuaded.  However, the idea of handing over that haven of calm, as one speaker described it on Second Stage, to the chaos of the HSE is beyond belief.The Minister of State's party will not be in government in four years' time.  He must not allow this facility to become the bureaucratic entitlement of the Department of Health and Children or the HSE, which is accountable to nobody.  In the case of the Department, we can at least see our public servants in the Chamber today.  Under the old system, some of us were members of health boards, possibly including the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  However, the HSE is like the KGB, with public representatives never seeing or meeting with its officials.  They do not answer our questions and are entirely unaccountable.If this legislation is passed in its current form, St. Luke's Hospital is gone.  If the Minister of State does not accept the Labour Party amendment, this vital facility is doomed.  Can he name another hospital anywhere in the country that could evoke the same degree of emotion, sympathy and support which the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital have been able to mobilise?  It is not simply a question of a feel good factor, as many mothers of children born in certain maternity facilities feel good about the process of having given birth there.  We are talking about something much more substantial.  We are talking about people who went through a journey which they may or may not have survived.  They and their families attribute their survival, or the calm acceptance of the alternative outcome, as being greatly assisted by the calm environment of St. Luke's Hospital.  Yet the Minister is going to substitute it for St. James's Hospital.  We are going to transpose St. Luke's Hospital and everything that surrounds it into the facility off St. Stephen's Street.  Who is in charge here?Once state-of-the-start medical practice has measured and identified what is wrong with an individual patient — Deputy Reilly is more familiar than I with what is involved in that — the course of therapy is outside the narrow confines of measured medical interventions.  There are other factors that cannot be measured but which contribute to the recovery or palliative care of patients.  Just because we cannot measure them does not mean they do not exist.  That immeasurable quality exists in St. Luke's Hospital, yet the Minister of State is going to let the HSE flog off the facility even though his party will not even be in government when it happens.  The Minister of State will regret, when he is in opposition in four years' time, that he did not have the courage to say he did not agree with the permanent officials of the Department of Health and Children or the monster that is the HSE.  A future Minister will have to come into this Chamber in 2014, stand where the Minister of State is standing today and persuade the House that it is a good idea.  It is certainly not a good idea in 2010.  Why is the Minister of State ceding to people in the HSE — people who never have to face election or accountability of any kind — the power to destruct a facility that has won the hearts and affections of hundreds of people throughout the State?  For whom and for what is that being done?  It is mind blowing.We have not made a success of the reorganisation of our health services; everybody in the House would agree with that.  There is much work to be done.  I am advised by people who know far more than I about the mechanics and science of medicine that national centres of excellence and the centralisation of cancer services is the best way forward.  I do not dispute that, but the reality is that we do not know everything.  What we do know, however, is that St. Luke's Hospital works.  Why impose a death certificate on this cancer treatment facility, which is what the Bill will do if our amendment is not accepted?  It is a death certificate with a time stop of four years.I have collected four boxes of petitions, which will be delivered to the Minister's office, from people throughout the country.  Deputy Creighton will concur that this is not simply a constituency issue.  St. Luke's Hospital is a national institution which happens to be located in the constituency of Dublin South-East, and the vast majority of the people who have petitioned me and Deputy Creighton do not live in the constituency.  This is not parish pump politics; it is a question of national solidarity with an institution that works and whose existence has evoked an extraordinary loyalty.  Yet the Minister of State wants to destroy it.  I urge him to accept our amendment.  If necessary, the Minister, Deputy Harney, can introduce the change in the Seanad.  I ask the Minister of State to do a "Noel Treacy" on this and save St. Luke's Hospital.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Our objective is to save the best aspects of our health services.  St. Luke's Hospital has indisputably played an enormous part in many people's recovery from cancer — people from throughout the country — over many years.  I say this in the context of being fully supportive of the cancer strategy.  Whenever we raise issues at the edge of the cancer strategy, the Minister disingenuously claims we are not supportive of the strategy itself.  That strategy is about centres of excellence; it is not about doing away with the elements of excellence that already exist in the system.  We are not arguing that St. Luke's Hospital should be a stand-alone centre of excellence.  Rather, we are arguing that it should be linked into one of the designated centres for the Dublin area while retaining its unique character and continuing the work it has been doing for generations.It is difficult to measure the positive benefits for people recovering from or undergoing treatment for an illness like cancer of the type of atmosphere offered by St. Luke's Hospital.  A substantial body of research suggests that one's state of mind, one's environment and the way is which one is treated all contribute significantly in terms of recovery and response to treatment.  Those elements are uniquely available at St. Luke's Hospital in a way they are not in the large acute hospitals that have been designated as cancer centres.We are not suggesting that diagnosis or surgery should be available in St. Luke's Hospital, we are suggesting that there is a role for it to be attached to one of the other centres.As health spokesperson for the Labour Party, I would hate to have been involved in throwing out all of the good elements of our health service to fit it into a straitjacket-style strategy; that is why I am arguing this point even though I support the core of the Minister's strategy with regard to providing excellence in cancer treatment, where we do not do everything all over the place, which was the reality in the past and which needed to be addressed.  This is different, it is about preserving something unique and special that could not be reconstructed.There is protection until 2014 in the legislation and on Committee Stage when I tabled this amendment, the Minister appeared sympathetic to our arguments and said she would come back with a positive amendment.  Initially, when I read the amendment she tabled, I thought she was responding to what we had raised.  When we look at the detail of the amendment, however, it is subject to subsection (5) — that the executive must use it for the purposes of the delivery of health and personal social services.  That subsection states that the executive may not without the consent of the Minister sell, exchange, let or otherwise dispose of any land vested in it by this section.  If that is turned around the other way, with the Minister's consent, the executive can sell St. Luke's Hospital.  That is why the amendment is meaningless, it simply restates the contents of that subsection, it does not deliver what it promises at first reading.  It does not give any reassurance beyond 2014 that St. Luke's will be retained for health services.Also, the Minister's amendment relates to general health services while ours relates specifically to cancer.  I am not satisfied with the Minister's amendment despite the fact that on Committee Stage she seemed to take on board what we were saying.The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, might be able to offer a more holistic response on this issue.  My experience of debating with the Minister for Health and Children on these issues is that for her it is about winning the debate, not about the health issue.  I am trying to get agreement on the unique contribution of St. Luke's Hospital and how to preserve that into the future without in any way interfering with the cancer control strategy.There is no reason there could not be a centre in the hospital that does not offer surgery or diagnosis but that offers the sort of unique atmosphere in which follow-up treatment can be continued, such as specialist supervision under the auspices of the cancer control programme.  That is what I envisage for all patients who will need these services, as well as for those families who are currently involved in treatment and want to ensure we maintain what we have.We can develop strategies that look great on paper, and which deserve our support, but there are elements that are unique and different that can contribute something extra, which is what St. Luke's Hospital does through its ethos.  I do not see any reason why that cannot be incorporated within the strategy.I ask the Minister to keep an open mind on this and to listen to the arguments of the Opposition and the voices of the public we are responding to on this issue.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and I acknowledge the work done by Deputies O'Sullivan, Reilly and, in particular, my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinn in pursuing this issue and offering a reasonable solution to the challenges facing us in this legislation.I am pleased the Minister is here.  I accept and understand this is a busy period from a legislative point of view but it is regrettable that legislation is being rammed through.  Two weeks ago, there was a week where there no votes, no legislation of any substance and a week where the Government was completely unaccountable, wasting the time of Opposition Deputies, when legislation such as this could have been taken and we could have dealt with it in depth.I do not want to give a Second Stage speech but I have profound concerns about the HSE.  It is a failed entity and the transfer of the assets, resources and board of St. Luke's Hospital to it is a fundamental error.  St. Luke's Hospital has worked for decades, since the early 1950s, but it will be broken if it is subsumed into the monster that is the HSE.As an Opposition Deputy who has only been here for three years, it is depressing to see Opposition Members putting forward constructive amendments to improve legislation, as we did on Committee Stage last week, only to see Deputies from the Government side coming into the committee to vote against them without having even listened to the debate.  That is precisely what happened last week and I presume it will happen again today.  I regret that.There are two substantive amendments.  The first was tabled by the Labour Party last week — and I support it completely — to secure the land and buildings of St. Luke's Hospital for public health care use, particularly cancer treatment.  Deputy Reilly has also proposed an amendment that I understood from the Minister's comments on Committee Stage she would be willing to accept, that in the event the Labour Party amendment is not acceptable, the Minister would put in place a safeguard that would oblige the Minister to appear before the Dáil and the committee to detail any future changes to St. Luke's Hospital.  It now appears neither of these propositions is acceptable to the Government for some reason.I reiterate to the Minister that Deputy Reilly, during his contribution on Committee Stage, said that he would table an amendment on Report Stage to have any review of services or new plans for St. Luke's Hospital brought before the committee by the Minister.  This would allow Members to have their say and to act on the basis of full information.  In response to that, the Minister for Health and Children replied that she was happy to agree to Deputy Reilly's suggestion.  The Opposition Members present took that in good faith; unfortunately, it is not observed or being put forward in a substantive way in the amendment proposed by the Minister.  As pointed out by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, it is essentially an enabling provision which states that subject to the approval of the Minister the spirit of the proposal can be overridden.  This is very unfortunate.I accept that the Minister speaks in good faith when she states that she wishes to see the lands of St. Luke's preserved and used long into the future for the public health service.  Most of us on the Opposition benches would like to see them committed to cancer care services.  Unfortunately, the Minister's word will not be binding.  Her word will not be enough if and when there is a change of government, and who knows who will be the future Minister for Health and Children.  Unless it is written and woven into the legislation there will be no safeguard for St. Luke's Hospital.  I concur with the point made by Deputy Quinn that St. Luke's Hospital will be given away and will no longer have the protection of legislation if the Bill is carried by the House today, even with the amendment proposed by the Minister.  That would be unfortunate.It is fair to state that while St. Luke's Hospital is located in my constituency, it provides a national service and has done so for many years.  It would be a sad day for the health service, cancer care and the tens of thousands of people who have benefited from the service through the years if either the Labour Party amendment or the Fine Gael amendment is rejected in the Chamber today.  I appeal to the Minister to think carefully and to consider accepting one or other of the amendments proposed by the Opposition in good faith.  It would stand to the Minister in the spirit of co-operation and trying to secure the best possible outcome for the hospital and its patients.

That is something with which I strongly disagree.  I also disagree with it because it is part of a flawed plan on the provision of radiation oncology throughout the State that will see entire communities and regions north of a line from Dublin to Galway discriminated against, including the constituency that I represent in the House, namely, Cavan Monaghan.I support amendment No. 1 as far as it goes and I fully and enthusiastically endorse amendment No. 3.  The very least that can be done if the Bill is to be passed today is to ensure that the lands and buildings of St. Luke's remain in use for the provision of cancer — and I emphasise cancer — health services after 2014.  I wish to stress further that this should be for public health services as the amendment tabled by Labour Party colleagues clearly states.  I want to lay emphasis on this because it is a very important point.There will be legitimate concern as to the future of the buildings at St. Luke's and the site if it is left in the hands of the HSE with the approval of any Minister in the future as to what purpose or service it will be put.  In my view, it should not only be with regard to health and personal social services as the Minister's approach suggests.  It should be particular to the continuation of the treatment of cancer patients and in the public health service.As I have stated on many occasions, the Minister and the Government have pursued a policy of health privatisation and a tax on public provision.  I fear that, whether she and it be at the helm when any future decisions are taken, once the position is provided for the HSE will present a case to a future Minister and Government seeking approval for the disposal of these lands or their employment in some other purpose.  That is unacceptable.As I stated on Second Stage, last year I had the sad experience of attending in St. Luke's my brother-in-law who died — a younger man than me.  While everyone does not have happy outcomes, there is no question as to the care and special location.  I stated on Second Stage that I found the experience of visiting at St. Luke's, distressing though it is for any of us who are family members watching a loved one in such a deteriorating condition, a new hospital experience.  I have an abiding memory of it, which concurs with the case put by other voices this afternoon and over a protracted period of time in support of the continuation of St. Luke's for the particular and wonderful place it is.Amendment No. 2 from the Minister is absolutely inadequate, as will be clear from what I already stated.  It is still subject to section 6(5) of the Bill, which would allow the HSE to dispose of the St. Luke's premises and lands with the approval of the Minister of the day.It was signalled last year — and I asked for clarification because it has not been asked so far — that after 2014 St. Luke's would continue to be used as a cancer care facility.  I refer specifically to the remarks of the chair of the hospital board, Padraic White, who stated as such as I recall.  Will the Minister or Minister of State — whoever is replying — confirm that the chair of the hospital board, Padraic White, made that commitment?In support of amendment No. 1 and, in particular, of amendment No. 3 and in rejection of amendment No. 2, St. Luke's is rightly regarded as a unique hospital facility in the Irish hospital and health care experience.  It is worthy of special mention and a special case, even with the Minister's ongoing intent with the roll-out of her cancer care plan.  Its quiet atmosphere and peaceful surroundings all contribute greatly.  I wish to pay tribute to the particular care provided by the most important resource of all that I noted during my visits last year, which is the excellent staff.

I have watched it before.The Deputy appealed to me to show courage.  I wonder if courage is all about supporting the popular thing in the constituency or if it is about supporting what is laid down in the national cancer strategy.  I would like to show the Deputy that having knowledge of St. Luke's Hospital is not confined to Dublin Deputies.

He explained he knew about the peace and tranquillity of the hospital.  I know it quite well as my aunt died there some years ago.  The Deputy has a habit of thinking that Fianna Fáil Deputies are lesser beings or representatives.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	465	For a number of years I have considered the question of supporting best practice and what is best for the patient.  When the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, selected the hospital in the next county to me in Tullamore for the national cancer strategy, as opposed to my hospital I, along with four councillors in Laois, were the only people to support the next county.  Therefore, I do not need a lecture in courage or doing the right thing.When we debated this issue, one would imagine that all of the health professionals were opposed to the Government proposals.  Yet, I read about the support for Professor Tom Keane and Professor Donal Hollywood, whom we hold up to be some of the most reputable experts in the area of cancer treatment and who support the Government's proposals.  The Friends of St. Luke's Hospital are due to meet the Minister on 9 July.  I would have thought it would have some input into what future it holds for the hospital.I am not interested in where I will be in three or four years' time; I am discussing the current health strategy as best practice.  I have to take issue with comparing the KGB and the HSE.  I am not sure how often Deputy Quinn attended the meetings in this House in the audiovisual room held by the HSE.  It came in on many occasions but the meetings were disbanded because so few Deputies attended them.  I see no connection whatsoever between the KGB and the HSE.  In fact, I fully support what the HSE is doing.The HSE was set up to try to bring unity of purpose to the delivery of health services, which is what we support.  We want to see it happen and I see it happening in the national cancer strategy.  Some have been selective in suggesting that I support the amendments which ignored the national cancer strategy proposals for best practice.  I do not see the connection and that is why I fully support the Minister.  I also support everything she has done in terms of the national cancer strategy.On the commitments made by the Minister, no Member of this House can single out any commitments she made over the years upon which she has reneged.  The issue of the sale of St. Luke's Hospital was the Deputy's main point.  There is no intention to sell it off, a point which has been made clear by the Minister on Committee Stage and previously.  It could not be sold in future without the permission of the Minister for Health, regardless of who that will be.  Therefore, I do not see how it can be an issue for the Minister.To return to amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, it is important to reiterate what the Minister said on Committee Stage and subsequently.  As we know, radiotherapy services will continue at St. Luke's Hospital until 2014.  The Minister stated on Second and, I understand, Committee Stages that it is her intention that the site will continue to be used for healthcare purposes in the future.  I can understand the media coverage is showing some concerns about the future use of the land and buildings of St. Luke's Hospital.  There are concerns that there may be an intention to sell off the site.In response to the amendment tabled by Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan, the Minister reiterated on Committee Stage that it is her intention that St. Luke's Hospital should continue to be used for healthcare purposes after 2014.  It is built into the Bill and will be considered when radiotherapy services cease at the hospital.  On amendment No. 1 tabled by Deputy Reilly, it is the Minister's view that it is not an appropriate way to address the concerns that have been raised or to provide any guarantees about the future uses of the hospital.  It would lead to an unwieldy decision making process that will not provide any certainty about the future of St. Luke's Hospital.On amendment No. 3, the Minister does not consider it appropriate that the use of the site should be restricted to a specific aspect of healthcare, such as cancer care, as is proposed.  Therefore, it is not proposed to accept amendment No. 1 or amendment No. 3.  I refer to Committee Stage and Second Stage in the Dáil, on which the Minister was clear that her intention was that the site should be used for any purposes other than the provision of health services.  In this regard, the board of the hospital, in conjunction with the Friends of St. Luke's hospital, has commissioned a report on the best use of the facility and until that is received and there is an opportunity to engage with the various parties involved, the Minister does not wish to be prescriptive on this Bill.On Committee Stage the Minister stated that she would reflect on the concerns raised about the use of St. Luke's Hospital site for public health facilities before Report Stage.  Accordingly, I propose that amendment No. 2 is accepted by Deputies.  The Minister believes the amendment will address the concerns the Deputies have expressed on the future use of St. Luke's Hospital after 2014 when radiotherapy services cease.Section 6 addresses concerns about the future use of the site by explicitly requiring the consent of the Minster for any disposal of the land.  However, the Minister acknowledges the concerns which remain and proposes this amendment to bring certainty and clarity to the position.  As a result of this amendment the Bill will explicitly provide that the hospital site will be used by the HSE for the purposes of providing health and personal social services in line with the Health Act 2004.  I ask Deputies to support the amendment.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I remind the Minister what I and Deputy Creighton have already told the House and her words to me when I said I would table an amendment on Report Stage to have any review of services or new plans for St. Luke's Hospital brought before the committee by the Minister.  This would allow Members to have their say and act on the basis of full information.  The Minister told me she was happy to agree to my suggestion.  I regret the Minister of State's belief that my amendment would serve no purpose.  It sets out its purpose clearly.  There is no benefit in reiterating it if the Minister chooses not to hear it.The Minister of State also said that he had never known the Minister to renege on her word.  Unfortunately, that does not fit with reality.  The cervical cancer vaccine and the cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's which we were promised would be built this year were not delivered.  There was a co-located hospital policy that was to fast-track 1,100 beds into the system five years ago which it still to give us a bed, have a sod turned or a brick put in place.  I understood we had agreement on this.  I know the Minister agreed to it because it is on the record of the House for the Select Committee on Health and Children.  I can do little other than remind her what she said.  I can only appeal to her to see the benefit of what we proposed, namely, to allow the people to have their say in any future review of the services, buildings and plans for St. Luke's Hospital.I fully subscribe to the Labour Party amendment.  It was defeated at the Select Committee on Health and Children.  This is a compromise which I again remind the Minister she agreed to at the meeting.  I can only lay my case before the House and let others be the judge.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I have listened with interest to what the Minister of State said.  I regard any person elected in this republic and to this assembly as an equal citizen with the same mandate.  There are no first or second division Deputies, irrespective of what party they belong to or if they belong to none.  If what I might have said or the way in which I said it suggested that I did not so believe, that is not the case.  I do believe, however, that just as the KGB was the secret service in the Soviet Union, the HSE in the way in which it relates to directly elected Members is the secret service of our health system because we do not get answers.  I was with Professor Drumm in the Alexander Hotel when the best of things were promised and I had great hopes for that kind of response.  The reason I stopped writing to the HSE or attending those meetings is that they ceased to be effective.As my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has stated, we support the national cancer strategy.  We support the experts.  My Second Stage speech on this Bill did not challenge that.  I merely pointed out with a degree of humility and on behalf of this generation of human beings that we do not know everything.  The things we can measure are not all we can experience and the calm haven of St. Luke's to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred has benefited many people.  We are not seeking to change the national cancer strategy or its timetable.  All we want is to add a belt and half a brace to the legislation, which will only become active in 2014 — who knows what will prevail by then — so that the decision making process will be delayed to allow the continued delivery of a residue of cancer treatment in the calm haven of St. Luke's.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I wanted to be here earlier but I was taking the prescription charges legislation in the Seanad.  When that debate concluded I came to the Dáil, although I do not mean to imply I have no confidence in the capacity of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to address the issues arising.  I wish to make some remarks for the record because I have grown weary of Opposition Deputies constantly saying they support the cancer control programme only to criticise specific parts of it.Four years ago, 32 hospitals performed breast cancer surgery in Ireland.  In one instance, a surgeon carried out a single procedure in a year.  This was totally unsafe and it produced bad outcomes for patients and the health care system.  We have changed these practices after asking a group of 23 people, of whom 19 were clinicians, from this country and abroad to investigate the best international practices which this country should follow in organising its cancer services.  This group made recommendations which were endorsed by the Government.  A group under Professor Hollywood was established specifically to examine radiation oncology.  The report of the group recommended that radiation oncology should not stand alone from other cancer services.   An evaluation was conducted of all the facilities, including St. Luke's.  The evaluation committee, which comprised nominees from the National Institutes of Health in the United States, the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology and a radiation oncology institute in the UK, gave the following scores: St. Luke's, 3,965; St. James's, 8,897; St. Vincent's, 8,497; and Tallaght, 7,484.All hell would break loose in this House if I moved a facility that received a score of 8,000 to one with a score of 3,900.  I would be rightly told, as I was during Private Members' business last night, that I did not put patients first.  A motion has been put before the House which asks us to establish a new authority that would put patients first, yet every clinician who works solely in the public system favours this approach, as do the Irish Cancer Society, Europa Donna and every other patient advocacy organisation I have encountered.I fully acknowledge that St. Luke's has a terrific reputation and I want to preserve its ethos.  Until relatively recently radiation oncology could be administered only in St. Luke's.  Members of all our families have been given a fantastic service at the hospital.  Health care moves on, however, and developments in cancer care are revolutionary as well as evolutionary.  We either go with the pace of change in order to achieve better outcomes for patients based on evidence or we stay fixed in time and deliver less.  Neither I, as Minister for Health and Children, nor the Government is prepared to take the latter option.I made the remarks to which Deputy Reilly referred in the context of a Bill which at the time lacked provision to maintain public health services at St. Luke's.  I have now come forward with an amendment because my word was not trusted.  Since this decision was made, I have stated it was never intended to use St. Luke's for any purpose other than public health because, God knows, we have relatively few facilities close to the centre of Dublin and its growing population.  Instead of giving my commitment to discuss the issue in committee, I am writing it into the legislation.  How much stronger could I be?Do not pretend I am reneging on my word because I do not renege on the policies I make.  We were required to put the cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's to public tender but the company which came first was not in a position to make the tender bankable.  I am confident that a successful tender will be found shortly.  I do not choose who constructs these projects but I stand over the policies I make.  I accept the cervical cancer vaccine was delayed for financial reasons but all the girls who were affected in that year are being covered.  The programme was delayed but it was not reneged on and the Deputy needs to use his language carefully.I know that patients have had a happy experience in St. Luke's and many of them are sad and, in some cases, emotional about what is happening.  However, all the clinical expertise we could assemble, both from within this country and from abroad and including an expert of Professor Keane's global reputation in radiation oncology, supports what we are doing.  I do not wish to ring fence the future use of the facility for cancer treatment because it could also serve palliative patients.  Not all palliative patients are cancer patients.  Perhaps it could incorporate a long-term care facility.  Prospectus is producing a report for the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital and we will engage honestly with regard to the future use of the hospital.  I had thought a guarantee that it will be used for public health services would be good enough for the Deputies opposite and I am sorry that is not the case.The decisions taken by the Government were based on the best clinical expertise we could assemble from within this country and abroad.  The three nominees from the aforementioned institutes, along with two doctors from Ireland, evaluated all the submissions and scored them accordingly.  We may not like the scores but we must be prepared to accept them.  For that reason, I am not in a position to reverse my decision or to maintain what is broadly known as a stand-alone radiation oncology facility at St. Luke's beyond 2014.  As I want to maintain the hospital's ethos and name, the new unit at Beaumont or St. James's will be called the St. Luke facility.  However, this issue is about more than just a name because we are focused on achieving the best outcomes and care for our cancer patients.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Once again the Minister is distorting what Opposition Deputies have said.  I previously stated that we did not believe 32 hospitals should carry out surgery and we completely supported her decision in that regard.  She should not shake her head because I want the same respect as the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, demanded.  We are entitled to this respect as public representatives.We are not insisting on maintaining St. Luke's as a stand-alone radiation oncology unit.  I am sick and tired of having my words distorted when I speak about cancer in this House.  As Labour Party spokesperson on health, I support the national cancer strategy but we are trying to maintain St. Luke's as a facility for the treatment of ailments related to cancer in public patients in a manner and form to be determined by the HSE with the consent of the Minister.  That language is open enough to allow other forms of palliative care if that is what she desires, although I doubt she will still be Minister when this provision comes into effect.  I do not want my words distorted.  I support the concept of excellence and the type of strategy enunciated by the Minister.  However, having moved surgery, certain diagnostics and other services from Sligo to Galway, the Minister agreed, following talks she and Professor Keane had with people in Sligo, that patients could have subsequent care provided in Sligo General Hospital in a safe manner.  Why is a similar position not allowed in the case of St. Luke's Hospital?  Why can the hospital not be linked into one of the Dublin centres of excellence?  What is the difference between St. Luke's Hospital and Sligo General Hospital?

For my part, my voice is perhaps unique among all the voices in the House in saying that I am not happy with the Minister's cancer plan, as I will describe it.  As I stated before the Minister took her seat, it discriminates against the community I represent and people of all regions north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  The Minister will be familiar with the axis from Dublin to Galway but there is another part of the country north of it where people are no less deserving of cancer services at locations in the north west and north east.  The current and intended arrangements fall far short of what is required.There is also potential for real and imaginative cross-Border co-operation.  I do not believe the current signalled exodus of people from Donegal to Belfast comes in any way close.I disagree with the Minister's proposal on St. Luke's Hospital.  The Bill, as drafted, will remove the hospital and the adoption of amendment No. 2, in the Minister's name, will not alter a scenario which will present whereby St. Luke's Hospital will be employed in a non-related, non-cancer area in the HSE or, worse, sold off, perhaps even to fund the working budgetary needs of the HSE in future.The Minister has failed to take on board the critical concerns of Members.  I commend amendment No. 3.  The reason I refer specifically to this amendment is it leaves the door open for the decision to be taken on the future of St. Luke's Hospital in a clear and positive manner in relation to cancer care provision and in the public health service network.  This is the future that those of us on this side of the House and many more people the length and breadth of the State and beyond want to see.  The issue is not simply a local constituency matter because St. Luke's Hospital has all too sadly been very much part of the family experiences of too many families up and down the length of the State over many years.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	476	Sligo General Hospital serves a catchment population of 250,000.  Information has come to light showing that University College Hospital Galway has inadequate facilities to deal with the overflow from Sligo.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position given that the facility being closed in Sligo General Hospital is being duplicated in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The decision has created difficulties and has had a negative impact.I ask the Minister to reconsider the position in light of the palliative care, haematology services and medical care available at Sligo General Hospital, as well as the 4,000 mammograms carried out at the hospital each year, its catchment population of 250,000 and the information secured under freedom of information legislation last week — information that was concealed — which clearly indicates that the Galway centre of excellence was not in a position to proceed with the transfer of services from Sligo.The Minister indicated that two beds would be available at University College Hospital Galway for cancer patients from the catchment area of Sligo General Hospital.  We have discovered that only one bed is available for this catchment population of 250,000.  Is this not an indictment of a failed policy?Professor Keane who introduced the cancer control policy has left his post.  Accreditation was given to Sligo General Hospital and it was placed on a par with the best hospitals in the United States.  The HSE is closing down its cancer care facilities and recreating them at Letterkenny General Hospital.  Will the Minister reconsider the position in this regard?  The matter will not go away and if Fine Gael is in government the service will be reinstated at Sligo General Hospital in the shortest possible timeframe.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I am not opposed to the cancer strategy and, as I stated on Second Stage, I am not in a position to second guess the best medical experts on the roll out of cancer treatment.  A similar position applies in the case of most of my colleagues on this side.  That is not the point, however.  The issue here is one of preserving a facility specifically for public health services.  As the Minister correctly noted, there is major pressure and demand close to Dublin city centre.The issue before us is not only about preserving the name or ethos of St. Luke's Hospital but about preserving the site and buildings in Rathgar for the benefit of public health care long into the future.  My concern is not in any sense to try to debunk or detract from the national cancer strategy.  The Opposition parties are trying, in good faith, to ensure the site is secured.  We are concerned, however, that amendment No. 2 will not achieve that objective.  I take the Minister's words in good faith and I believe her statement during the Committee Stage debate last week that she is committed to preserving St. Luke's Hospital.  On that basis, she should be constructive and accept amendments Nos. 1 and 3 as alternatives to her amendment No. 2.

She said that the commitment on the cervical cancer vaccine was not reneged upon and merely delayed, and that all those who should have got it will get it.  I remind her of her original promise to the House, which was that everybody aged from 13 to 15 would get it.  Will they get it now?  No, they will not.  Girls who were 12 last year and are 12 this year will get it and those children who were 13, 14 or 15 years old 1.5 years ago will now not get it.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The Minister can wag her head all she wants.  Furthermore, she very conveniently neglected to mention her failed and utterly discredited co-location hospital policy.  Regarding cystic fibrosis, it is the Minister's duty not just to apportion funds, but also to ensure that those funds are used for the purposes for which they have been allocated and that tendering processes etc. are done in a way that result in the desired outcome that people expect.  However, that is not happening.  Because it is designed to be paid at the end, in the current economic climate I warrant that the Minister will have grave difficulty getting tenders to go through successfully.  In the meantime Irish citizens, many of them living in my constituency are being disadvantaged to the point where they die ten years younger than their counterparts in the North of Ireland do.  That is real.  It is real for Orla Tinsley who spoke from her hospital bed on radio this week.  We are not talking about theoretical situations here; we are talking about reality.The Minister now wants to deny her own words.  In direct response to what I said, the Minister now wants to revisit the context and change the context.  What she said is very simple.  She said: "I am happy to agree with Deputy Reilly's suggestion."  I read the suggestion into the record of the House twice and Deputy Creighton has read it in once.  The Minister can shake her head all she likes, but it is in black and white for the people to judge for themselves.  What little credibility she had is rapidly diminishing.The cancer strategy is not unlike the concept of the HSE.  The devil is in the detail.  There is nothing wrong with the concept of the HSE to provide health care for 4.2 million people.  However, the manner in which the Minister went about it, amalgamating ten health boards and a shared services unit without anybody being asked to take redundancy, with everyone guaranteed to keep his or her job and stay in the same job has led to the total dysfunctionality we have.  The chief executive officer, Professor Drumm, whom the Minister appointed, told our party before I even joined it that there were 3,500 people who did not even know what their jobs were.  Nobody in this House believes any longer in the ability of the HSE to look after children in care or run our health service.  It is completely discredited which is a terribly sad thing to have to say about the many excellent people who work in the HSE, in administration and medical-wise in nursing and many other areas.Let us consider the Minister's cancer strategy, with which I agreed in principle.  I have no problem with the centralisation of services for specialised treatment.  However, I object to her methodology and the very devious use of statistics to compare outcomes for breast cancer patients from the west coast vis-à-vis the east coast using figures for 2003-04 when there was no specialist in breast cancer, radiology specialising in mammography and pathology in Sligo.  As five years survival means five years, the figures from 2003-04 relate to 1998-99 before these people were present.  However, when the figures from 2007 relating back to 2002 are compared, they are every bit as good in the north west as they were on the east coast.The Minister allows private facilities in Dublin to act as satellites with hospitals in America, but she has an issue with Sligo General Hospital doing it with the University College Hospital in Galway, and yet she reproduces that model in Letterkenny.  It is the inconsistency and unfairness that bother people.  I wanted to address those issues as the Minister raised them.I wish to return to the core issue, which is that people have a deep concern about what will happen to St Luke's Hospital.  I support the Labour amendment, but I can understand the argument that it ties the Minister's hands.  My amendment allows us to revisit it in this House.  In the Minister's own words that was what she was happy to agree to.  However, something has happened in the interim and she wants to reframe everything.  For some reason unknown to me, she does not want to agree to what is an extremely reasonable compromise.

In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the potential yield of each of the following revenue raising measures:(a) requiring insurance companies to compensate the Minister for illness or disability payments where they have admitted liability and where the value of social welfare entitlements are deducted from the gross claim settlement;(b) changing Charge PRSI on rental income on PRSI classes A, B, C, D, E, H & S;(c) applying PRSI to capital gains on PRSI classes A, B, C, D, E, H & S;(d) applying PRSI to share based remuneration and share options on PRSI classes A, B, C, D, E, H & S;(e) withholding payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement until proof is provided that a bank has declined a payment-free period, an interest-free period, a partial write-off, an extension of the term, or any other reduction in the cost of the mortgage to the mortgage-holder and use the saving to improve the means-test for Mortgage Interest Supplement and modernise the rules including the deletion of the “30 hour rule”.”.The purpose of this amendment is to propose a number of revenue-raising measures.  As I said on Committee Stage, I thought the Minister would be able to identify some of these areas in which savings can be made.  At a time when there are such pressures on the social welfare budget, and certain people are calling for cuts to be made in pensions and other social welfare payments, it is important for the Minister to seriously consider alternative ways of raising revenue in his Department.In this amendment, I suggest five areas in which revenue can be raised.  Three of the proposals relate to types of income on which PRSI could be applied.  Certain categories of people do not currently pay PRSI on rental income.  Similarly, certain classes of people should be liable to pay PRSI on capital gains, share-based remuneration and share options.  I do not know why the Minister is not taking such an approach.  There is a need, on equity grounds, to extend the types of income on which PRSI is levied.  There is no reason it should be levied on earned income but not on income from capital, rent or shares.  There is very little consistency in the application of PRSI.  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed by and large with what I am suggesting.  I thought the Minister, having considered the matter further, would have tabled an amendment of his own on Report Stage, but unfortunately he has not done that.This proposal also relates to the compensation paid to those who receive illness or disability payments after an accident.  Due to the way the social welfare system operates, this is a subsidy to the insurance companies.  It does not make any sense whatsoever.  There should be an arrangement whereby payments made to the person who is covered under the insurance scheme can be recouped.  The insurance company should foot the bill in that regard.The final area where I see potential for revenue raising is the mortgage interest supplement.  This scheme is operating in a way that provides a subsidy to the banks.  The supplement is the first port of call for people finding it difficult to repay mortgages.  The banks should make the first concession or take the first step to assist someone who is in difficulty with mortgage repayments.  We know of many cases of irresponsible lending by financial institutions where people were overstretched and sometimes encouraged by their lending institution to overstate their incomes.  The first port of call should be the lending institutions.  They should be required to facilitate customers in rescheduling mortgages, taking breaks from mortgage repayments and negotiating new agreements.  That should happen first, before mortgage interest supplement kicks in.  Otherwise, if the supplement is paid without the banks playing any part in the resolution of a problem, the scheme simply amounts to the State, yet again, subsidising the banks.These are five reasonable proposals.  The Minister often asks us to come forward with proposals for revenue raising.  These are five areas where he could raise revenue within his Department.  I ask him to accept the amendment.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I particularly wish to speak on paragraphs (a) and (e) of the amendment, which deal with insurance companies and mortgage interest supplement.  I would also like a report from the Minister on the PRSI changes and the practicality of them.  Deputy Shortall is right.  The summer before last, an bord snip nua looked at cuts.  We do not seem to give the same emphasis to areas where savings can be made, because that would involve more work.  It is simpler to cut a certain percentage from payments to one parent families, child benefit, the blind pension or whatever.  A blanket quick decision can be made in those cases.  There is much less examination of other ways to save money.  Deputy Shortall’s proposal regarding insurance companies is a no-brainer, to use a horrible phrase, and there is a huge amount of sense in it.  During Question Time yesterday, we had a discussion on the mortgage interest supplement.  Every time someone comes to me with a mortgage difficulty, I am struck by how the mortgage interest supplement cheque goes straight to the bank.  It is a bank subsidy.  When the time runs out, as it does at different stages in different parts of the country, the mortgage holder is back to square one.  We need to see more negotiation with financial institutions beforehand.  There is no point in paying the supplement for a year, only to have customers lose their houses in any event.Mortgage interest supplement is vital as a bridge to allow people to hold on to their homes.  In that sense, I am supportive of it.  However, we need to examine how the financial institutions are using it.  They are now telling customers they will not renegotiate repayments until the customers have been granted mortgage interest supplement.  That is plainly wrong, particularly from institutions the Government is supporting.  Sub-prime lenders are the worst offenders in this regard.  This problem needs to be looked at because the supplement is costing €70 million this year.  That will probably rise, depending on what the Minister does in his review and the recommendations of the Cooney report.  It is important that this matter be examined.

On the insurance company issue, I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to begin the process of consultation on the question of requiring insurance companies to compensate the Minister for illness or disability payments where they have admitted liability and where the value of social welfare entitlements are deducted from the gross claim settlement.  However, as I also said on Committee Stage, it should be noted that such a system has been set up in the United Kingdom and that in 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 it raised £142 million and £138 million respectively.  Allowing that we are a similar jurisdiction and that Ireland's population is about one tenth that of the UK, it would indicate a saving here of approximately €14 million.  In a similar proposal, a figure of €88 million was mentioned.  I wish that amount could be raised, but it is unclear how that figure was arrived at.  I have given an undertaking to begin a process of consultation with the interested parties and I will honour that undertaking.With regard to the PRSI changes, Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance, in the 2010 budget, announced that it was his objective to introduce, in 2011, a new system of just two charges on income.  A universal social contribution would replace PRSI and the health and income levies.  In that context, those issues will be examined.  I thank Deputy Shortall for bringing them to my attention and I will feed her suggestions into the process.Regarding mortgage interest supplement, I told the House yesterday that we will be bringing the report on this matter forward in the next few weeks.  The Cooney report and the mortgage interest supplement report will come forward together.  We are at end game on this issue.  The kind of issue raised in the amendment is under consideration in that report.

Social welfare cuts are always applied this year.  There is always an excuse for not hitting the better off.  I do not accept what the Minister is saying.  These are firm proposals where savings could be made in the current year but he is refusing to do that.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	525	There is no proposal before us to do anything other than produce more reports.  With regard to the proposal in paragraph (e), we are only weeks away from having a report completed and published.  With regard to the proposals in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), a much more comprehensive look at the whole PRSI regime is being undertaken at present.  It is not true to say we find excuses not to hit the better off.  We raised many taxes in the last few years which were imposed on the day.  I am anxious to look at the whole PRSI issue.  We have 36 different rates of PRSI.  It could be simpler.  I like the direction the Deputy is suggesting we take.  We should make it simple and all encompassing.  This would allow for a low rate and mirror what the Minister for Finance said.  Given that entitlements are attached to PRSI, it is not a simple matter of bringing something in on the hoof.  However, this matter is already in train and the objective is to deal with it in 2011.With regard to the insurance companies matter in paragraph (a), a number of complexities are involved and I will begin the consultation process shortly.  It would not be possible to move on that without a full consultation process.

In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"3.—The Courts Service is required automatically to notify the Minister of upward or any changes in maintenance orders.".The purpose of this amendment is to provide for automatic notification of changes to maintenance orders by the Courts Service.This is information in the possession of the State which could have an impact on social welfare payments.  It should be an automatic matter, that when there is a change in maintenance order the Minister's Department is notified.  It seems perfectly straightforward and I hope the Minister supports the amendment.

I have been advised that the Courts Service is an independent body established under statute with five functions, namely, to manage the courts, provide support services for the judges, provide information on the courts system to the public, provide, manage and maintain court buildings and provide facilities for uses of the courts.  Family law is administered in camera and conveying information of the nature suggested would be in breach of that principle.In addition, the function suggested in the amendment could give rise to data protection issues without the party's consent.  The Courts Service is an independent provider of services to both parties in a case — in this instance, a civil family law matter.  An obligation of the kind suggested would involve the State in passing information to the State, namely, a third party, in respect of a case private to both parties involved.  In addition, increasing maintenance is paid, not through a District Court office but via bank transfer and, therefore, the Courts Service would not have information available on what moneys were paid over.In view of all those issues and those I mentioned previously, I will not accept this amendment.

Family law cases are held in camera  to protect the identities of the families involved.  Deputy Shortall’s amendment does not suggest that information be made available to the general public or that the in camera rule be breached in any way.  There has already been a great deal of discussion on this.  I was a member of the committee on the constitutional amendment on children, on which there was much discussion about the actual lack of reporting in family law cases.  I understand the Government has committed to look at that issue.  There have been reports by Carol Coulter both in this regard and concerning the difficulty that arises concerning the information vacuum on family law decisions.However, in terms of what is contained in this amendment regarding notification of the Department of Social Protection, there is no reason, if the will were there to implement it, the  in camera nature of family law cases should be breached in any way.  Only the maintenance aspect involved would go to a Department and none of it would go to the public.  The Minister may not be able to accept this today but from a practical perspective this is something that should be looked at.

Data matching can be a very useful tool in avoiding duplication of claims, fraud and so on.There may be very serious issues regarding data protection in this situation.  I will look at it.  The idea is a good and convenient one and the finances of the State could be protected.  However, I cannot accept the amendment today.  My understanding is there might be serious data protection issues and I could not accept such an amendment on the hoof.  I will investigate the matter further.

In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"3.—The Civil Registration Act 2004 is amended—(a) in section 19, by the deletion of subsection (6)(g),(b) by the deletion of section 22 and the substitution therefor of the following section:"22.—(1) This section applies without prejudice to the general duty on both parents to register a birth under section 19, whether those parents are married or not.(2) It shall be the duty of a parent whether married to the other parent or not, to furnish to the registrar particulars of the other parent.(3) Where a mother who is the informant for the purposes of section 19, gives particulars to the registrar of the father, those particulars shall be registered following the giving of notice to the person so named, unless he makes a claim, within such period as may be prescribed, that he is not father; and on the making of such claim the matter shall be referred by the registrar to the District Court for directions prior to the registration of the birth.(4) Where a mother who is the informant for the purposes of section 19 fails or refuses to furnish particulars of the father, or provides particulars that are false, misleading or incomplete, any person claiming to be the father of the child may at any time thereafter supply to the registrar or to any other qualified informant particulars regarding the father of the child, and the registrar shall register such particulars if the mother does not object to them within such time as may be prescribed; and in case of such objection the registrar shall refer the matter to the District Court for directions.(5) Where the father of a child has not been registered in respect of any child born before the commencement of section 7 of the Guardianship of Children Act 2010, or where, in respect of such a child, a mother who is the informant for the purposes of the Act of 2004 has provided particulars of the father that are false, misleading or incomplete, the father of the child may at any time after such commencement supply to the registrar particulars regarding the father of the child, and the registrar shall re-register the birth containing such particulars if the mother does not object to them or in case of objection shall refer the matter to the District Court for directions.".".The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the compulsory registration of a father's name on birth certificates.  This matter was examined in some detail by the joint committee which made a clear recommendation calling on the Minister to introduce such a system.  This system operates in many northern European countries.  It arises from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, regarding the right of the child to know and be cared for by both its parents.  At present, there is tendency among unmarried parents not to register the father's name.  It is or should be part of every person's birthright to know both parents and for that reason I propose we change the law to allow for the compulsory registration of the father's name.The other issue involved is the pursuance of fathers for maintenance and it would be of assistance if such details were provided.  It is standard practice in many other countries and is something towards which we should move in this country.  I ask the Minister to support the amendment.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Fine Gael supports this amendment.  The cost benefit is one aspect of it which is important because it would make things easier for the Department.  However, I support this principally from the perspective of the rights of the child to know  both its parents.  There are also genuine concerns which have been brought to my attention at different stages concerning the risk of children being in relationships with others who may be related to them and the corresponding need to know both parents' identities.  Unfortunately, this is a genuine concern at present.  This measure would go some way towards alleviating that concern.  The principal reason I support the amendment is the right of the child to know both parents.  I stated this on Committee Stage and reiterate it.The amendment mentions application "without prejudice" and it is important that this safeguard be there but I cannot think of a reason such a child should not be able to know the identity of its father.

It has invited submissions from interested parties and will issue recommendations in a further report which is not expected to issue before autumn of this year.The provisions contained in the amendment are premature, as any recommendation by the Law Reform Commission in regard to compulsory registration of the father's details on a birth certificate will be of considerable significance.  In the circumstances, it is considered best to await the outcome of the deliberations of the commission before considering legislation on the matter.The two Deputies made a very reasonable point but because we are so advanced in a process and because this is up for consultation it would be preemptive for me to move on this issue at this time.  I look forward with great interest to getting the report.  The arguments put forward have validity and when I receive the report the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, of which both Deputies are members, will discuss this matter further.  It has already done so.  I shall look at this issue at that time.

If he was prepared to go that far and say he agreed to the principle, that it was a matter of how this might be implemented and that he would take advice from the Law Reform Commission when it publishes its report, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment.  Does the Minister agree with the objective,  in principle?

I have not done very much study of this and perhaps there are overriding issues that will come forward when the Law Reform Commission reports as to why this should not be done.  Perhaps even the Deputy may find she will change her mind.There are two issues involved, as raised by the Deputy, namely, the right of a child to know who its father was or is and the ability of the State to seek maintenance.  There is the third issue which is medical, of people knowing their degree of consanguinity.  People might have sexual relations with a very close relative.  That is a serious issue and could be a potential time bomb in the future.  On all those grounds, and on the face of it, I have no difficulty.However, until somebody places all the facts in front of one it is difficult to make a final decision on anything.  I noted very carefully what the Deputy suggested.  There is a general measure of agreement and I hope the Deputy will accept that the logical thing to do is to wait for the report of the Law Reform Commission and see how we should proceed.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"3.—Section 198 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3D):"(3E) The payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable by a person in respect of his or her residence will be paid to this person on the day it is due according to the tenancy agreement of this person with their landlord.".".These three amendments relate to rent supplement.  They arise out of concerns expressed by a number of the housing agencies over recent years, especially Threshold.  That agency has been lobbying all parties with its concerns that are based on its first hand experience of dealing with tenants who are in rent supplement and who have identified serious problems with the way in which the scheme operates.  They have been campaigning for several years for these changes to be made.I had amendments to this effect last year and the year before as well.  The issues have been well aired and what is required is a political decision to make the changes.  It is in everybody's interest that these reforms be introduced to the rent supplement scheme.The first amendment relates to the timing of the payment of rent supplement.  Under current landlord and tenant legislation, a tenant is required to pay rent in advance.  All private tenants and landlords operate on that basis.  The rent for the month of July is paid on 1 July.  It is always paid in advance, but for some reason rent supplement is paid one month in arrears.  That does not seem to make any sense at all.  It means that the 95,000 thousand tenants on rent supplement are in breach of their tenancy agreement in law, because they are not paying their rent in advance.  That seems crazy.  It is an anomaly that needs to be corrected.The second amendment relates to the PPS details of landlords who are in receipt of rent supplement.  More than €500 million is currently being paid out to private landlords in rent supplement.  It seems absolutely ludicrous that this amount of public money is being paid out without any kind of assurance that there is adequate tax compliance on the part of the landlords.  This issue was identified a few years ago.  It was examined in close detail by the Committee of Public Accounts and we know it is currently wide open to abuse.  For many years, the Department did not even have a box on the rent supplement application form for the landlord's PPS number.  Strangely enough, it took some time to change that form.  From figures provided to us recently, we know that a small percentage of landlords provide their PPS number.  It was about 20% in April for applications made in 2009.  That is a fairly abysmal rate of compliance.  There is no point in continuing with a situation like this.The Minister for Social Protection cannot just wash his hands of the issue of tax compliance, given that his Department spends this amount of money every year.  He has a duty to compliant taxpayers to ensure that such money is paid out in a way that ensures there is a return for the taxpayer in terms of tax due.  The purpose of this amendment is to have a requirement that all tenancies be registered with the PRTB so that the circle could be closed.  Money would be paid out through rent supplement, but that would only be paid out when the property is registered with the PRTB and then registration with the PRTB could kick in for tax details and tax compliance.Given that landlords are legally required to register properties with the PRTB, it seems an odd situation where the Department is prepared to pay out rent supplement money — that is public money — in situations where the landlord may not be registered.  That does not seem to make any sense and the amendment tries to close that loophole and makes sure that all landlords in receipt of rent supplement would be registered with the PRTB, as they are required by law.The final amendment here is amendment No. 9.  There is a widespread problem where many landlords require tenants on rent supplement to make a top up payment.  This should be tackled.  Threshold has been campaigning on this for a long time.  Many tenants on rent supplement pay their share of the rent.  The State is paying the rent supplement, but a third payment is the top-up payment and this is required from many tenants.  This payment is completely illegal but we know that it is a widespread practice.  It is incumbent on the Minister to take action to stamp out this practice.  The way to do that is to have the rent supplement paid directly from the HSE to the landlord.  In that way, many different anomalies in the system can be dealt with.The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would have meetings with various housing groups.  We know what the housing groups want.  The issues have not changed in recent years.  They are public and all the political parties have been lobbied on them.  We know the changes they want and these three amendments encompass several of those changes.  On that basis, I ask the Minister to bite the bullet and reform the area of rent supplement.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I support these amendments.  It is frustrating that Deputy Shortall has had to put them in each year and discuss them again.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would not be happy if there was no consultation on these matters.  He intends to pick and chose what issues allow for consultation.  The groups looking for this and the people suffering for this should not be responsible for the fact that he is new in his position.  All of the different groups involved — Threshold, the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and so on — have sent every TD submissions on these issues prior to the past three budgets, so I do not think there is any Member of the House who is not on notice about the strong desire of these groups representing vulnerable people for change in this area.When the Minister's predecessor made many changes to rent supplement, she said it was the ideal time because there was much choice for tenants and they could shop around and move from one place to another.  At the same time, she always claimed she did not want to make changes because they might penalise the tenant.  This situation really penalises the tenant.  The choice for tenants is greatly reduced.  Where a tenant is coming up against another member of the public looking to rent a property and that other person can come up with the month's rent in advance and has no need for rent supplement, then automatically the rent supplement tenant is gone.  Such a tenant cannot compete.  The change in amendment No. 7 is important in this respect.The Department has great technology for some things, but I am always struck by sensible suggestions like amendment No. 8 that will save the State money.  We do not seem to have the technology to provide this information.  It is really hard to understand, when a PPSN has been used for many years in all transactions with the Revenue, with land transactions and so on, that it is not mandatory here.  I cannot understand what the Minister's predecessor meant when she said she did not want the tenant penalised.  This is not about penalising the tenant.  This is about ensuring the landlord is tax compliant and that we are getting as much revenue in for our money as taxpayers as we possibly can.  There is a loophole for landlords that we could easily shut down and  amendment No. 8 would do that.I originally had concerns on Committee Stage about amendment No. 9 because of the importance of people being able to budget for themselves and manage their own affairs.  I am amazed at the number of people in receipt of rent supplement who call to see me seeking local authority housing and when I ask them what their rent is, they tell me that officially it is, say, €650 per month but that they actually pay €800 per month.  This practice is widespread.  Rents may be slightly reduced in the current economic climate but top up payments on rent supplement are paid and that practice needs to end.  This legislation presents the best opportunity and is probably the best way to end it.  Landlords who charge such top up payments only declare the proportion of the rental payments that are legal and not the top up payments that are illegal.  We need to examine this practice.

They are reasonable.  I am all in favour of consultation but in the context of these three amendments consultation has taken place with the groups.  Groups, whether they be Threshold or Focus who deal with people on housing lists or those who represent private landlords, have put forward a case.  I know of quite a number of landlords who have made the case that to avoid fraud or the temptation to commit fraud among those in receipt of this payment, that the scheme and the State would be better served if the payment was made directly to landlords.  The landlords to whom I spoke have registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Rent payments made by such a mechanism would help them to be tax compliant.  All they would need do is check their bank account to track such payments in and out of their account.  It is a reasonable suggestion and it would be cost negative.  However, we need to do much more to ensure that all tenancies are registered.Deputy Shortall made a point regarding top up payments, which is one of the most disgraceful practices taking place.  Landlords are preying on people who are vulnerable and who simply want a roof over their heads.  People who like the house or apartment they are renting are being encouraged to apply for rent supplement and then they are being charged a top up payment on that supplement, and these are people who can ill afford to pay such a top up payment.  The payment they make on top of the rent supplement is calculated to ensure that they are not left in absolute poverty but landlords are demanding a further payment on top of that.  The way of ending this practice is to ensure that all tenancies are registered.  Once a tenancy is registered, such a top up payment would be illegal and a tenant could refuse to pay it without incurring the wrath of the landlord.I do not see that there is any problem with the Minister accepting these amendments.  Consultation in this respect could take place at a later date, whether it be this month or during the next two or three years, which would assist the Minister in perhaps adding to these provisions once they are enshrined in law to ensure that other aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship in the context of rent supplement could be addressed.  These three amendments do not address all of the problems in regard to rent supplement.  I encourage Deputy Shortall to press these amendments.

We must bear in mind that it is a temporary, short-term scheme; it is not a temporary measure in terms of the scheme being temporary but it is meant to be a short-term arrangement for the tenant.

Rent supplement, by its nature, should be a measure that would not extend beyond 18 months, and I am examining that issue.  Rent supplement is an assistance to tenants who rent private accommodation and the fundamental relationship is between the tenant and the landlord; the HSE is not tenant in such cases.I agree in principle with the point made about using PRSI numbers.  One of the first questions I asked when I came into this Department was why do we not request the PRSI numbers of all those concerned.  The number of PRSI numbers we get is small, although we carry out data matching.  We provide all the data to Revenue and match it with that held by Revenue.  I understand the level of tax compliance is very high, but that is not good enough.I will examine a mechanism to ensure that every landlord has to provide a PPS number.  Issues have been raised with me about the relationship between the tenant and the landlord and with the HSE being at one remove but I do not accept that because PPS numbers are required in other circumstances such as in the case of applications for grants and so on where the relationship is at one remove.  I will pursue that issue with vigour.An issue was raised by Deputy Shortall concerning the rent supplement scheme.  Payment of rent supplement in advance can be made at the discretion of the community welfare officers in certain circumstances and based on the individual needs of the case.  The discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and it specifically protects against homelessness.  In 2010 there were 119 instances countrywide of the payment of rent being made in advance at a cost of some €66,800.  A discretionary payment can also be made to cover rent deposit if needed.  There were more than 12,000 such payments in 2009 at a cost of €6.5 million.  In a case where such payment in advance is necessary, it can be made.In principle it is good that people have to register with the PRTB.  It is a legal obligation.  The PRTB should be vigorous in pursuing that.  Not all tenancies are required to be registered with the PRTB — there are some exceptions.  It is not a requirement of the rent supplement scheme that landlords must be registered with the PRTB before rent supplement is paid to a tenant.  The Department has received legal advice to the effect that rent supplement is the property of the tenant, not the landlord.  The Department has received further legal advice that the contract between the landlord and the tenant is not affected by non-registration of a tenancy.  Termination of payment of rent supplement to a tenant would have the likely effect of rendering a tenant unable to meet his or her legal obligations under the tenancy.  Therefore, non-registration by the landlord should not in itself extinguish the tenant's entitlement to rent supplement.I do not wish to penalise tenants for the failure of individual landlords to meet their statutory obligations.  However, there is a need to ensure that all landlords, including those renting out property to people in receipt of rent supplement, comply with the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act.  The PRTB has been given powers to deal with unregistered landlords and the Department will continue to work closely with the board to assist it in exercising these powers.

The Department will continue to co-operate with any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act.  It seems that the best way to address this issue is to ensure that the PRTB is in a position to enforce the law vigorously and that it is aware of landlords who have tenancies.  The law should be fully enforced.  Landlords have an obligation to register with the PRTB and it is unacceptable that landlords would have tenancies and not be registered.  I will examine this issue.  I had a meeting this morning with representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I will meet representatives of Simon, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent De Paul together — this grouping was part of Focus Ireland — and I will also meet Threshold on its own at its request.  I will actively pursue this matter in the coming month.  I intend to address all the issues that exist.

I cannot think of anything more important for the Department of Social Protection to do than to carry out reviews on the implications of budgetary decisions for social welfare recipients.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue.  There was a commitment some years ago that every decision made by Government would be subject to a poverty impact assessment.  There is a pressing requirement for the implementation of the carbon tax to be poverty proofed.

We hear many complaints from gardaí and others involved in the judicial system, as well as from those who have had to go through the system, about the process in respect of civil fines and non-payment of debt, with so many people ending up in prison.  I take on board the point made by the Minister last week about social welfare payments being seen as a minimum standard below which a person cannot survive.  However, there should be no sector of society that is virtually immune from the law in the sense that individuals will do one night in prison after which the fine still stands but the person to whom it is owed never receives it.

Overpayments by the Department are recovered either through repayments by the customer or from the deceased customer's estate or else by deduction from a subsequent social welfare payment.  The existing system is fair enough.  The Fines Bill 2009 deals with the issue of fines, which is a totally separate matter.  In 2008 net overpayments amounted to €54.5 million while the total amount recovered was €26.9 million, an increase of 12% on 2007.  I do not accept the amendment, nor am I convinced there is a honey pot of cash out there, as the amendment may suggest.

Gardaí are expending great time and effort in pursuing people for not paying fines.  The Minister said last week that a person in receipt only of social welfare has just enough to live on, but the reality is that such people are being pursued in any case and are being imprisoned.  If they are found to have received social welfare payments fraudulently they will have to repay €25 or €30 per week, so there is no reason they cannot repay a fine.  It is about the principle of seeking to minimise costs and secure best value for money for the State.  This issue cannot be isolated from Government.

Deduction from current entitlements will continue and will be extended as far as possible.  However, due to the financial circumstances of many of our customers, the written consent of the claimant is required in cases where deductions from current entitlements would bring his or her payment below the appropriate rate of supplementary allowance.  In other words, a person in receipt of the basic level of support must give his or her agreement to go below that.  Moreover, Deputies from all sides of the House have complained to me that repayments being demanded by the Department are too onerous and that we should go easier on people in these circumstances.The Fines Bill 2009 provides, for the first time, for instalment payments.  We are all aware of cases in the past where people of very limited means were subject to large fines which they were unable to pay in one lump sum.  That problem is dealt with in the Fines Bill.  Unless a person refuses to co-operate with the system, there is no reason he or she should be imprisoned for not paying a fine.

Section 15(1) of the Fines Bill 2009 states:If, upon the application of a person on whom a court has imposed a fine, the court is satisfied that to require the person to pay the fine in full by the due date for payment would cause undue financial hardship to the person or his or her dependants, the court may direct that the fine be paid by instalments.Subsection (2) states:Where a court gives a direction under subsection (1)—(a) the amounts of the instalments and the intervals at which they are to be paid shall, without prejudice to paragraph (b), be specified in the direction, and(b) the person to whom the direction applies shall, subject to 5 subsection (3), pay the final instalment of the fine concerned not later than one year, or such shorter period as the court may specify, after the due date for payment.This allows us to avoid the situation that arose in the past where persons of limited means who could not pay a large fine in one lump sum were imprisoned.  Discretion is given to the courts in this regard.  Any person who ends up in prison for not paying a fine does not want to make payment; it is not the case that they cannot do so.  Under the old system, however, people sometimes ended up in prison because of an inability to pay a fine which constituted a substantial proportion of their limited income.  That was unacceptable.

In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"3.—The Minister shall, within 2 months of the enactment of this Act, report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, on the progress made in reducing the processing time for social welfare payments.".This amendment is to ensure attention is paid to the length of time taken to process welfare payments.  I am particularly concerned about delays in branch offices.  While there have been slight improvements, and I am sure the Minister will give the statistics for jobseeker's benefit instead of jobseeker's allowance, this is still a problem that has not been adequately tackled by the Minister or his Department and it needs more attention.  People are suffering as a result of the delays, particularly those who do not automatically get the supplementary welfare payment.  These people are falling further into debt as they wait extremely long periods for social welfare payments.

The Minister knows my feelings well on the issue of the self-employed and those in receipt of farm assist, where the delays are ridiculous, particularly for appeals.  We can give out figures but unfortunately we can also give out figures for the large numbers who are committing suicide.  We must be conscious of this and ensure people get what they need when they need it.

In page 9, line 18, after "regulations" to insert "which shall be approved by Dáil Éireann".I raised this issue on Committee Stage.  It is important the power is given to Dáil Éireann to approve decisions the Minister makes in this area.  We were told this provision was inserted because of, for example, swine flu but there is no concrete reason that the Minister needs this power.  Before he makes regulations there should be a debate in the Dáil.  I am aware he says they will be laid before the House but many things are laid before the House.  It is difficult to get a debate on them; it is in the gift of the Government.  That is why I wish to ensure the Dáil would have the opportunity to debate such decisions.

In page 9, to delete lines 30 to 47 and in page 10, to delete lines 1 to 13.The second amendment we submitted addressed why I want to delete this element.  I presumed the Ceann Comhairle's office would have found a mechanism to obstruct me in my attempts to ensure the particular sections would not come into effect unless key aspects were in place.  My second amendment outlined what needed to be done but a letter from the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.A more careful reading shows that all that was being sought was an audit of key aspects, many of which the Minister would support.  He admitted on Committee Stage that particular provisions he is introducing in this Bill will not be commenced until he is satisfied that certain key activation measures were in place.  Those activation measures are not in place and some of them are included in my amendments, such as the need for additional community employment places; free ECDL Advanced places; more places on "One More Language" schemes; third level conversion courses so graduates can convert their skills to potential growth sectors; a review of the usefulness of FÁS training courses resulting in the elimination of those found to be of little value, as suggested by Forfás; and a jobs fund to create 20,000 new jobs.  The amendment did not state that all of these had to be implemented but that an audit would take place and people could decide in the Dáil if that had happened or not.The Minister's key proposals in this section relate to supplementary welfare allowance, jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, and all of them are penal if these provisions are not in place, if the training courses are not in place, if adequate, appropriate and relevant jobs are not in place, if educational courses are not available and the space for those courses is not available.The Minister wants us to pass legislation that will allow social welfare inspectors to reduce payments to people on the basis that they refused "appropriate" jobs.  There is nothing about the nature of job offers or course offers and there is no definition in the Bill of what is "appropriate".  What the Minister might deem appropriate might not be appropriate for the recipient of these payments, nor must all aspects of someone's life or qualifications must be taken into account because this is a discretionary mechanism which decides what is appropriate.  That is what it means when there is no definition.  That is why I am calling for all of these sections to be deleted until such time as we in this House are sure that the activation measures are in place.  At that stage we can decide whether we should penalise those in receipt of these payments.  As the Minister stated, some people will defraud the system while others who will never work again might need a more appropriate payment.  However, there is nothing in the Bill to deal with these aspects which the Minister spoke about.  Some people will never be suitable for employment or training courses.  This is not addressed but the Minister makes great store of it.  We must take the Minister on faith that the activation measures will come in the future.  He has not shown us or proven to us where the money will come from for all of these.I will not go on for too long because I know other Deputies want to speak on these major changes in the social welfare code.  It is an absolute disgrace that 20 minutes remain for us to deal with this on Report Stage.  The figures for those seeking jobseekers allowance and jobseekers benefit are worse than ever, particularly the number of young people doing so.  The figures do not take into account the 60,000 people, many of them young, who have left our shores to seek opportunities abroad.  What is also not taken into account is the fact that we are rushing through legislation about which the Minister stated there is no urgency because he cannot act on any of the provisions because he does not have the funding or plans in place to deal with the activation measures.  He still does not know how the FÁS parts of the Bill, which he introduced on Committee Stage, will work.  He introduced changes to FÁS just because of a change in the Department.  I call for the deletion of all of these sections.

I am concerned about the amendments to jobseekers allowance and jobseekers benefit on the basis that adequate places are not available.  However, people have to be offered a course before they lose payment and that is different to what the Minister proposes with regard to one-parent families.  With 17 minutes remaining we will not get to discuss one-parent families.  I have huge difficulties with what the Minister is doing with regard to one-parent families because they will lose their payment regardless of what places are available.  I know they will be allowed receive jobseekers allowance but the one-parent family payment will be taken from them——

Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the Forfás report, as I did on Committee Stage, on the quality of some of the FÁS courses.  The report clearly states that the quality of some of what is on offer is very questionable.  We are forcing this Bill through —  and we have a few minutes to go — when the consequences for individuals will be quite extreme.  Jobseekers will have an opportunity to refuse a course with good cause — and I would love to know what that good cause will be — but one-parent families will not have that option.  I have a real difficulty with this.When I read Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment I thought the Minister had listened to us on Committee Stage until I turned the page and discovered it was from him and not from the Minister.  I know what the Minister's plan is in terms of what he is cutting but I have no idea how he plans to provide these places.  As I stated previously, there is a huge lack of joined up thinking.  Much responsibility for ensuring we will have these education and training places rests with a different Minister, namely, Deputy Coughlan.  We have heard nothing from her on how she intends to change the further education sector, what she intends to do with the third level sector or how we will ensure there is an adequate number of places for all of the groups whose payments will be changed or cut.  There is no sign that anything will be done differently.Different people will be in charge and Committee Stage amendments were made with regard to FÁS.  The Minister will be in charge of it now and I have some idea of what he will do with it.  However, I have no idea what will be different from the perspective of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I would have liked to have seen that plan before taking the huge decisions to be made on this Bill.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I am concerned about this section, which is on people losing jobseekers payments if they go on a course of study.  How does this tally with the announcement made last July by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, when he announced 1,500 free college places for jobseekers?  When one reads the details one sees they are part-time flexible courses and there are certain requirements with regard to the length of unemployment.  It is also stated that participants will be entitled to retain their social welfare payments while on a course.  How does the section tally with this commitment?The thinking that somebody on jobseekers payment is not allowed to do a course indicates a view that there are many malingerers for whom there are plenty of jobs if only they would get up and get out.  The thinking that somebody on jobseekers payment cannot pursue a course of study is very much outdated.  Many people on jobseekers payments would give anything to get a job, a decent training place or to get onto a course.  Why is the Minister stating that they will have to give up their payments?

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	581	That is exactly what is being said in this section in respect of jobseekers benefit and certain courses.  It does not make any sense.  That type of outdated thinking should have no place in the current jobs scene.  There are umpteen people in the country who would give anything to get onto a course or to have an opportunity to improve their skills and prospects of getting a job.  The Minister or his predecessor should have moved on this at a time when there was full employment.  Now, everybody who is unemployed and every lone parent who loses his or her payment once the youngest child reaches the age of 14 and is forced to go on jobseekers payment is competing with 440,000 other people who are also looking for jobs.The Minister needs to get rid of this mindset that one cannot do something because people might give up their jobs to do a course.  That is where this is coming from.  What the Minister should be aiming to do is ensure that as far as possible anybody who is unemployed should be facilitated in doing something worthwhile, whether that is a form of work, a scheme or a training course.  People should be facilitated in doing this while keeping a payment.  What is the point of it?  Why is the Minister stating that payments will be lost if people go on certain courses?  It does not make any sense.I agree with the points made by other speakers and I must state that it is simply unacceptable for the Minister to expect us to deal with a major Bill such as this in one hour and 15 minutes.  The Dáil will not have an opportunity to address some of the key provisions of this legislation whereby people on jobseekers payments could have those payments reduced or cut completely if they refuse an offer made by somebody who decides that offer is reasonable.  The system is wide open to abuse because of the lack of definition of a "reasonable offer".  In respect of people in receipt of one parent family payment it will be the case that once their youngest child reaches the age of 14 the payment will stop and they will instead receive jobseekers allowance.  In such circumstances there are not adequate safeguards in the Bill to ensure that people are not made unreasonable offers and expected to do something unreasonable.  For example, people may have a 14 year old child who needs to be minded after school.The Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  He is forcing people off the one parent family payment before he brings in any kind of supports for families in such circumstances or anything in the child care area.  When we teased this out on Report Stage the Minster said he had hopes that changes and improvements would come in the child care area but there is no money to do anything with that.  The Minister's colleagues in Government are slashing child care services at community level across the country.  It is nonsense to talk about ensuring that child care will be available.  Those aged 14, 15 and 16 need supervision after school.  They need to have some kind of care arrangements in place for the three months of their summer holidays.  It seems that it is now Government policy that 14 and 15 year olds somehow look after themselves.The Minister makes no provision for those who have a child who has challenging behaviour or a difficult child who may have, for example, something like ADHD and needs close care and supervision and a parent around to ensure he or she does not get into difficulties.  There are no safeguards in place in this Bill to ensure that real life personal family circumstances are taken into consideration.  The terminology used is entirely arbitrary.  People who are in difficult circumstances could be forced to take on training places or employment opportunities that would make their caring responsibilities to their families virtually impossible to carry out.I have serious concerns about many aspects of this Bill.  It has not been given adequate consideration.  The Minister should have been serious about activation at a time when we had full employment.  At this stage, with massive numbers seeking employment, it is the wrong time to do it and the Minister will impose huge burdens on people in caring situations.  The Minister is storing up many difficulties for the future by going about it in this manner.  It is ill thought out and I urge the Minister to hold back on the contentious elements of the Bill, namely, those sections where he will have to set a commencement date, and consult with those who have been working in the field with the unemployed and lone parents on what supports they need to facilitate them in moving from welfare into training and employment.  The work has been done by all the groups concerned.  The advice and expertise is there and the Minister needs to listen to them.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	582	I share many of the concerns expressed by Deputies Shortall and Enright.  The reality is that 452,000 people are now out of work.  We need a new approach and new thinking.  While the Minister can hope that there will be appropriate training places, there are not appropriate training places.  It is one thing to say it but they are not there and the Minister has not created them.  I cannot see what consultation has taken place, with one parent families in particular,  yet the Minister is jumping forward and introducing these changes in this draconian Bill which will change the social welfare system here.We have not debated it properly.  It has been railroaded through in a very forceful way by the Government, something to which I object very strongly.  The Minister is living in his own world.  The training places to which he referred and which promised would be in place are not, yet he proposes to impose these measures on some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  To that I say, "Shame on you, Minister".  I look forward to opposing this Bill.

People can take up part-time courses and keep social welfare benefits.  If one takes up a full-time course one can get the back to education allowance.  The Bill states the exact opposite to what Deputy Shortall tried to infer.  It contains a provision whereby if one refuses to go on an appropriate course or refuses work there are sanctions.  I believe, as does the Deputy, that the vast majority of people in receipt of unemployment payments would give anything to work.  I am also told by all the Deputies in the House that a small number of people who are not available for work and are not actively seeking work are drawing unemployment payments.We constantly hear of people who are working and drawing payments, which is putting other people who are paying their taxes and working legitimately out of business.  It is right that the State should ensure that it has the instruments in place so that when people are offered appropriate employment or training and refuse, for some mysterious reason, to be available for it, it can act.  It only applies where a course is offered.  The number of courses is not material in this case because one cannot offer something one does not have, therefore it could not apply unless an offer was made.  A training place would have to be available.  Whether I have 10,000 or 100,000 training places it is only possible to impose penalties under the Bill if an appropriate training place is available.Either we are serious about this issue or we are not.  I said on Second Stage that under this Bill the various activation schemes, which are in so much demand around the country, such as the rural social scheme, community employment schemes, job initiative schemes and community services programmes, are to be transferred.  I could fill those schemes many times over with people who are genuinely looking to get on them.  One way of creating extra places is to root out those who should not get the payments.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I thank Deputy James Reilly for tabling the motion.  Every second week, the health service seems to be the subject of a Private Members' motion, other type of motion or debate.  I am not certain how long we can continue on this track.  I am not certain people will stand for the type of rollover crises we experience in the health service virtually on a weekly basis.  Given that the people who work in the health service such as gynaecologists, doctors, paediatricians, nurses, lab technicians or radiologists are all incredibly well qualified and dedicated people, one would ask why these things are continuing to happen.  It is basically because there is no direct focus on management of the health service by the HSE.Tonight's motion on patient safety arises as a result of the misdiagnoses of potential miscarriages.  Most women understand that reproduction goes to the core of what we are.  We may have some philosophical idea about why we are here.  Some people may say it has a religious aspect to it.  However, at the core it is about reproduction, which is why it is such a sensitive area and why women feel so deeply personal about it.  I am sure, as I have done, all public representatives, male and female, have met many women who go to enormous lengths to have a child, including all sorts of fertility treatment.  Even at the point when her specialist tells her nothing more can be done, she persists and continues because at the core our need to reproduce is fundamental to what we are.We must consider the circumstances that bring us here tonight, which are that several women who were pregnant were told their babies were dead and that they would need to undergo a D and C to terminate the pregnancy.  Only their gut instinct — I am a great believer in gut instinct — told them to seek a second opinion.  Each of them then discovered she had a viable baby, who went on to become a healthy fully functioning human being.  Any woman who has had such a diagnosis and went on to have a D and C must now be questioning that entire procedure.  In 99% of the cases the diagnosis would have been correct.  However, nomatter what we do, we will never reassure those women that what happened was right in their case.I recently had cause to visit my GP to seek a referral to a different specialty.  I asked to go to a particular person.  My GP said "Why not Dr. Murphy?"  I said that I just did not have great faith in him.  He said that if I had lost faith in a doctor then I should change doctor.  My GP was very quick in telling me that because he is a good GP and he recognises the person in the round.  If the entire nation has lost faith in the health service, something is seriously wrong.  It is not that we do not have good doctors, nurses, clinicians and specialists in every area.  So why have the people lost faith in the health service?  We have lost faith because of the continual almost rollover crisis I mentioned earlier.  We need to carry out some research into what it would take to bring back confidence in the system.  One thing it would take would be to ensure the machinery these people use is working and that there are second checks on virtually every important decision.We also need to look at the elephant in the room, which is the two-tier health system.  We have a private health service that covers a narrow range of functions, but operates magnificently.  The only way for that private health service to operate well is by ensuring that the public health service does not operate as well.  Why on earth would someone opt for private health care if the public health service was as good?  People would not do that.  They would go to the service that operates well and gives the treatment they need, and they would have confidence in that treatment.  However, in the event that the public health service is not operating as it should and the perception is that the private health service operates better, people will naturally go to where the service is better.  Why are we not taking a serious look at the fact that we have had a two-tier health service that does not give the type of service that is required?  The amazing thing is that this service is provided to the least well off in our society.  Do we allow it to continue because it is regarded as acceptable to treat people who have lesser means in that fashion?  If that is the reason, we as politicians need to seriously consider what we are doing and need to carry out a fundamental review of how we deliver our healthservice.I believe three women, who were incorrectly told their pregnancies were not viable, have come forward.  I am sure other women have had the same misdiagnosis and sought a second opinion.  They have probably not come forward because they are thanking their lucky stars that they went with their gut instinct and decided to seek a second opinion.  How will we convince people that we have a health service in which they can have confidence?  That is the Minister's job.To convince people that they can have confidence in the health service it is incumbent on the HSE to ensure we do not have the types of crises we have now.  We have had the cases of Susie Long and Rebecca O'Malley.  We can all name them and it goes on and on.  No one is accountable.  Every report we get into such crises firstly must go to the person who ultimately was responsible so that he or she can whitewash out his or her name so that he or she is not in some way held liable for what happened.  When will we grow up and put a tag on such people identifying them as responsible and needing to be monitored in what they do from here on in?If we continue in this fashion the system will continue to rumble on and continue to have crises.  We will continue to have misdiagnoses whether they be in miscarriages, breast cancer or bowel cancer.  We need to be adult about this.  We have a health service that can function properly provided that people are made responsible for their actions.  That is the only way that we will instil confidence in the delivery of health care.  If the Minister does nothing else she should take a serious look at the two-tier health system that has been allowed to develop and the reasons the public health service is not as good as the private one.  If she does, she will be remembered as Noel Browne is remembered.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I will reiterate some of what Deputy Kathleen Lynch said.  For any of us women fortunate enough to have had healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies, it is a life-changing experience.  The other side of the coin is the traumatic experience for those who have had miscarriages.  It can be very distressing and sad for such people and mistakes should not have happened.Women build up very personal and intimate relationships with their doctors and obstetricians and rely on these professionals to guide and reassure them and to answer their questions.  Women experience significant physical and emotional changes when pregnant and they need to be reassured and have confidence in the medical professionals with whom they deal.  The day when women presented to a doctor — be it an obstetrician, gynaecologist or another medical professional — and listened without asking a question or saying anything is long gone.  We should thank God for that.  In most cases those professionals were men — this is not to show disrespect to them — but they thought they were God.  I recall the story of a lady who was worried because she felt she was having a miscarriage.  She presented to an obstetrician and explained her concerns, as she had already suffered a number of miscarriages.  The obstetrician said, "My good woman, if you were on a plane going somewhere would you go up to the pilot and ask him if he knew how to fly the plane?"  I wondered who he thought he was, and how dare he speak in that manner to any woman seeking reassurance.  Thank God that attitude has changed and women are now asking questions and seeking the reassurance to which they are entitled.I had my babies in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and the treatment, care and attention I received was second to none.  I know many people who had similar experiences.  However, I know some people who did not have such happy experiences.  That the hospital is now introducing a requirement for a second scan when a miscarriage is initially diagnosed is to be welcomed and perhaps it should always have been the practice.  A decision on drugs or surgery must be signed off on by a consultant obstetrician, another welcome decision.  I echo Deputy Kathleen Lynch's comments.  Women have a gut instinct for when something is wrong and if there is a doubt, they should seek a second opinion.Unfortunately, medicine is not an exact science; human errors occur and mistakes are made.  As the Minister said last night, many years ago misdiagnoses and mistakes were covered up and swept under the carpet.  People were afraid to speak out, which was not right.  We must ensure we have expert clinical examination in all hospitals to reduce the element of misdiagnosis.  It is not something unique to Ireland; it happens the world over but we must reduce the risks to patients.Since I came to the House there have been many debates on health matters.  Every time we have one, the finger is pointed at the Minister and questions are asked as to why she acted in such a way.  We should be clear that the Minister is not reading X-rays, doing ultrasounds, looking at scans or diagnosing conditions.  Where there are errors which are highlighted and brought to her attention, measures are put in place to correct them.  We must put in place protocols to ensure they do not happen again and patient safety must be at the heart of everything we do.We can be critical of the HSE — I have been known to be critical of it — but I welcome the setting up of the HIQA.  People agree that it is working well and independently setting standards, monitoring and enforcing them and ensuring they are implemented.  I also welcome the legislation on whistleblowing introduced a number of years ago.  For far too long people were afraid to do this and there is an onus on people working in the health profession in this regard.  If there is something wrong and a person sees an action being taken in an incorrect or unsafe manner that puts patients at risk, there is an onus on that person to report it.  There must be protection for such a whistleblower. I agree with Deputy Flynn's comments last night that an audit of machines should be carried out to ensure they are working properly.  After a number of years a car must go through the national car test and why should machines being used to diagnose conditions be any different?I will conclude by expressing my sympathy to those women affected by the misdiagnoses and who endured unnecessary trauma and upset.  The Minister is committed to patient safety and will continue to place it at the heart of her work.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the outset I express my sincere sympathies to all those affected by the recent revelations; not just those about whom we have heard but those who continue to suffer in silence.  There are some who will never find closure because there is no effective methodology to provide such people with the ultimate answer to the hanging question arising from what we have come to learn in recent times.All these incidents are serious and they must be treated as such.  They are extremely distressing for prospective parents and extended families.  Deputy Conlon spoke about the trauma of so many people who yearn for a family and are unable to conceive for various reasons.  We have heard about this in the debate on foreign adoptions and the distress, trauma and pain that such desire can inflict on so many people. Adding the complexities associated with miscarriage where there could have been a family for prospective parents, one can understand the distress and pressure that will exist forever in some cases.  There is no resolution in such a case.  I compliment the Minister and the Department on what I believe is an effective methodology to deal with this crisis.  The miscarriage misdiagnosis review team has been set up and we look forward to a report being published within the next six months.  As I stated at the outset, this will not provide the answers but I hope it will provide enough information and insight into what happened so that we can devise a system that ensures not just patient safety in future but, more importantly, patient confidence in the system.I was taken to some extent by what Deputy Kathleen Lynch said about confidence in our health system and equipment, as referred to by Deputy Conlon.  There should be overall confidence in the health system.  I am bemused by some people in the Opposition who speak about needing to build that confidence but who continue to come to this House on an ongoing basis and for political purposes seek to highlight a particular issue, not accepting that there is a standard across international best practice recognising that mistakes are made and are an inherent part of the health service.  I do not refer specifically to Deputy Lynch in this regard.I was taken by recent comments by  Professor Tom Keane, who has moved on from his role as head of the national cancer strategy.  He has developed a very successful model for cancer treatment and care in Canada but never had to go before a parliamentary committee there.  There was never a question in the Canadian Parliament on the work he did and never was there a continuous politicisation of cancer care.  This case is slightly different but if we are to build confidence in the mind of the public we must put away the political sword and build confidence, although recognising that mistakes will be made.  We seek through general political dialogue to deal with issues within our control rather than outside it.There is also an emerging trend where medical professionals want to work in areas that do not lend themselves to becoming involved in diagnosis because of the potential for mistakes and to be pilloried in society.  We have seen this with anaesthesiologists, those reading scans and involved in various other such areas.  While it might appear correct to be upset in this House about an issue we must be careful not to undermine confidence in the system or prevent professionals involving themselves in cases in the future.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I am pleased to support what has been said by the Minister and my parliamentary colleagues during the debate so far.  It goes without saying that we must first express sympathy with any woman affected by the misdiagnosis of miscarriage.  Most of us who saw the various reports on television in recent weeks were immediately affected by it.  I believe they struck a chord with every family in Ireland.I am pleased that the HSE has moved quickly on this issue and has been in contact, through its chief medical officer in the Department, with all clinical care units throughout the country to ensure the decision to use drugs or surgical intervention in such circumstances is in future approved by a consultant.  I welcome the establishment of the misdiagnosis review team, the make-up of which I will comment on later in my contribution.I believe the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority has provided assurance for the public in respect of the Health Service Executive.  While it has been in existence for only a short time it has made its mark.  HSE staff are at the front line in terms of service delivery.  While I initially queried the need for a group to check whether the HSE is doing its job properly I now believe that the Health Information and Quality Authority, given its independence, was a good idea.  The authority has the power to make recommendations and is often uncompromising in this regard.  People often query the reason we must implement all that it recommends.  However, the authority is acting in the best interests of patient care and has no other agenda.  Its independence is to be welcomed and encouraged even though on occasions this makes life difficult for individuals within the HSE.  I am happy that work on implementation of the recommendations of the commission on patient safety and quality assurance is ongoing.The terms of reference of the misdiagnosis review team were set out on 17 June, which was prompt.  In terms of the make up of this team, I want to refer in particular to a lady, Ms Caitriona Molloy of Patient Focus, who is the general public interest representative in the management of this incident.  While I do not know this woman's background, I am pleased one of the members of the misdiagnosis review team is a person whose sole responsibility is patient focus.  The review team has much to do in terms of its look-back over the past five years.  I am pleased it will investigate cases, seek to determine the causes and responses to the cases and make recommendations as required, which is important.When something goes wrong in a hospital the first policy of the Health Service Executive is to deny it happened and to not provide information or allow people access to their files for fear of litigation.  It should instead seek to be fully open and frank with patients because not doing so results in a much bigger problem and often leaves people believing there is a conspiracy to hide information from them.  Where an accident or misdiagnosis occurs it is important first that a lesson is learned and second that the person is dealt with in a humane manner.  What has been happening in the HSE up to now is that the corporate shutters have been pulled down to deny all liability.  That is my biggest gripe with the HSE.

I will concentrate in my final minute on a point I have made previously.  I have had to deal with many traumatic issues during my time as a public representative.  While I have not had to deal with large volumes of cases I have had to deal with some cases involving serious issues which upset families and, in particular, women.  These people were upset by the denial, lack of information, cover-up and failure of persons in the medical field to come forward to back up their original instincts.  I welcome that a member of the review team is a person with patient focus.  I look forward to its input.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I am glad the Fine Gael Party tabled this motion which provides me with an opportunity to speak on this issue.When news of this issue broke one immediately felt a rush of sympathy for the women to whom this had happened.  Like Deputy Kathleen Lynch I too believe there are many women throughout the country who are wondering if this happened to them or who feel quite sure it happened to them.  Any woman of my age will recall when such matters were part and parcel of everyday life.  One is immediately suffused with sympathy for women who endured this trauma or who remain perplexed wondering "if" or "Could it have been so?"  This would be particularly acute where a woman had not had other children or, perhaps, a child of a particular sex.  It is a sad story.  The women and, perhaps, men involved are I am sure wrought with sorrow at what happened to them.Deputy Conlon stated earlier that there were women who shouted "Stop, I think I am still pregnant; I know I am still pregnant" and who demanded somebody listen to them.  One woman attended a third specialist for a scan which showed her baby had not been miscarried.  I am sure she and her husband or partner were thrilled and delighted to learn the baby they had conceived had not been miscarried.  What that woman did took some guts.Deputy Conlon was correct when she said that there was a time when whatever one's gynaecologist said was considered gospel.  One just listened, bowed one's head and was glad to have such a noble person, always a man, to guide one through the labyrinth path to child birth.  One always believed one was a lucky soul to have such a wonderful man — I was lucky as I am sure were other women so there is no point putting down all men — taking care of one's gynaecological explorations.I am taken by the fact that maternity services in Ireland are, by international standards, of high quality.  Maternal prenatal mortality and infant mortality are low by comparison with other jurisdictions.  Women can be satisfied and confident, as they come to use this service and move through their gestation period that they are operating in an environment which is by international standards safe and sure.Questions were raised in the House this evening in regard to the role of the Health Service Executive.  I accept there are many great people in the HSE who provide a really good service.  I am sure that at a local or regional level we all know some of them.  However, the HSE is too large to manage.  When issues such as this arise people immediately blame the HSE, which is unfair in terms of the good service it provides.  Its name does not instil trust in people, perhaps because it is too vast as an organisation.  Although we all had trouble with the old health boards — people used to complain about specific boards — at least we used to be able to deal with local people at specific locations.I hope we will never again have incidents like those mentioned in the motion that has been tabled, which we have had an opportunity to discuss.  I do not think we will.  Women should never again have to feel they have been dreadfully sort-changed in some way.  I applaud those who came forward with good and bad stories.  The good stories were uplifting, especially when they were accompanied by delightful photographs of children between the ages of two and five, who are here by the grace of God.  I salute the character of those women who pursued their correct suspicions that they remained pregnant.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion.  All of us will agree that the cases which have emerged in the media — those of Melissa Redmond and other women who were incorrectly diagnosed as having miscarried — have led to a great deal of anger and fear and caused many questions to be asked.  My heart genuinely goes out to Melissa and the other people who have endured such traumatic experiences.  Like many other Deputies, I commend Melissa on following her own instincts and, most importantly, helping to publicise this matter.  The news of this case will have caused great upset to women who have recently suffered miscarriages.  I do not doubt that some women are now second-guessing the medical treatment they received and wondering if their miscarriages were also misdiagnosed.  In recent weeks, people in my family have questioned the advice they were given.  That is not a good position to be in.I understand the helpline that was established in the wake of these revelations has received over 350 calls.  Given that over 70,000 children are born in Ireland every year, it is clear that these cases do not represent the experiences of the vast majority of pregnant women in this country, thankfully.  As Deputy O'Rourke said earlier, we have high-quality maternity services by international standards.  Our rates of infant and maternal mortality are low by comparison with other countries.  Approximately 20% of confirmed pregnancies end in miscarriage in the first 12 to 14 weeks.  The 14,000 miscarriages that take place in Ireland each year are hugely distressing experiences for women.  Early pregnancy units are in place to provide care for women who experience pain or complications in early pregnancy.  I hope we will not be in this position again in a number of years' time.  Serious lessons need to be learnt from this case.  We are talking about the lives of children and the physical and mental well-being of mothers and their partners or husbands.  While this issue relates predominantly to mothers, obviously, prospective fathers have also had to deal with great upset over recent weeks.The Oireachtas needs to ensure that standards and procedures are in place to ensure this never happens again.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children have agreed that a series of measures will be put in place to that end.  The miscarriage diagnosis review team, which was alluded to earlier by Deputy Fleming, will look back at cases in which a diagnosis of miscarriage was made in error over the last five years.  It will also seek to determine the causes of such cases, examine the responses to them and make recommendations to Dr. Barry White, who is the national director of the HSE's quality and clinical care unit.  The team's report will be published to ensure full openness and transparency.  As Deputy Fleming said, it is important that there is a strong patient focus in this regard.  We need this process to be as open and transparent as possible to ensure people are satisfied that what happened in these terrible cases of misdiagnosis can never again happen on such a widespread basis.  I will not go through the steps that have been taken by various Governments to improve services over the years.  I am sure all Members of the Oireachtas are keen to extend their sympathies to the women and families who have been affected by this matter.  We need to make sure it does not happen again.  I do not see this as a politically divisive issue — it is about life, children, mothers and families.  I hope the review team's work ensures that as this House moves on, it will never again be in a position to have to discuss such a terrible situation.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  It is my tradition on these occasions to compliment the Deputy who moved the original motion.  In this case, it was moved by my former health board colleague, Deputy James Reilly.  As others have said, he has given us an opportunity to express our support for those families which have been affected by this news.  I listened carefully to the thoughtful address on this issue that was made by the Minister for Health and Children in the House last night.  I join the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, in sympathising with the various families.I listened carefully, as I always do, to the speech that was made by my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  As she expressed her views, which I do not contest, I was reminded that one of my sisters had several miscarriages before she had her four children.  It is good to draw on such experiences during a debate of this nature.  Members might be interested to know that my local newspaper in Tallaght, The Echo, published a heart-warming story two weeks ago about a young woman I know well, Olivia Blanch-Dunne, and her two year old daughter, Ciara.  The front page headline used by the newspaper was “They told me my baby had died” and the headline used inside the newspaper was “Birthday joy for ‘dead baby’ Ciara”.  It is an amazing story.  Anyone who is not affected by these issues is not in the real world.  I do not know the people who were involved in the first story that was broken in this case.  I know the young woman in my constituency whose case I have mentioned.As a Member of the Oireachtas, one is often affected by things that come to one's notice.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien said, it is important to support this situation.  We could have a long debate about the HSE, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke.  I have views about where the HSE has come from and where it has gone.  Like many Deputies, I come from a health board background as a former member of the old Eastern Health Board.  Before I became a Deputy, I was the founding chairman of the old South-Western Area Health Board.  I always took the view that the kind of model used in the case of Eastern Regional Health Authority should be strongly supported.  I am sure Deputy O'Rourke does not mind me repeating her assertion that such bodies were capable of dealing with issues of this nature, which represent a particular challenge for the HSE.  While I do not intend to kick the HSE this evening, it is important for the HSE authorities to understand the concerns of many communities in this regard.I am reminded of my previous comments about the operation of the HSE at Tallaght hospital.  I reiterate that it is important to restore public confidence in the health service.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows I could talk for a long time about issues that have arisen recently.  Public confidence needed to be restored after problems emerged with X-rays at Tallaght hospital, for example.  People were very upset when it was revealed that GP letters had somehow been lost.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, will not mind me saying that people are similarly concerned about the issue under discussion this evening.  People in every family in the country, regardless of whether they have had children recently, are bound to be upset about this matter.  There is a responsibility on the HSE to take whatever action is necessary to reassure every mother who, as other speakers have said, is probably wondering about the diagnosis she was given.  While I do not refer specifically to my sister in that regard, I suspect that she, like others, is asking "if only" and "what if".It is important that this debate is taking place.  I thank Fine Gael for giving us the opportunity to discuss the matter.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Minister knows she has our support in this regard.  Action is needed if we are to reassure the public once more.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I support the Fine Gael motion on patient safety and, with my colleagues, I call on the Government to establish a dedicated independent patient safety authority which would incorporate HIQA, reassure patients that they have a safe place to go with their complaints, act as an advocate for them and ensure that investigations take place when and where necessary.Our proposed patient safety authority should take on the functions currently under the remit of the Mental Health Commission.  Our purpose in proposing to bring the Mental Health Commission within the remit of the patient safety authority is two-fold.  First, many of the functions of the patient safety authority will be similar to those of the Mental Health Commission, which currently registers centres and inspects services for persons with a mental illness.  Second, this will further help to integrate services for people with mental illness and those receiving care from other parts of the health service.  In other words, it will reduce the isolation of the mental health services and will allow each specialist area of health and social care to support and learn from one another in pursuit of the patient safety agenda.I now refer to the difficulties and challenges for patient safety within the mental health services.  The sixth report on the mental health services for 2009 was published in the last week.  The inspector was extremely concerned about the number of people residing in old and unsuitable dilapidated buildings and the fact that vulnerable people reside in these conditions.  The report used the word "deplorable" in referring to this.  The report was scathing about admitting, for the first time, individuals in acute crisis to such surroundings.  The report recommended, as a first step in the closure of these types of buildings, a decrease in new acute admissions and that all such acute admissions should cease in St. Ita's, St. Brendan's and St. Senan's hospitals.  However, the Health Service Executive has not said where these individuals in acute crisis being admitted for the first time will go, or how many beds will be taken out of the system by the progressive closure of the three hospitals and others whose closure will be recommended.It is estimated that approximately 10% of psychiatric nursing staff left the mental health service in 2009.  The precipitous decline in numbers associated with delays in recruiting health and social care professionals adversely impacts on the delivery of high quality care and treatment.  When cuts are made it is the progressive community services that are culled, thus causing a reversion to the more custodial form of mental health services.  We were promoting the idea of developing community mental health services.  We are now reversing that development.   A Vision for Change strongly recommended fully multidisciplinary mental health services to facilitate patients being treated in the community rather than in mental health institutions.  This is now being reversed.  There are excessive admissions to approved centres and outpatient clinics are populated by many with minor mental illness.  These patients, who should be dealt with at a primary care level are now dealt with in hospital.We continue to place in inappropriate mental health institutions individuals with intellectual disability, without access to specialist intellectual disability mental health services.  The inspector expressed concern at the occupation of scarce child and adolescent mental health service beds by individuals with no diagnosis of mental disorder, often with social problems, who have nowhere else to go.  This is inappropriate and potentially damaging to these individuals, as well as depriving others of the needed beds.The practice of admitting children to adult approved centres continues.  Recent HSE child and mental health service audits show that a large percentage of these admissions are 16 and 17 years old, an age group with a traditional pattern of short-term crisis.I am concerned at the reported 25% increase in suicide in 2009.  I asked for a debate on this matter this morning under Standing Order 32, but the Ceann Comhairle ruled that it is not an issue of national importance.  A 25% increase in suicide is not of national importance.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	639	In January 2007, a new statutory complaints system was established by the HSE.  As part of the system, the HSE appointed trained complaints officers to deal with the complaints received.  However the system is not working and I commend Deputy Reilly on proposing this evening's motion.Lack of independence is undermining the system that is in place.  In the vast majority of cases, patients do not want compensation.  There is an impression that the only reason someone complains is to get money.  Most people simply want the truth.  They just want answers, and to be assured that if mistakes were made they will not be repeated in the future.This did not happen in the case of the maternity misdiagnosis scandal.  Even when Melissa Redmond went public regarding her misread scan of July 2009, the HSE said the wrong diagnosis of the miscarriage in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was an extremely rare case.  Since then, a dozen women have come forward with their stories of having been wrongly told by maternity hospitals that their babies had been miscarried, only to give birth later to healthy infants.  That put a shiver down the spine of every parent and every woman who had a miscarriage in the last number of years.On foot of that scandal, the HSE received almost 300 telephone calls from concerned women and their families.  Here again, health management closes its ranks and lets patients believe it is "all in their heads".  Patients would not have the ability to understand the complexities of the procedures involved.  People, in the main, are looking for answers and an acknowledgment that they are right.  Instead, they are always one explanation away from the truth and, as a result, their own resolve comes into question.How can our health service improve if there is no acknowledgment of mistakes?  Mistakes will happen.  People are only human but the failure to accept that medical professionals are human has serious consequences in some instances.  A different attitude to complaints within the health system, especially to minor ones, might help to identify serious system errors before they have fatal consequences.  Instead of that, someone who complains about the system is considered to be a freak.A group of parents have been claiming since the 1970s that their children were damaged by State-run vaccination programmes.  Eventually, before the last general election and after a long campaign, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, put a group in place to look at this matter.  This led to a report of the vaccine damage steering group.  The report has been on Deputy Mary Harney's desk for the last 15 months and she still has not decided if she will implement any of its recommendations.  I am talking about elderly parents of children who were profoundly damaged by State-run vaccination programmes.  Will the Minister for Health and Children come to the House and acknowledge that the State had some role in this matter?  The State was prepared to buy off some of those parents by giving them £10,000 to keep their mouths shut in the early 1980s.  Surely it is time the Government honoured those parents and their commitment to their children.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	640	Every time a case of misdiagnosis reaches the public domain or questions are raised in regard to the systemic failures in our health system it should be remembered that behind the headlines there are real headaches for the patients involved and their families.  That is the most important thing to remember tonight.  Very often medical errors become public knowledge only because of the courage of patients and their next of kin in speaking out.  I think of a number of cases in my constituency — of Karl Henry in Ennis who spoke out following the death of his wife, Ann Moriarty, the Kelly family in Kilrush who spoke following the death of Edel, and Rebecca O'Malley, a victim of diagnosis, who continues to give courage and hope to others in a similar situation.There is no doubt that confidence in the health system has been eroded by the mishandling of errors which, sadly, have cost lives and left people with lifelong scars.  The very least these families deserve is to get answers.  However, very often the experience of patient is that when they speak out or raise questions they are met with a wall of silence.  There must be a sea change in this culture of institutional protection and silence.Fear of litigation has often been blamed for the failure of the health care system to respond to such mistakes but that is no excuse.  According to an article I read recently in the Irish Medical News, the health committee of the UK House of Commons considered introducing a legal duty of candour which would make it legally necessary for the medical profession to admit mistakes to patients or next of kin.  There is no such legal structure in Ireland.  The Medical Council has recognised that a problem exists and has introduced a guide to professional conduct and ethics which states that doctors should acknowledge their mistakes to patients.  This does not go far enough.  The lack of facilities and the understaffing of our hospitals have compounded the problem.  The management and staff of Ennis General Hospital, for example, have been starved of resources for years.  I hope the Minister for Health and Children will now support the hospital’s new manager.  I congratulate Frank Keane on his appointment and hope he is given the necessary resources to put into place the facilities that are required in a general hospital.A case was highlighted recently in the maternity hospital in Limerick in regard to the recent scandals.  Since 1999 a majority of County Clare babies are born in County Limerick.  The infrastructure at the hospital in Limerick is entirely inadequate to cope with the current situation.  The hospital is designed to cater for 3,500 babies a year but last year 5,400 were born there.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has told us on a number of occasions that best international practice recommends that a maternity hospital should be located adjacent to an acute hospital.  The intention of the HSE is to relocate the Midwestern Regional Hospital at the acute hospital but there is no funding for this.When he succeeded in getting agreement on health care reforms in the United States President Barack Obama said that as soon as he signed the Bill the core principle guaranteeing everybody the same basic security in health care was enshrined.  Every patient in this country must have basic security when it comes to our health care system.  Putting into place a dedicated patient safety authority is the only way forward.  Otherwise patients and their families will continue to suffer.  As a woman said to me recently, "Our family was handed a death sentence the day my father died because he was misdiagnosed".I urge Deputies, of whom there are very few in the Chamber at present, to support the motion and show the same expression of concern for victims of misdiagnosis as they did in recent days in the stag hunting debate.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I compliment my colleague, Deputy Reilly, for bringing this motion before the Dáil.  It concerns one of the most awful situations to have happened in this country.  There have been very many serious incidents in the health service over the years but this is the worst, particularly for women.  When a woman is told she is expecting a baby it is a very joyous time for the husband and wife, or for that woman.  However, when she is told the following week that this will not happen it is dreadful.  I am sure there are women who listened to their doctor, took the diagnosis and dealt with the situation.  Today I am sure they regret not getting further advice or opinion.It is an outrageous situation.  The time has come for people to take responsibility for their actions.  There have been very many serious situations.  Nobody takes responsibility for them and in this case, again nobody is taking responsibility, whether from among the medical profession, in the Department of Heath and Children or the actual Minister.  Nobody takes responsibility but somebody must do so.  We have put people into positions of trust, whether as politicians, in the Department of Health and Children or in the medical profession and if something goes wrong ultimately somebody is to blame.  We now have health and safety legislation which makes it clear there must be ultimate responsibility in regard to whichever case is in question.This was terrible for women and for families.  I hope we never again see a situation such as that which happened to these women.  We were told the misdiagnosis may have been because of machinery error, or whatever.  We are putting resources in health where there are very professional people who are well trained and well paid to do the job.  If they do not take the responsibility that goes with the job then something must happen.I have a question and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, might respond to it when he concludes the debate.  Will anybody take responsibility for this?  Who will comfort the mothers who today do not know whether their child was dead or alive?  It is terrible that this has happened to women and it is a terrible indictment of our health service that it could and did happen, yet again without anybody taking responsibility.I hope when the Minister of State responds he will tell us that some action will be taken, that there will be an inquiry and that when it is finished somebody will pay a price.  I do not care who pays the price but somebody should pay it because the mothers who are at home tonight with their families still wonder about what they did and whether their child was alive.  Is that not a terrible situation to face for the rest of one's life?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I commend Deputy Reilly for bringing this motion before the House and I am glad to have the opportunity to support it.It is wrong that people have to go public in order to get a response from the HSE.  Were it not for the 12 women who came forward and the 300 others who went to the HSE to report their stories all of this would have been swept under the carpet.  The contribution made by a Fianna Fáil Deputy some moments ago was outrageous.  He said the situation was not unique to Ireland but happens all over the world.  That is typical of what a response from the HSE would say.  When the story broke the HSE stated that the wrong diagnosis of miscarriage given at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was extremely rare.  If 312 people have come forward already how many others are there who have had that devastating experience but are keeping it under wraps?   That is the tragedy.For this reason it is very important that we support the particular proposal made by Deputy Reilly, which calls on the Government to establish a dedicated, independent patient safety authority that will incorporate HIQA and give reassurance to patients who have suffered with this devastating news.  It is important that an internal investigation, through HIQA, is not deemed to be acceptable.  I hope the Government and the Minister accept that.There is one exception to the many centres which have misdiagnosed in the past.   Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe is that exception.  The hospital has a well established and long-standing tradition and reputation in providing maternity services to the highest standard in the country.  It is also one of the busiest hospitals.  In the past five years, on average it has recorded a 9% increase in births each year, from 21,080 in 2008, to 2,229 in 2009.  From all indications at present this trend of increase continues.Portiuncula Hospital's maternity unit is a centre of excellence, a title earned as a result of its good practice and excellent professional staff.  It has an ethos of care, friendliness, comfort and reliability.  These qualities are not always available in the other centres.I call on the Minister of State or the Minister for Health and Children to give an unequivocal assurance tonight that the maternity services will continue at Portiuncula into the future, and that the unpublished report commissioned by the HSE regarding the reconfiguration of maternity services will not be implemented as reported.  It was reported that a new maternity centre for the midlands at Tullamore will encroach on the catchment area of Portiuncula and that will provide an excuse for the reconfiguration to continue.  This includes the Minister of State's own maternity unit in Portlaoise, which probably will be brought to Dublin or some place like that.  I ask that this report, which is currently under wraps, be published and that its implementation not take place as reported.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I strongly support the motion before us this evening and congratulate Deputy Reilly on bringing it forward for debate.I listened to the Minister's contribution last evening when trying to justify her position.  I listened to her make yet another apology to this House.  The most disturbing part of the latest health scandal is that of equipment failure.  Machines that were supposed to be doing a job were not capable of doing the job.  In the case of Ms Melissa Redmond, the ultrasound machine used for the second diagnosis had been showing signs of sub-optimal functioning and was not producing pictures with adequate contrast, to be reliable in early pregnancy diagnosis, yet the machine was not replaced.  Six months after Melissa Redmond's false scan, the faulty machine was still in use.  This mistake was compounded as the wrong diagnosis was not confirmed by a trained ultrasonographer.The issue of miscarriage is a most difficult subject to address.  Nobody wants to give false hope to a woman who is really having a miscarriage.  Nobody wants to give false hope to a woman who is advised to undergo a D&C procedure or other procedures. It is clear from the 12 brave women, who have come out publicly about their experience of miscarriage misdiagnosis, that an accurate diagnosis of pregnancy, particularly in the early stages, takes longer in some women than others.  Uncertainty about dates has a huge impact on what the tests mean and what the ultrasound images are supposed to show.There can be no excuse for the failure of the HSE and the Government to invest in proper equipment in our hospitals.  There can be no excuse for the failure of the Minister to take direct action on the miscarriage scandal and to alleviate the genuine concerns of many families facing trauma of having their case reviewed.  What we got from the Minister last night was the usual public washing of her hands together with the self-congratulations of the counter Government motion.It is simply incredible that the Minister would not take on board the proposals put forward in this motion.  What argument could any reasonable person make against the need for an urgent audit by HIQA of maternity services in light of what has gone on in this country?  What argument can be made against checking the standard and safety of equipment?  What argument can be made against examining staff workloads, care protocols and training of personnel?  What argument can be made against the reasonable suggestion that a dedicated independent patient safety authority be established?The Minister cannot merely sweep this serious issue under the carpet.  Trust in the HSE and the Department of Health and Children has yet again been shattered by a misdiagnosis scandal.  Acceptance of this Fine Gael motion will go some way to ensuring that the mistakes of the past are not repeated again.  That is the least the Minister owes to the children who survived these misdiagnoses in spite of the shocking failures of the systems that are in place.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	644	This is a very important debate as it highlights the need to put patients, patient care and patient access to some form of redress, if that is what is needed, at the heart of our health services.  Patients are major stakeholders and that is what the HSE, the Department of Health and Children, health forums and legislative bodies such as this House should always bear in mind.  Unfortunately, the incidents that have triggered this debate are stories that have sent a chill through many women.Many women were told that the foetus they were carrying was no longer viable and that they needed a D&C.  We must thank Ms Melissa Redmond and Ms Martha O'Neill Brennan who have come forward with their story.  They were brave today and they were very brave at the time that they trusted their instincts that they were still pregnant and they questioned the opinion given to them from an early pregnancy scan.  Both women sought a second opinion and today they have healthy and happy children.  It is a good story but it is also an alarming story.  We need to put structures in place to give reassurances that this cannot happen again.In June 2009, Ms Redmond went to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and her story was made public recently.  The response from the HSE was that the situation was extremely rare, yet since then we have seen many women come forward with similar experiences.  To date, about 12 women have made their stories public and there have been reports of 300 phone calls from concerned women across the country.We now know that there was faulty equipment involved, such as the ultrasound machine at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Alarmingly, this machine was still being used almost six months after the misdiagnosis took place.  The internal review also recommended a dedicated ultrasonographer be recruited to this unit, yet, one year later, this position has not been filled.  The message from the HSE to the women and patients who depend on our health services is stark — the HSE will not serve them.  They have no confidence in the HSE and this story is further alienating the public and patients, who are major stakeholders in the health services.  They have lost confidence in those who are charged with their care.I acknowledge that national guidelines are now to be developed and a review to identify all cases of known misdiagnoses is under way.  However, would this have happened if the two women had not come forward and used the resources of the media to bring their story to the public?  That is why Fine Gael's motion calls for a dedicated independent safety authority.  Such an authority could assure patients that there is a safe place to make their complaint, to voice their concerns and to be supported in that process.HIQA is not a patient safety authority.  It sets standards and inspects facilities to ensure that those standards are met.  It publishes the findings of their inspections and it takes follow up action if there is a risk to safety.  However, it does not have the remit to be a complaints body and it does not have the capacity or the mechanisms to be a complaints body.  The creation of a patient safety authority has been recommended by Fine Gael for a long time.  It was part of our policy in a previous administration and I strongly support it tonight.Having a baby is a major part of a woman's life.  For many of them, it may be their first brush with the health services and they want their baby's health to be protected during their pregnancy.  They want to trust their health services.  I acknowledge that we have excellent maternity care.  The figures on mortality rates are proof of that.  Nonetheless, we have a growing population and the number of births is increasing year on year.  We will have 80,000 births this year, whereas last year it was 75,000.  It is estimated they are 7,000 births a year in Cork University Maternity Hospital, which was opened in 2007, but last year there were 9,000 births in that hospital.  That highlights that in the short time since that hospital was opened there is already a capacity issue in it.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I would like to express my sincere sympathy to all the women and their families who have been affected by these incidents.I wish I had the time to respond to some of the queries put to me that fall outside the realm of the specific subject of this motion.  I will respond briefly to a number of them.  I advise Deputy Burke that I am not in a position to give a commitment regarding the retention of services at Portiuncula Hospital.  I have not seen the report commissioned but when I have I might have an opportunity to speak to the Deputy next week.  I am not trying to evade the Deputy's question, but I am not in a position to answer it.I support Deputy Neville's call for a debate on the increase in the incidence of suicide and I will take up his request and see if I can be assistance in that regard.  I note the issues he has raised and I recognise his commitment to this issue over many years.Deputy Ring called for an independent inquiry into this matter.  The chairperson of the miscarriage misdiagnosis review team is an independent expert in obstetrics and gynaecology, Professor William Ledger, and that in itself lends to the review having a layer of independence.In the few minutes I have available, I will speak about the issue of patient safety.  The priority at present is to ensure that the concerns of women who may have been affected are addressed comprehensively.  I welcome this opportunity to state that the Government also recognises the concerns raised in the motion.It is important to point out that the HSE has been working with all 19 maternity facilities nationwide to ensure that women with concerns about their care or treatment have access to information, reassurance and that appropriate follow-up support is provided.  A commitment on that was given by the Minister yesterday evening.I welcome the involvement of HIQA.  I also welcome the instruction that issued to all public and private obstetrics facilities advising them to put in place immediate measures to ensure that the decision to use drugs or surgical intervention in women who have had a miscarriage diagnosed must be approved by a consultant obstetrician. This should provide clinical assurance to women in regard to any follow-up actions, where necessary, and ensure the safe management of early pregnancy loss across the country.With regard to the composition of the miscarriage misdiagnosis review team, it is chaired by an independent expert in obstetrics and gynaecology, Professor William Ledger, Vice President of the Royal College of Obstetrics in the UK, and he is joined by Professor Michael Turner, the national clinical lead of the HSE's obstetrics programme.The information gathered from the review, the subsequent report and recommendations can inform the standards national guidelines for obstetrics — which are currently being developed by Professor Turner — which will provide essential evidence-based good practice guidelines which can be implemented and audited to ultimately improve patient care in the future.  I am confident that these guidelines will go a long way to help prevent incidents such as those that have occurred and which are the subject of this debate.It is also important to point out that careful attention will be given by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to promoting learning from these incidents to improve patient experiences and outcomes.Improving the safety and quality of care for all patients has been to the forefront of health initiatives introduced by the Minister.  She has been criticised for not showing a lead in this particular area.  It is important to note her involvement in the establishment of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, and legislative proposals for standards-based licensing of public and private health care providers.It is important to acknowledge the fact that HIQA is a key driver of patient safety and quality care in the health system.  It continues to enhance its role through its work in setting standards that will drive the quality of care into the future.  The soon to be launched draft standards on quality and safety for all health care providers will be a fundamental building block for a safer health system delivering consistently higher quality care.HIQA is an organisation fundamentally centred on the patient and its work is key in advocating on behalf of patients.  All its work in standard setting and monitoring performance against standards is designed to improve the patient experience.  It involves patient representatives in all the work it does, both in developing the standards and in ensuring they are implemented.There are many challenges facing the health services, as has been acknowledged throughout the debate.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is facing up to these challenges with determination and resolve.  Ireland can be justifiably proud of its maternity services.  As was said yesterday, and it is worth repeating, maternal mortality, perinatal mortality and infant mortality are all low by comparison to other jurisdictions.  Women can be confident and satisfied as they come to use maternity services in this country.In response to points raised by Deputy Neville, I advise that the number of child and adolescent mental health beds have increased from 20, some four years ago, to 55.  The issue of misappropriate placements of individuals in psychiatric hospitals is an issue of great concern in terms of patient safety.  The Deputy is concerned about that issue but I wish to confirm that by the end of 2011 there will be no further such placements of people under the age of 18.  That is a move forward and it enhances patient safety.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to contribute to the debate.

I strongly believe an independent complaints procedure such as a dedicated independent patient safety authority should be established in which people would have confidence and belief in the results of its findings.  It would give people who are let down by the health system an opportunity to put their side of the case to people who are not the deliverers of the service.  That is an important aspect of this debate.Hardly a week passes that there is not a national media story concerning wrongs committed in general hospitals, maternity hospitals, child care services, cancer care, mental health facilities and the list goes on.  Most people I know do not trust the HSE to independently and impartially carry out investigations into these happenings.  There are people of the highest integrity and honour in the HSE at all levels, but society now demands that serious cases of bad practice and procedure should not be judged by the suppliers of the service.  I noted that most of the Fianna Fáil contributors to the debate tonight believe in that concept.  While their arguments were not in favour of Deputy Reilly's proposal, they were certainly not against the concept.I have noticed down through the years that where a family member dies suddenly in hospital and the family of the deceased genuinely believe something went wrong in the treatment of that family member, they cannot not get an answer to their inquiry concerning the death from the hospital and when they do, say, 18 months later it was backed up with legal jargon that they did not understand.  Having regard to what is covered by Deputy Reilly's proposal, I would like an independent authority established, to which ordinary people could go cap in hand and ask it to tell them exactly what happened to their relative in the hospital concerned before he or she died.  It is as simple as that.  Until we have such authority, people rightly or wrongly will say that something happened to their relative that was not right in that particular hospital.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I thank my colleague, Deputy Reilly, for bringing  forward this important motion.  He and many of my colleagues have dealt with most of the individual sections of the motion, so I propose to focus mainly on the issue of people's trust in the Health Service Executive having been shattered.The motion deals in the main with the lack of treatment or mistreatment of women in maternity services, especially at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I, as one Oireachtas Member in an all-party group representing the area served by that hospital, have had to deal with hundreds of cases regarding mistreatment or, more accurately, abuse.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, brought forward a scheme to provide some compensation for the group but, unfortunately, on a technicality, some people have fallen outside that benefit.  Although the Minister agreed this was unfair and undertook to address the matter, nothing has happened to date.  We in County Monaghan were told that our maternity unit must be closed because there were insufficient numbers being dealt with to maintain the proper expertise necessary to ensure a safe service.  When one compares the record of Monaghan hospital with the alternatives to which women are now resigned, there is no comparison.The Minister and the HSE gave us further assurance that no services would be removed from Monaghan hospital until as good or better were made available elsewhere, but this promise has been ignored.  Our trust in the HSE is shattered.  Only last Monday Deputy Reilly and others were advised that everything in the surgical section of Cavan hospital was perfect, that very few beds were needed for surgery in the hospital and that one of the surgical wards had been switched over to medical services.  People have lost faith in the surgery service and are going elsewhere, to Dublin, Northern Ireland or to the excellent former surgeons of the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group who are now working in private clinics in Galway.  It is accepted by the HSE that there are problems in Cavan and even more acutely in the orthopaedic section of the hospital in Drogheda, yet it has gone ahead and closed down the excellent acute services that were provided in the Louth hospital.  Clearly the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is more important to this Government than the safety of our sick, disabled and elderly.Another service the HSE has curtailed is day care provision for the elderly.  For instance, two days of day care services per week have been closed down at St. Mary's Hospital, Castleblayney, affecting 131 patients.  This unit was provided in difficult financial times by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, with two wards that had been closed for years being reopened as a special care unit for those with Alzheimer's disease.  The day care ward is now being restricted.  Clearly it is more important for the HSE to maintain its 700 or more grade eight administrators, in respect of whom Professor Drumm acknowledged he was unsure of some of their functions, than to maintain services for the disabled and elderly.  While there is much talk about the greater numbers of patients being assisted through the home help and home carer schemes, there is no acknowledgement of the fact that the hours are severely restricted, with some patients down to half an hour per day or one and a half hours per week.What is required is an independent body to oversee patient safety.  Patient Focus did a great job for the women of Drogheda and something similar is required on a nationwide basis.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Harney, made an apology in the Chamber yesterday.  It is not enough.  Her record in the health service can easily be challenged and she should consider her position.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I take this opportunity to sympathise again with the women, their spouses and their families affected by the misdiagnoses at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  The Minister referred last night to being serious about patient safety.  If she is serious, how can she stand over overcrowded accident and emergency units, a situation she promised four years ago to treat as a national emergency?  This year we saw 500 people lying on trolleys in a single day.  How can she stand over the 20,000 cancelled operations last year?  Behind those figures are real people in pain waiting for treatment.  Their families make arrangements to look after children and so on so that their loved one can undergo treatment only to have their appointment cancelled at the last moment.  How can she stand over an increase of 70% in delayed discharges?  People are lying in hospital beds who do not require treatment.  They will miss out on the opportunity to avail of rehabilitation which would have allowed them to go home eventually.  Instead they are destined to remain in long-term care.Louth County Hospital has been downgraded and Monaghan and Cavan hospitals closed, with all patients shoehorned into Drogheda, an area that is a natural commuter belt for Dublin and has seen the attendant huge population increase in recent years.  It is an insult to the people of Monaghan.  People in Monaghan who suffer a multiple trauma are taken by ambulance to Drogheda hospital and because they were not treated in Cavan hospital, they cannot avail of the remaining rehabilitation services at Monaghan hospital.  That is the final insult.The Minister spoke last night about whistleblower legislation, but the reality is that the provisions of that Bill are contradicted by the gagging clauses in the consultant contract.  People do not feel safe reporting their concerns because in doing so they will find themselves isolated and in difficulty with their employer.  The Minister stated last night that the scanner in question was not clapped out, but that is precisely what the report indicates when it refers to "evidence of fatigue".  The Minister said such machines should have a seven-year life span, but that depends on usage.  A machine that is used as much as this particular one was is bound to be fatigued.  The Minister assured us the review will tell us the full story.  It cannot do so because it can look only at notes and files; it cannot review the live ultrasound examination that took place.  A picture cannot identify a heartbeat; only a living image can do so.  Second, if that picture was taken from the wrong part of the womb and the foetal sac was in another part, all we will see is an empty womb.The Minister spoke about creating a system that will be safer for patients. Rather than minimising the impact of human error on patients, we have a system that seems to maximise it.  We are all aware that human error is unavoidable and inevitable, but a good system minimises its impact on the patient.  It is commonplace in industry to have maintenance contracts on machinery.  Where was the maintenance contract for machines which can potentially determine the termination of a live foetus and deprive people who have waited years for a family?  That is simply not acceptable.  Add to these deficiencies the pressure on doctors, sonographers and nurses in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and other hospitals throughout the State and one is faced with a disaster.  I spoke to one woman who told me that the sonographer's pager bleeped three times in the course of her ultrasound.  That is bound to lead to errors.The solution we are offered is the provision of a sonographer for four hours per day to a unit in the Ceann Comhairle's constituency where more than 4,000 babies are delivered per year.  By any international standard there should be two if not four full-time sonographers working in that unit.  The necessary balances and checks are not in place.  We are reacting rather than being proactive, which is what a patient safety authority would do.  Where a single incident is reported to such an authority, action could be taken.  Instead people have no choice but to revert to the courts or to forgo their privacy by approaching the media.  We may complain about the media but thank God it has at least exposed this and other problems.I congratulate Melissa and Michael Redmond on opening the flood gates on this issue.  Unsurprisingly, the initial response from the HSE was to claim it was a rare occurrence.  We now know it was not.  If we had a patient safety authority these issues would be acted upon as soon as the patient made a complaint or expressed a concern.  The Minister said last night that the Health Information and Quality Authority can play this role.  A representative of that body has expressly told me that it cannot be an advocate for patient safety.  I challenge the Minister to ask Tracey Cooper whether or not she told me in a conversation that the authority cannot fulfil that role.Before Members opposite vote down this motion, I ask them to consider the €60 million paid out last year in medical and legal fees, of which €20 million went to the legal profession.  I have nothing against the profession but that money should have gone towards compensation of patients.  People revert to the courts because they do not have a safe place to go.  Members opposite should remember the late Ann Moriarty from Clare.  They should recall the words of Rebecca O'Malley and the advocacy of Patient Focus, Dignity for Patients and other groups.  They should consider the safety of their own loved ones and people in their own communities.  Let us ensure there is a safe place to which everybody can take their complaints, worries and concerns.  Nobody should be forced to go to the judicial system or the media.  Let us afford all our citizens — women, men, children, those with mental health issues, those with disabilities, whether physical or intellectual — the comfort of a patient safety authority.  We can estimate the cost of a patient safety authority but we can never underestimate its value.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	654	The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the construction of a levy on banks.  I realise amendment No. 2 was ruled out of order.  This amendment provides for the cost of regulation to be bourne by the banks and the regulated bodies.  In an answer to me recently the Minister for Finance set out the cost of regulation which was bourne by the taxpayer in 2009 for bank regulation as being some €34.5 million.  The view of the Labour Party is that the levy should be bourne by the banks.  I do not have to tell the Members here what €34 million would do in terms of various services which have found themselves short of money.One of the oddities of the last financial regulation Bill was that the cost of regulation of the financial sector was borne approximately 50% by the Exchequer and 50% by the various banks and financial institutions.  Given that all sources of Government income are under pressure and that the banks have cost ordinary taxpayers an extraordinary amount of money it seems odd that from now on the banks would not meet the full cost of regulation.As I understand it, in various other areas of regulation the people who are involved in the regulated activity bear the cost of regulation but for some reason when the Bill on financial regulation came before the Dáil a decision was made by the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, that the cost would be bourne 50% by the Exchequer and 50% by the banks.  This amendment would seek to provide that the levy and the cost of regulation from now on would be bourne in full by the regulated entities, that is, the banks and financial services providers.

It is very reasonable.  We tabled amendments Nos. 44 and 51 which will probably not be reached because of the guillotine, which are complimentary to and very much in keeping with the amendment tabled by Deputy Burton.  Amendment No. 44 states, at subsection (2): "In publishing its proposed levies, it shall publish an impact assessment of the proposed levies including relevant comparisons of cost effectiveness of its operations with comparator countries".  I understand Deputy Burton's amendment considers a situation whereby the industry would pay for regulation but it would be paid in such a way that, in effect, it would be break even.  There is no further cost to the taxpayer.  That is my interpretation.  It is a very fair situation.  The levies which are imposed on the industry are in excess of the cost to the industry, which ends up being charged to the end customer.  I commend Deputy Burton's amendment as a reasonable proposal.  I do not wish to tell the Ceann Comhairle his business but I am surprised amendments Nos. 44 and 51 from the Fine Gael Party were not grouped with amendment No. 3 because they also deal with the impact of the levies.We must ensure that the cost of the regulatory system is met by our financial industry.  Regulations have not been enforced at industry level and the taxpayer is pouring €22 billion down the drain of Anglo Irish Bank, as well as putting various sums in the other banks, and we still have not reached the end game.  For these reasons, we will be supporting the amendment.

We hardly need to point out the colossal costs which taxpayers must bear because of past regulatory failures.  We do not want to see a repeat of that situation in the future.One way of dealing with the past failure of our regulatory regime is to recognise that previous assessments tended to focus primarily on the costs rather than the benefits of regulation.  We want to highlight the benefits inasmuch as they restrict unscrupulous risk taking behaviour on the part of financial institutions, of which there has been considerable evidence over the past several years.  The cost of good regulation should be borne by the bodies to be regulated and the interests of ordinary people should not be put at risk.  We have suffered enough and it is critically important that the cost of regulation in the future is based on an assessment of the benefits to society and the economy, not just the financial institutions concerned.  Holistic assessments will be needed if we are to get a clear picture and the correct answer.  Amendment No. 3 makes eminent sense and I commend it to the House.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	657	It is obvious that the cost of regulations should be borne by the authority which imposes them.  If this Bill is passed without amendment, credit unions will be subject to extreme powers in terms of regulating lending practices, the reporting of loans, provisional reserves of capital against loans and specified percentages of liquid assets.  It would not be right to pass this Bill without the necessary amendments.Credit unions have done an outstanding service to their communities and to small time savers and borrowers.  People who have an aversion to using banks have always used credit unions.  All the people in working class areas use the facilities offered by credit unions.  We must be careful, therefore, that we do not damage the ethos of credit unions or burden them with additional costs.  I am fully supportive of this and other amendments which tighten the Bill and swing the balance away from the banks and the Central Bank and in favour of credit unions.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	658	Deputy Burton's amendment seeks to ensure that the financial services industry meets 100% of the costs associated with regulation.  Other Deputies have made related points which do not, however, appear to be apprehended by amendment No. 3.At present, the costs associated with regulation are shared on a 50-50 basis between the industry and the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland, except in the case of covered institutions which pay the full cost of the regulatory regime applying to them.  Specific arrangements apply to credit unions in respect of levies.The Government has signalled its intention to move to a model in which the industry meets the entirety of the costs associated with regulation.  The Minister for Finance had a long discussion on this matter with the Deputies opposite on Committee Stage and he has asked his officials to undertake a process of consultation with the Central Bank and the industry with a view to moving towards full recovery of costs.The existing provisions of section 33J of the Central Bank Act provide the bank with the power to impose levies and make regulations which, inter alia, determine the amount of such levies.  The Minister has a statutory role in approving these regulations.  It is unnecessary, therefore, to explicitly provide in legislation that the financial services industry shall meet the full cost of the regulatory regime to which it is subject.  Arrangements are being made to achieve the Government’s objective of a 100% funding model.  In these circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I thank the Minister for his reply but, to paraphrase St. Augustine, Lord make me pay the levies but not just yet.  In 2009, the cost of regulating financial institutions was approximately €69 million.  Under the current regulations, this cost is split between the taxpayer and the institutions.  The cost of regulation in 2009 was only a fraction of the cost that the State incurred in the financial crisis but while the Minister might argue that mechanisms were put in place to extract payments in return for the guarantee and other facilities, figures released on foot of a freedom of information request by The Irish Times and parliamentary questions I submitted some time ago revealed that the Department of Finance alone has spent €17 million for advice on the banking and financial crisis.  Since July 2008, we have also seen an extraordinary number of investigations and stress tests of the banks in the run-up to the guarantee and thereafter.  As we know, the most extraordinary case of costs incurred by the taxpayer is the €22 billion which has gone into Anglo Irish Bank so far.  At a committee meeting about ten days ago, the chairperson, chief executive and finance officer of the bank as much as told members that while perhaps €2.5 billion of the €22 billion may be utilised in a new, good bank, we can kiss the rest of it goodbye.  We are all used to taking it on the chin but €22 billion on the chin is a quite a blow.The revised Central Bank Reform Bill is meant to sort out matters.  Given what we know about the financial and banking crash, one of the principles we adopt should be that the financial institutions, that is, the regulated entities, should bear the cost of their regulation.  This cost should not be excessive and should be based on value for money.  The regulator should not incur or be encouraged to incur extravagant costs but the banks should bear the cost.Bearing in mind the way in which the Minister approached the various legislative proposals on banking, it is unlikely that any bank will pay tax for a long period.  Not only will they have the State financing their hoped for return to profit, but they will not have to pay any tax on such profits because such are the colossal losses they have incurred that a tax liability will not arise.  The Minister has made a small gesture in that banks may pay a minimal tax contribution to cover their blushes, as it were.Why should banks not pay the cost of regulation?  The Minister will argue that in the context of the banks, the €34 million cost taxpayers will directly bear for regulation is neither here nor there.  In my constituency, respite services for children with intellectual disabilities are being withdrawn.  The families affected by this measure protested outside the Oireachtas yesterday.  The amount of money involved, €4.4 million, is not terribly large.  A sum of €1 million, €2 million or €3 million would make a significant difference to the many schools which await permanent buildings.Why is the Fianna Fáil Party unerringly pro-banker?  Why do the banks not pay for the cost of regulation?  In the scheme of things, €34 million does not even amount to a hiccup for the banks.  While it is barely a dot on the horizon for them, it is a meaningful amount for ordinary taxpayers.  Such a sum may not have had much significance in the Celtic tiger era but as we learn to adjust to our new economic realities €34.5 million acquires a great deal of budgetary significance.  I ask the Minister of State to think again in this matter because I am not sure a budgetary saving of €34.5 million would be sniffed at in his constituency of County Clare.  If he realised that this sum could be easily available and were to agree to do so, we could share it between County Clare and Dublin West.I strongly recommend the Labour Party amendment.  There is value in sending out a signal to the financial institutions that it is not business as usual.  Citizens and taxpayers have been burdened with intergenerational debt to remove the burden from the shoulders of the financial institutions, specifically the covered institutions.  Setting this matter right by telling the banks they must pay the full cost of regulation from now on would be make a good start in sending out the necessary signal.

The banks need to be made fully aware that the game has changed.  We must not allow all costs to be passed on to end consumers and the cost of regulation should be borne by banks.Deputy McCormack referred to the regulatory burden on credit unions.  It is highly unlikely the House will discuss the issue of credit unions or the Minister's amendment No. 53, although it may be debated in greater detail in the Seanad.  The Fine Gael Party has tabled an amendment which provides that the measures provided for under amendment No. 53 would not come into effect until the order for commencement has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, it provides that the Minister, at the same time as making such an order, would publish a report on the impact of this part on credit unions in Ireland generally.Deputy Burton's amendment is a fair one.  A proper impact assessment of levies should be done to determine the end charge to the customers of the various institutions.  The impact on the credit union movement of changes in section 35 should also be assessed.  Credit unions do fantastic work in every parish, village and town.  In my constituency of Limerick city they provide invaluable help to people on the ground.The banking and credit union sectors must become robust, fair, transparent and accountable.  People must have confidence in these institutions.  We cannot allow a buccaneering attitude to prevail in the banking sector.  Regulation in the past amounted to little more than the Financial Regulator telephoning a bank to ask if everything was in order.  Unfortunately, various things happened in terms of the regulator, inter-director loan transactions——

I hold the Minister in great esteem.  However, on the one hand he states the Minister for Finance intends to set in train a process which will lead to 100% cost being applied to the regulated bodies — hopefully they will be regulated — while on the other he refuses to accept the amendment.  Let us enshrine the amendment in the Central Bank Reform Bill and let us have absolute clarity of intent on what the Minister indicated in his opening remarks in reply to our first contributions.  It is incredible to the public that after everything that has been exposed about the banks' conduct and disposition towards their customer base that we are seeing a continuation of the worst excesses of fees, punitive interest rates and an absolutely intolerable regime now applying where branch banking is no longer what it used to be.  We now have the advent — like a pub with no beer — of a bank with no cash transactions.  Customers can no longer contact by telephone their local bank and must go through a call centre — one of the 1-800 numbers that land them God knows where.  They will endeavour to deal with people in a cold and disjointed way, which is different from the traditional relationship between bank branch staff and their customer base.  The whole thing is going to the dogs and the defence for the unreasonable and at times irrational decisions that are taken regarding customers is blamed on the computerisation of the business of transactions, clearing houses and all the rest of it.After all the public have committed to rescuing these institutions from themselves, it is about time they were taken by the throat and shaken.  The people are absolutely infuriated.  One of the smallest and most reasonable steps that can be taken is that they bear the full cost of regulation into the future as the amendment requires.  Much more needs to be done and a wake-up call would need to be applied to the Minister and the Department over what is happening on the main street and high street regarding the attitude of banks to ordinary customers, people who through tax contributions are bailing out these institutions daily and will be doing so perhaps for the rest of their lives.  The Minister should stop the rot now and adopt this amendment and show clear intent regarding the purpose outlined.

I know representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions sought — and may have had — a meeting with the Minister for Finance to discuss their concerns about the Bill.  Did that meeting take place?  If it did it might have ironed out much of what we are discussing tonight.Does the Minister accept that the Registrar of Credit Unions is attempting to control credit unions in an unreasonable way that ultimately would mean  credit unions would be unable to assist their members as they have done in the past?  As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, banks are not lending money in any case and a bank with no cash is like a pub with no beer.  One simply cannot get blood out of a turnip.  The credit unions still have a vital role to play in our economy.  Lending to small businesses setting up would create employment in the regions served by the credit unions, which is now every region in the country.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	667	It is important to note the purpose of the Central Bank Reform Bill, which is part of a suite of three Bills, the second of which will be before the House in the autumn term with a further one later.  This is step one.  On Deputy Burton's amendment, it is important to note that the covered institutions already pay 100% in any event.  Deputy McCormack made an important point on credit unions, which may not be germane to this amendment.  In fairness to Deputy Burton, she has tabled a later amendment, which raises that issue very specifically and we will deal with it when we reach that amendment.  However, in answer to Deputy McCormack's question, the Minister to my knowledge has met representatives of the credit unions at least twice at this stage and has had discussions with them on various aspects.  I have had discussions with them, as I am sure others have had.  Some Members present had the discussion on Committee Stage over a very long period.Section 33J provides the Central Bank with powers to impose levies in much the same way as is provided for in Deputy Burton's amendment, except that were her amendment to be enshrined in legislation at this stage, it would remove all of the flexibilities which might be represented as having a negative impact in the way some Deputies, apparently sincerely, fear they would, but would also have the downside of removing the advantage of some of those flexibilities and the regulator's activities undertaken by the bank regarding the EU and so forth, which obviously need to be accounted for and done.  That is something that needs to be borne in mind.  There could be difficulties in the event that the Central Bank was dependent on streams of income that did not come into play and were provided for specifically in legislation and flexibilities were not available in that regard.  Other sources of funding that might currently or in the future be available would appear to be precluded in the event that this amendment were accepted.  There are many considerations.In the context of what the Minister for Finance is undertaking in this suite of legislation, his intention is to move towards a situation where all the institutions, including all the covered institutions and the others, get to the position of 100% payment, which is desirable for many reasons, including perhaps to send the correct signal which was rightly pointed out by a number of Deputies.  Dealing with the current reality, and bearing in mind that this is part of a suite of legislation, it is not desirable or advantageous for anybody at this point to accept this amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The Minister made reference on behalf of the Minister for Finance that the covered institutions are paying a levy.  It is important for the record to say that that levy is but a fraction of the increased cost of borrowing by Irish taxpayers and the bond spreads we have endured as a country following the blanket guarantee that the Fianna Fáil-led Government introduced.  It is inappropriate to suggest that somehow we are in the debt of the banks because they have paid a nominal amount towards the facilities and the guarantee they have received from the taxpayers and then to entirely ignore from the arithmetic the enormous additional interest cost.Paul Krugman pointed out recently that we have taken austerity on the chin until the pips squeak.  How have the international bond markets responded?  They are marking us up with some of the dearest bond spreads, much dearer, for instance, than Spain or many other countries.  Yesterday with troubles in the market again, our bond spreads have increased to enormous levels.  The Minister suggested that somehow the banks are doing us a favour and that Anglo Irish Bank, with its €22 billion, €20 billion of which is down the drain and we may still need to pump €5 billion to €7 billion over and above that amount into the bank, is somehow or other paying its way.  Like fantasy football that is fantasy economics.

It is an entirely different issue.  I have come here to debate the legislation point by point with regard to amendments I understand people have put down in good faith and the interpretation put forward by Deputy Burton is entirely at variance with the point I made.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"4.—On the cessation date, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 is amended by inserting—(a) in paragraph 1(2) of the First Schedule, “the Central Bank of Ireland,”, and(b) in Part I of the Third Schedule at the end thereof—(i) in column (2), "Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2010", and(ii) in column (3), "any provision" opposite the mention in column (2) of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.".I approached this amendment with some degree of hope that the Minister would take a fresh view on it.  The purpose of it is to ensure that the Freedom of Information Act will apply to the new legislation.  There is no doubt that in Irish society, bodies such as the Central Bank and NAMA and people like bankers, developers and friends of Fianna Fáil — however they are cast — wish to operate behind closed doors and veil of secrecy.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	673	The Labour Party is arguing that such people should think again, as this country has progressed most when we have cast aside censorship, provided for freedom of information and allowed people to know the true state of affairs.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that freedom of information processes are applied to the operations of the new institution.I have discussed with the Minister how there are areas of commercial sensitivity but equally there are broad areas of policy and practice within the new Central Bank Reform Bill that will reform the Central Bank and bring together the old Central Bank and the regulator.  These areas are legitimate subjects of freedom of information requests.  Ireland has progressed best since we opened up the country to freedom of information processes.Such processes are painful for many people, including politicians, but that does not mean we should not pursue the issue.  In countries and democracies where there is freedom of information generally — particularly in Scandinavian and Nordic countries — societies have done better.  Fianna Fáil should give some thought to providing for appropriate freedom of information processes applying to the reformed institution that will emanate from this Bill when enacted into law.

We believe the Central Bank commission should come under the freedom of information structure.  The point is transparency and having a system where people can gain access to information in a way that will make them confident in how the system operates.  I feel strongly about this and if an organisation is run properly by dealing with probity and fiduciary duties, there would be no worries about freedom of information.  Every Irish citizen and taxpayer who makes a contribution, including those paying income tax and social welfare recipients who pay VAT, is entitled to know what is happening in all institutions and what is happening in the Central Bank commission.On a related point it is unlikely we will reach the amendment being put through by the Government on the Central Bank, amendment No. 53.  The Minister made reference to various discussions taking place between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the collective credit union movement on this section in the draft legislation.  It relates to Part 7 of the Amendments of Credit Union Act 1997, sections 35(2) and section 35A.  Representatives of the credit union movement reached an understanding with the Minister that their views would be taken on board and an amendment would be forthcoming, particularly relating to section 35, that would effectively bring in the powers of the regulator.  It would be considered in that fashion.Did a meeting take place with representatives of the various bodies in the credit union movement before this amendment No. 53 was tabled for Report Stage?  The Minister should provide clarification on that as we have a credit union movement that has concerns about the level of regulation that will be provided and the general legislative powers to be provided to the regulator.  Did discussions take place with the credit union bodies on amendment No. 53 prior to it being put forward today?

They have a common intent and purpose, and I understand from Deputy Burton's contribution that when we talk about the Central Bank of Ireland today, it is understood that the Office of the Financial Regulator is part and parcel of that entity.

There is nothing to be protected in the work and decision making of the Central Bank of Ireland and its respective elements.  The application of freedom of information aids best practice, best decision making and an awareness of the potential of careful scrutiny, which aids and abets the already stated objective.  It is in the wider public interest not just on the basis of having a means or mechanism to catch people out but rather to have a much better understanding of the decision making process and why certain decisions are taken.  I strongly urge acceptance of the amendments as presented by the Deputies from the Labour and Fine Gael parties.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	680	As Members are aware, this issue was discussed on Committee Stage and, as requested, the Minister for Finance speaking note on the issue was sent to the clerk of the committee for circulation to Members.  As the Minister for Finance stated on Committee Stage, there are good reasons behind the exclusion of the Central Bank from the Freedom of Information Acts given the sensitivity of the information it holds, its independent role under European statutes and the very restrictive information constraints that go with this.  There is also the risk of an inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.However, as the Minister also indicated on Committee Stage, he is prepared to consider whether the level of information made available by the Central Bank could be improved within the legal and other constraints that apply.  The Minister for Finance will reflect further on this issue with a view to examining it again as part of a second Bill on financial regulatory reform to be published in the autumn.  In those circumstances I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 4 and 11 at this point.

I had nothing to do with these matters being taken together.  That was decided by the Ceann Comhairle's office.  There is a connection between both issues in that the flooding in Galway is along the Dunkellin River and in Templemore it is primarily on the Dunkellin Road out of Templemore.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the scheme and all the consequences of and damage caused by the flooding.  The situation in Templemore has become intolerable over the past number of years and the people of the town and surrounding areas are anxious to know what is happening.I will not go into the usual details in terms of the effects of the flooding on house insurance and so on.  It is important this project, which has been investigated by the Office of Public Works and has undergone public consultation and amendment is commenced.  I am seeking an assurance from the Minister of State that this scheme will go ahead and that funding in this regard will be made available.  I would also like if he could outline when he anticipates the scheme will commence, to give a categoric assurance that the necessary funding for it to commence and be completed is available and to provide me with a timeframe involved in this regard.

I will not be brief in return but will try to give full replies to each issue.I welcome the opportunity to discuss this evening the matters tabled by Deputies Coonan and Connaughton in regard to the flooding problems at Templemore, County Tipperary, and along the Dunkellin River, County Galway.The town of Templemore lies on the River Mall and has a long history of flooding, with a number of flood events having been reported over the past 150 years.  The most significant floods during the past 50 years occurred in December 1968 and, more recently, in November 2000 when approximately 40 properties were inundated.  Following requests to address the flooding problem in Templemore, the Office of Public Works, OPW, undertook a pre-feasibilitv study, which was completed in 2003.  The report concluded that a flood relief scheme was technically possible and economically viable.  Following discussions at the steering group with Templemore Town Council and North Tipperary County Council, it was agreed to undertake a full feasibility study and environmental impact statement.  The feasibility study led to the outline design of a proposed scheme being completed, which would provide the standard level flood protection against a flood event with a 1% annual probability of occurring, commonly known as the 100-year event.The proposed scheme works include the construction of new walls and embankments, remedial works to existing walls, construction of a bypass culvert and some channel-widening downstream of the town.  The proposals were placed on formal public exhibition, which I launched in January and February of 2009.  Since that time, OPW has been dealing with issues raised through observations received during the exhibition process while also undertaking complex site investigations.  A ground survey is complete and tendering for the main site investigation contract is to commence shortly.  These investigations are expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of the year.Subject to resolution of all remaining post-exhibition matters and the successful completion of the site investigations, the scheme will be forwarded by year end to the Minister for Finance for confirmation, as required under the arterial drainage Acts, allowing construction of the scheme to commence early in 2011.  I assure the Deputies that have I seen engineering works plans for the next two or three years, on which Templemore is listed.  As long as I remain in this office, I will ensure this work is carried out.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	692	If that is the case, I have no wish to see the Minister of State out of office.  People in the town are concerned that this is affecting planning at town centre level.  The planning authorities, in particular An Bord Pleanála, are asking what impact development in the centre of the town of Templemore will have on the flood plain.  We cannot allow development in the town centre to be stalled or delayed.  It is important the street scape and buildings are protected.  One particular development appears to have been held up because of this, which is worrying.  I welcome what the Minister of State said this evening.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I can assure the Minister of State that whomever from this side replaces him in office will ensure the work continues.

Progress is often delayed, as happened in Clonmel, when disagreement arises.  I have no sense that those sort of problems will arise in Templemore.Many parts of County Galway suffered severe damage and hardship during the extreme weather event of November 2009, including areas along the Dunkellin River and Aggard Stream where 20 houses flooded.  Many roads also became impassable and large areas of land were inundated.  Less severe flood events occurred in the area in 1995 and 2005.  Arising from these events, the OPW prepared proposals for works to relieve flooding caused by the Aggard Stream which flows into the Dunkellin River, together with minor works to the Dunkellin River.  These proposals did not proceed as it was not possible to secure the agreement of property owners in the area.Following the November 2009 flooding, the Office of Public Works commissioned Tobin Consulting Engineers to carry out a study to identify practical flood mitigation measures having regard to the unprecedented flooding at that time.  The report of the study has now been completed and identifies a preferred mitigation scheme. The extent of the works identified under the preferred scheme can be summarised as follows.  First, in respect of the Dunkellin River the proposals comprise channel widening and cleaning with localised deepening as identified along sections of the river from the sea outfall at Kilcolgan to east of Craughwell Village, excluding the Rahasane Turlough; replacement of the Killeely Beg Bridge; removal of the old N6 bridge at Craughwell and its replacement with a pedestrian foot bridge; installation of additional flood relief capacity at Dunkellin and Rinn Bridges; deepening of channel bed from downstream of the railway bridge to the N6 bridge at Craughwell and underpinning abutments at the railway bridge and N6 bridge; maintenance of the existing bypass channel and connection to the main channel at Craughwell.  The works that are proposed as regards the Aggard stream are channel maintenance and improvement works along the stream, the Monksfield river and the Cregaclare river; and the replacement of 14 field accommodation culverts with larger capacity culverts.This report was considered by the joint flood relief working group of the OPW and Galway County Council at its meeting on Monday, 28 June 2010.  The group has endorsed the findings and recommendations of the report, including the proposed works I have outlined.  The joint working group submitted its conclusions and recommendations today.  I hope to be in a position to respond to them shortly.  The report will be posted on the OPW website, www.opw.ie, early next week.  The joint working group envisages that if its recommendations are accepted, the planning process for the Dunkellin river scheme will be initiated without delay.  This will include, inter alia, carrying out an appropriate assessment in accordance with Article 6(3) of the habitats directive and an environmental impact assessment as required.  Subject to the satisfactory and timely completion of the planning process, the working group foresees that the main scheme may commence in the summer of 2011 with completion in 2012.In view of the nature of the works on the Aggard stream element of the scheme, and having regard to the fact that proposals for mitigation works for the Cregaclare scheme were put on public exhibition by the Office of Public Works in 2002, the joint working group considers that it might be feasible to commence these works in advance of the main scheme, if there are no significant local objections to proceeding in this way.  The joint working group proposes that the works will be carried out by the Office of Public Works on behalf of Galway County Council under the council's powers.  I assure residents of the Templemore and Dunkellin areas of my commitment and that of the Government to providing the necessary resources to implement the necessary flood relief proposals as soon as is practicable.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	705	Outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday, the parents and families of children with intellectual disabilities protested about cutbacks in the services provided to such people.  At the same time, certain Government Deputies had a crisis of conscience in this Chamber with regard to stag hunting.  We have not heard a dickie bird from them about the decision to give €22,000 million to a septic bank.  The most vulnerable people in society, many of whom cannot speak for themselves, will have to carry on their shoulders the debt resulting from that decision.  The crisis I am raising has resulted from the decision of the HSE to take €15 million more than was agreed from the intellectual disability budget.  People with intellectual disabilities, along with their families and carers, are terrified that services which are vital to people with disabilities will be withdrawn.I wish to refer to a letter I have received from the Ballinasloe Advocates group, which highlights the massive cuts that are proposed to vital services in the east Galway and south Roscommon area.  The group in question comprises parents who are trying to manage as best they can, sometimes in intolerable situations, as they care for people who pose various challenges and require care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  The letter states "we strove and begged during the "Celtic Tiger" years and received what could be described as minuscule improvements".  They were given the scraps from the table, year in year out, and now they are facing severe cuts in the services they need.  The HSE has left the Brothers of Charity in Roscommon and Ballinasloe with no option other than to introduce significant restrictions.  This significant impact of this measure on valuable day, respite and residential services will cause untold hardship for parents of people with intellectual disabilities.  It is likely that some services will have to close completely from January 2011.  These cuts will lead to the amalgamation of a number of homes, with consequent effects on residents.  I have already written to the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to express my health and safety concerns about one of these facility in County Roscommon.The unexpected moratorium cut that was proposed and introduced by the HSE has caused us enormous problems.  The Brothers of Charity are unable to fill vacancies that arise, even in front line positions, despite the Government's contention that the moratorium would not affect vital services.  This matter has been brought to the attention of local HSE staff and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  It is galling for service providers to be told by the HSE and the Government to cut their non-existent administration budget, at a time when the Department of Health and Children has increased its budget for office supplies by 67%, its budget for consultancy services by 600% and its entertainment budget from €100,000 to €200,000.  These appalling facts demonstrate the lack of priority of this Government, which is turning its back on the most vulnerable people in our community.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	706	I thank Deputy Naughten for sharing his time with me.  I also wish to highlight the plight of many elderly parents and siblings in the Ballinasloe and south Roscommon area who care for young adults and children with learning disabilities.  The Brothers of Charity have indicated that a cutback of €2.75 million will have to be imposed this year.  Such a restriction would make it impossible to deliver the services to which people are accustomed.  Over the years, these parents have begged and cajoled various Ministers to provide funding for the services needed by such people.  As Deputy Naughten said, care is required in many cases 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  What are elderly parents supposed to do if these services are closed?  Will the Government take responsibility for making provision for the most vulnerable people in our society, who need help now?  Many elderly parents are worried about what will happen to their children when they have moved on.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kitt, is familiar with the issues in the Ballinasloe area.  The same cutbacks have been suffered by each of this country's 60 voluntary organisations that assists children with learning disabilities.  How can any Minister or Government stand over such cuts?  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will clearly outline in his reply that emergency funding is to be provided to allow these parents to get some relief.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputies Naughten and Burke for raising this matter.  I appreciate that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kitt, is also interested in it.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to outline the position with regard to respite services for people with disabilities.  I wish to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy.  We will continue to pursue the long-term goals and objectives of the strategy in the coming years, in partnership with all the stakeholders.  Our commitment in the areas of disability and mental health is consistent.  Approximately €1.6 billion is spent by the health services on disability programmes, including residential, day care, respite, assessment and rehabilitation services, each year.  Despite the current economic climate, the HSE's national service plan for 2010 makes provision for additional funding of €19.5 million to meet the anticipated growth in demand for disability services in 2010. The Government appreciates the valuable contribution the voluntary sector makes to the provision of services, including respite care, to people with intellectual disabilities.  Respite services are being reviewed by the HSE on an ongoing basis, and the majority of Local Health Offices have reported that services are being maintained.  Over 4,500 people with intellectual disability avail of respite services nationwide and only a small number of service providers have taken the decision to cut these services.  In all areas, HSE disability managers are working closely with agencies to maintain respite service provision at 2009 levels as far as possible, thereby ensuring that those with the most urgent need for respite services are prioritised.

The HSE acknowledges the challenges service providers are experiencing and the particular challenges facing all health services in 2010. In this context, it is vital that all service providers including the voluntary sector, work creatively and co-operatively to ensure that the maximum level of services are maintained for service users within the funding resources available.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The HSE will work with the voluntary service providers to deal with issues that arise from funding allocations, to ensure the needs of service users are prioritised and addressed.Disability service providers were asked to submit their plans for the maintenance of service levels within available resources taking the following into consideration: items of expenditure which do not immediately and directly impact on frontline services; opportunities for rationalisation; the manner in which services are delivered; opportunities to reduce costs by sharing services and-or activities with other agencies; and the cost of back office administration, all other unnecessary costs, and rationalisation of general management structures.  The HSE will continue to work with the voluntary service providers to streamline costs and identify areas where efficiencies can be achieved without impacting on frontline services.There has been a continued expansion in the availability of respite support services.  These services have grown significantly in recent years with 307 new places and 61 enhanced places provided since 2005.  More than 4,500 people avail of respite services funded by the HSE.  This service has supported people to continue living with their families and in their communities.The Government is very much aware of the importance of respite service provision for the families of both children and adults with disabilities, and will seek to ensure that frontline services are protected as far as possible.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.The Laurel unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital is under threat of closure, which means the 19 patients currently being looked after there are to be moved to other units within the campus.  It is important to note that the same process was engaged in last year when it was proposed that the Beech unit would be closed.  Eventually, it was agreed to keep that unit open.  The danger now is that we will have this crisis on a recurring basis and unit after unit will be targeted, which is very unfair.The 19 people who are in this unit are high dependency and have various conditions, including Alzheimer's.  Some are blind and some have had strokes.  These people are in no state to be moved, nor should they.  They are dependent on knowing a familiar environment and familiar things around them.  They depend on knowing the nurses and carers who look after them on a regular basis.  For people with limited mobility and capacity to find their way around, they will be completely disorientated if they are moved to a new unit.Some of the patients have been in this unit for up to ten years.  They have learned to cope with their surroundings and familiar items of furniture.  This gives them some independence.  They are able to manage to get around a little on their own but in a new and unfamiliar environment they will be confused and upset.This is what their families are telling me on a constant basis. Their families have come to rely on the fact that the patients are familiar with their surroundings and are happy that the people being cared for are in a comfortable environment where they can move around with some confidence.  In many cases, the only voices these people have are through their families.  Many of them are not able to speak up for themselves.  The family members are extremely concerned at the consequences of the moving of the patients from one unit to another.  It is not like moving a mobile patient or someone who is recovering from surgery and will be going home in a short time.  These are people for whom the Laurel unit has, effectively, become their home over a number of years.This is short-term saving with long-term costs, particularly if the patients, when they are moved, are unhappy and confused and find themselves in what they perceive to be a foreign environment.  The patients' needs should be put before a very small financial saving.  It is time for the Government to address the real issues of our health system by putting the welfare of these patients before a small saving for the health service.  Deputy Naughten outlined a number of areas where savings could be made more effectively.I am urging the Minister to review the decision to close the unit and, in the interest of patient comfort and security, to ensure that adequate staff and carer service is provided.  The request is a modest one, in the scheme of things.  I understand that only two nurses and two carers are needed to maintain the unit in operation.  This is a small investment to ensure the comfort and peace of mind of a number of vulnerable people who, for the most part, have come to be dependent on the familiarity of their surroundings.  It will cause real hardship to the patients and their families if the patients are asked to go to a new and different and, to them, foreign environment.The Minister should look at this from the patients' point of view and not be influenced by the very small financial saving which will have long-term negative consequences for the patients.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I thank Deputy Upton for raising this issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children and it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to services for older people.Government policy with regard to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate and we continue to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country and to ensure quality and patient safety.The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as Cherry Orchard Hospital.  The Deputy will appreciate that all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic situation.  The executive has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be used to ensure that the maximum number of people benefit from the best service possible. This requires on-going review.Cherry Orchard Hospital provides services for older people, younger people with chronic illness or disability, and for people suffering with of AIDS-HIV infection, as well as Drug Detox beds, broken down as follows: long stay care of the elderly (170 beds); respite care of the elderly (22 beds); young chronic sick long stay (29 beds); young chronic sick respite (6 beds); AIDS/HIV Unit (17 beds) and; acute drug detox unit (17 Beds).The hospital therefore currently has 261 beds, and capacity for day care for eight elderly people.  In order to manage the hospital more efficiently within existing resources and to ensure that the same number of patients have access to the service they need in Cherry Orchard it was decided to consolidate one long stay unit on the campus.  Residents in the 23 bedded Laurel unit are being moved on a phased basis, to other vacancies within Cherry Orchard.The HSE has assured the Department of Health and Children that this will have no effect on existing respite and other services, which will remain unchanged.  It will allow the hospital to continue to provide its usual high standard of quality care to residents, and the process will be closely overseen by nurse management to ensure the minimum discomfort to residents.The HSE has advised that where patients are required to move within the campus the families concerned can be met on an individual basis by local management and nursing management.  Advocates for the patient/family can with the appropriate permission also attend these meetings.  The meetings with each family concerned allows for a patient focused approach to this situation and will be handled in a manner sensitive to the needs of the patient and their families.  In addition the confidentiality and dignity of the residents can be maintained at all times.  Patients and their families will be given time to consider the options available to them.The HSE also held a meeting to which all local public representatives were invited on 29 June 2010.  At the meeting local councillors outlined the concerns expressed by families of residents who had approached them.  This included staffing issues at the hospital.Employment control frameworks have been used for a number of years in the health sector to give effect to Government policies on the number employed in the health sector.  The 2009 framework gave effect to the Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  The Health Sector Employment Control Framework 2010-2012 has been agreed between the Departments of Health and Children and Finance and has issued to the HSE.  The framework provides for a target reduction in health numbers of 1,520 wholetime equivalents.Once this target is being met, the HSE is able to recruit staff in grades that are exempted from the moratorium.  This includes certain frontline grades to address needs in the community, including areas such as care of the elderly, mental health, people with disabilities and child protection.  In addition to these exempted grades, the 2010 framework allows the HSE, subject to meeting the target reduction of 1,520, to fill critical posts by way of exceptions to the moratorium.  Such exceptions may be made where the HSE has satisfied itself that there are compelling reasons for doing so in order to maintain essential frontline services.  This arrangement supersedes the requirement to obtain the approval of the Departments of Health and Children and of Finance for the filling of any vacancy arising in a post in a non-exempted grade.  It is, therefore, a matter for the HSE to determine the relative priority to be accorded to the filling of such vacancies without reference to either Department, provided it delivers the required overall reduction in numbers and the associated payroll savings, and meets the policy requirements in regard to service development posts and exempted grades outlined above.It is the view of the Department of Health and Children that exceptions should be kept to the absolute minimum in order to achieve the target growth in exempted grades and support the transformation agenda.  It is a matter for the HSE to deliver services, both nationally and locally, within its budget and overall health policy priorities.  Understandably, the executive regrets any inconvenience or concern caused to patients and their families in this particular instance, and will obviously try to minimise this as far as possible.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to explain why a child, who heretofore has travelled the six miles to her school on a school bus which passes her gate, as did both her older siblings, has been told to move to a new school over 15 miles away.  Her father attended the same school 35 years ago using this same bus service, which has passed their gate for 40 years.The child concerned is expected to up-root from her current school, St. John's Church of Ireland national school, travel 4.9 miles by car to Keenagh, County Longford, and then a further 12 miles to Tashinny national school, by school bus.  This is bureaucracy and red tape gone mad.  In case the import of the farcical letter this child's parents received from the school transport section of the Department has failed to resonate with the Minister of State, the child concerned is being asked to travel more than 15 miles each way to a new school she did not ask to attend.  Her parents made no request for a transfer.  Why should they do so?  St. John's has become a family institution with which they are extremely satisfied.This is farcical when one considers that the child is extremely happy in her current situation, in a school she likes, with her friends around her, taking a journey to school of six miles as opposed to 15, in a bus that picks her up at her gate in the morning and drops her back in the evening.  On top of this her mother will have to drive her to the bus, which will impact adversely on the mother's time and inconvenience her without anyone having asked her if this would be possible.  It is not possible as the mother works from home and needs to be available from 8.30 a.m.  To add to the farce, the child's younger brother is due to start school in September at St. John's in Longford.  No letter has been issued in regard to him or his situation.  This is akin to taking a hammer to crack a nut — the only problem being that nobody knows what kind of nut it is.Apart from wanting the Minister of State's commitment to reverse this extraordinary decision, I want to know why it was made in the first place.  As with all current, arbitrary heartless Government decisions one looks for the cost-cutting potential saving of the action.  In this case it is hard to find one.  A journey of 15 miles is more fuel intensive than one of six miles — no saving there.  The cost in terms of human displacement and upset is certainly present but that is of little regard to the Government.  One looks then to the next possible scenario, namely, school amalgamation.  In this case that would be impossible from a logistics point of view but given the letter under discussion one can see that anything is possible in the education sector.There is another area  I do not want to get into but must mention because of the recent targeting by Government of minority schools in terms of funding and staffing levels.  Does the fact that these are Church of Ireland schools have any bearing on the matter?  I sincerely hope it does not and pay the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, the compliment of assuming this is not the case.This family lives in the parish of Longford, not the Ardagh group of parishes, and St. John's is their parish school.  Although it is difficult to have to ask a child to take a bus six miles to school, travelling distances is a fact of rural life.  By any standards, however, asking this child and also perhaps her very young brother to travel 15 miles is excessive.  The child in question is about to enter fifth class and it is not in her best interest to ask her parents to move her to a new school.  It might be extremely detrimental to her current and future educational development as she is dyslexic, has only just found her feet in her current school and gained in confidence due to the supports she is being given.I am sure that, true to form, the Minister will have an explanation for me but whether it will remove the element of farce remains to be seen.  I fear, based on previous experience that it may greatly enhance it.  I ask the Minister to allow common sense to prevail.  It is very important that this child be facilitated in her home parish, as all her siblings were and that the same facility be afforded her brother who is due to start school in September.  I do not know what kind of mix-up or mess in the Department's school transport section has allowed such a situation to occur.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	715	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, Deputy Seán Haughey.  I thank Deputy Bannon for raising this matter.Before I address the issue of the transport for this particular child, I will give Members an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  School transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on the Department's behalf and covering over 82 million kilometres annually.  In the region of 125,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in over 3,800 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  This includes over 9,000 schoolchildren who travel on scheduled bus and rail services, including those of licensed private operators.Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme pupils are eligible for free transport if they reside 3.2 km or more from, and are attending, their nearest national school as determined by the Department.  Where a school is closed and amalgamated with another, children for whom the closed school would have been their nearest had it remained open, are eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation.  Pupils may avail of transport to a school other than the amalgamated school on a concessionary basis.  Such an arrangement would be subject to a number of conditions as follows: the payment of an annual charge which is currently €200; spare seats being available on the service; the agreement of the school of amalgamation being obtained; and no additional State costs being incurred by way of re-routing the service.In regard to the case outlined by the Deputy, Bus Éireann has been requested to submit a report on the matter.  On receipt of this report the Department will be in a position to investigate the matter more fully and issue a reply directly to the Deputy.  I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.

St. Patrick's Institution is a Closed Prison.The average cost of an available, staffed prison space during the calendar year 2009  will be published in the Irish Prison Service Annual Report for 2009 which is due to be published shortly. However, provisional figures indicate that the average cost of an available, staffed prison space in a Closed Prison during the calendar year 2009 was €79,308 compared to €90,837 in 2008, a decrease of €11,529 or 12.7%. The figure for 2007 was €82,662. The average cost of keeping an offender in St. Patrick's Institution specifically was €94,164 in 2009, €101,590 in 2008 and €91,031 in 2007.The figures stated have all been calculated using the revised methodology for measuring costs. The revised methodology used since 2008 is of greater benefit in the financial management of the Service than the one previously used as it facilitates the strategic measuring and comparing of costs across the prison estate.

"Advertisement" in this context is defined as including every form of advertising or promotion, including by way of computer monitor, telephone, photography or other like means of communication.However, I understand that difficulties arise in practice because the websites in question are hosted abroad. When I launched the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking in June 2009, I emphasised the Government's commitment to protect vulnerable people who may become victims of traffickers and to tackle the crime of human trafficking.  The Government has taken strong legislative, administrative and operational measures to combat and prevent  trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in February, 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive. This has led to the production of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking.In addition, An Garda Síochána has established a Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit.  I am confident that the Force is vigorously pursuing enforcement of the law in this area.  The Garda authorities have conducted a number of operations to combat brothel keeping, prostitution and human trafficking and will continue to do so in line with the intelligence available to them.  The law in relation to prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The provisions of the Guardianship of Children Act 1964 in relation to guardianship, custody of and access to children have been the subject of significant updating, both in 1987 and 1997. Under section 6 of the 1964 Act both the mother and father of children born within marriage are the joint guardians of their children.  In relation to children born outside marriage, the mother is the sole guardian. Under section 6A of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, a non-marital father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her father and mother: Section 11D of the 1964 Act (inserted by the Children Act 1997) obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.These legislative provisions, contained in the Guardianship of Children Acts 1964 to 1997, are comprehensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.In the High Court case concerning the abduction of children referred to by the Deputy (J. McB. v L.E. 2010 IEHC 123) it is of some significance that the Judge indicated that had the applicant made an application to our courts for guardianship or custody orders the outcome of the case could well have been radically different.As part of its Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014, the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper ‘ Legal Aspects of Family Relationships', in September 2009. In the consultation paper, the Commission makes provisional recommendations on the rights and duties of fathers in relation to guardianship, custody of and access to their children and on the rights and duties of extended family members including grandparents and step-parents. The Commission has invited submissions on these issues as part of its consultation process. In particular, the Commission has invited submissions as to whether it would be appropriate to introduce automatic guardianship / parental responsibility for all fathers in Ireland. The Commission's final report and recommendations, expected to be published later this year, will help to inform debate on the issues in advance of the formulation of any proposals for reform of the law in this area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The Probation Service of my Department is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.  In common with the rest of the Civil Service the Probation Service is subject to the Government's moratorium on recruitment and promotion and its staff also have access to the Incentivised Career Break Scheme and the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement. Where vacancies do arise, the Probation Service is required to further prioritise its workload.When the Probation Service was restructured five years ago, emphasis was placed on working with higher risk offenders and juvenile offenders and in developing the Community Service system as an effective alternative to custody.  These remain the priority areas for the Probation Service.As part of this re-focusing of its work the Deputy will be aware the Probation Service has benefited from the provision of an increased level of resources during the restructuring period. This has meant that despite the impact of the Moratorium and other associated measures such as the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) and the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (ICBS), the number of staff working in the Service is still greater than at the end of 2006 and only marginally less than at the end of 2007.  Excluding those vacancies arising from staff availing of ISER and ICBS, both of which Schemes were specifically designed to reduce Civil Service numbers, 28 whole-time equivalent vacancies have arisen since the introduction of the Moratorium. Of these, 21 are in the ranks of Probation Officer/Community Service Supervisor with the remainder from Administrative Support Staff.My Department and Probation Service management are keeping the situation under constant review to ensure that the resources at the disposal of the Service are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible.In addition to the core staffing provided to the Service my Department, through the Probation Service, provides funding — amounting to 31% of the total Probation budget for 2010 — to approximately 50 voluntary bodies to add value to the core work of the Service and to assist with the management of offenders in the community.With regard to diversion programmes, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that, at present, there are 116 Juvenile Liaison Officer posts approved within An Garda Síochána. One hundred and eleven of these posts are currently filled on a full-time basis.  Five of the posts are vacant and the selection process for the new JLOs is well underway.  I should point out that the Commissioner has approved the appointment of 7 additional JLOs each year for the past 3 years and a further seven  posts will be added in accordance with the targets set out in the Garda Youth and Children Strategy 2009 — 2011. This will bring the total of approved JLO posts to 123.With regard to the issue of anti-social behaviour, the Deputy will be aware that Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.Up to 30 April, 2010, 1,670 behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and 1,278 to children.  Thirteen good behaviour contracts have been issued to children.  In addition, three civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the Courts.At present the most common non-custodial sanction used by the Courts is the imposition of a fine and the new Fines Act will make a significant contribution to keeping people out of the prison system.I should also add that the most recently published Discussion Document of the White Paper on Crime series, ‘ Criminal Sanctions', will include an examination of the use of non-custodial sanctions generally.  Submissions on this Document were invited before the end of May and the opinions received will inform future plans.

These services operate where persons have been detained and in other circumstances, as required, and the Commissioner has reported that the current interpretation arrangements are working well.The Garda authorities have structured their contracts to ensure that persons carrying out interpretation work will be qualified to a high level.  The Commissioner is aware that as things currently stand there are no national standards for the provision of interpretation services and he has indicated that he would support the adoption of such standards.

In all such cases, I, as Minister, must decide whether a Deportation Order should be made or leave to remain in the State should be granted. This process is founded on the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).The number of cases finalised in the twelve month period from 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2010 was as follows:(i) a Deportation Order was made in985 cases,(ii) Leave to Remain was granted in660 cases and(iii) Voluntary Returns were facilitated in414 cases meaning that, in total, 2,059 cases were finalised in the period in question.At 31 May 2010, there were 11,700 cases on hands.The Deputy should appreciate that the processing of cases at the repatriation stage of the process is resource intensive given that over 80% of all cases are of asylum origin and, as such, will have to have the Subsidiary Protection element of their case assessed before a final decision can be made under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This essentially means that there are two discrete decisions to be made in all such cases with different criteria to be applied in the two situations. Cases of non-asylum origin i.e. the remaining 20% of cases will not have a Subsidiary Protection element and, as such, will not take the same level of processing time.The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) provides accommodation to persons at all stages of the asylum and related processes. It would not be possible to specifically identify the cost to RIA of a particular cohort within the overall accommodation population, such as ‘ leave to remain applicants'. However, the outturn for RIA for all accommodation provided in 2009 was €86.509m.

It is a very complex issue and a broad range of action is being taken across the country by many State and Non-State organisations to prevent and respond effectively to this often hidden crime. A clear signal of government concern and commitment to this matter was the establishment in June 2007 of Cosc — the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated ‘ whole of government' response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Earlier this year Cosc completed its priority work on the development of the first National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014.  The strategy was developed through a thorough process of research and consultation with interested stakeholders from State, Non-governmental organisations and the broader community. Following approval by the Government last February, the national strategy was published in March and is now being implemented.  The strategy aims to prevent the violence concerned and to respond effectively to such violence. Ultimately the impact of the strategy will be fewer victims of domestic violence, better services for those who are victims and increased accountability by perpetrators of the violence.More specifically the national strategy contains clear actions to promote a culture of prevention and recognition through increased understanding of domestic violence and to deliver an effective service to those affected by domestic violence. Among these actions are ones which: manage risks posed by, and strengthen measures to deal with, perpetrators of domestic violence; update the law on domestic violence to give further protection to victims; examine the option of a one-stop-shop for greater accessibility of services to victims; and ensure improved opportunities for disclosure of domestic violence.These actions under the strategy will be delivered by the state agencies within whose remit the actions fall.  Steps have been taken to ensure efficient progress on the implementation of the actions.  A Strategy Oversight Committee meets twice-yearly to review progress.  The Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, includes senior officials from key government departments and state agencies responsible for implementing actions in the strategy.  In addition progress on the implementation of the strategy will be encouraged and monitored by Cosc on an ongoing basis.Through this national strategic framework and the commitment of government departments and state bodies, working in partnership with all the relevant NGOs, I am confident that substantial progress can be made in this area.

In general, it is not an offence, to purchase sex either. Consequently, neither party to the transaction is currently criminalised.In this jurisdiction, the criminal law governing prostitution is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective, while also seeking to protect prostitutes from exploitation.Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution. The offence can be committed by the prostitute, client or a third party — a pimp, for example.  The Act also provides for offences such as organising prostitution, coercing or compelling a person to be a prostitute, knowingly living on the earnings of a prostitute, or keeping or managing a brothel.In addition, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 makes it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would require very careful consideration.

I am further informed that no complaint has been received by the Gardaí in respect of the alleged photographing of crew members of the ship Rachel Corrie.Nevertheless, if any person has credible information that any alleged criminal activity has taken place, they should report their concerns to the Garda Síochána.  The Gardaí will conduct an investigation into any grounded allegation of criminal activity using all the statutory powers available to them in pursuit of their functions to preserve peace and public order and to prevent, detect and investigate breaches of the criminal law.With regard to the Deputy's assertion of clandestine operations being carried out by a foreign State, the House will readily understand why it would not be appropriate for me to comment in any way on the nature or extent of Garda operations or investigations, in particular those which might be related to counter-intelligence.As to the issue of the misuse of Irish passports to which the Deputy also refers, the Government has made very clear its strong objection to what occurred and, following consideration of the proposal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, requested Israel to withdraw a member of its staff from its Embassy in Dublin.  I would refer the Deputy to the comprehensive statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this regard of 15 June 2010.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2010, up to 24 June, ten gang related murders were recorded.  In addition, the House will be aware of the two appalling killings in Ronanstown last Monday evening.I deplore all such killings.  They are further evidence of the callous disregard for human life and community safety shown by members of criminal gangs.The Gardaí are carrying out intensive investigations of all these killings and will devote all necessary resources to the investigations.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda Síochána in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for this year.It has to be accepted that, as is the case in every jurisdiction, there can be considerable difficulties for police investigators in obtaining evidence in relation to gangland murders.  Associates of a victim of a gangland killing are often criminals themselves and do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  There is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward.It was against that background that last year that I introduced a series of strong but necessary anti-gangland legislative measures, in particular the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act.I have consistently made it clear that inevitably it would take time for the full effects of that legislation to become clear.  An Garda Síochána has been making full use of the legislation since it has been enacted, to build up criminal cases against gangland figures.  It is painstakingly gathering evidence that is sufficient to satisfy the DPP to prosecute people in relation to gangland activities and that will stand up in court.  A number of persons are before the courts.  Two have been charged with directing the activities of a criminal organisation.  Six have been charged with participation offences.  Arrests under that legislation have also led to charges in relation to firearms and drug offences.  Other files are with the DPP and I am confident that, as the evidence accumulates against individuals, successful prosecutions will be taken.I have also introduced further significant legislative proposals, which are currently before the House, including the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) and Criminal Procedure Bills, and I will not hesitate to introduce further proposals if that becomes necessary. In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.The resources available to An Garda Síochána remain substantial, in spite of the pressure on the public finances.  The gross amount in the Garda Vote this year is €1.5 billion.  We have prioritised allocations for front line policing.  There are now almost 14,600 attested Garda members, and the overtime allocation is the same as for last year, at €80 million.  A new Garda recruitment campaign is commencing, and the Government has approved 170 Garda promotions as a derogation from the moratorium on promotions.

I was pleased that over 70 organisations and groups considered the topic important enough to submit written submissions, and that many followed up  those submissions with face-to-face meetings with the review team.  I have also indicated that I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval of policy proposals for a new gambling architecture in the State, following an evaluation of the material received.  The policy proposals, which I would intend to publish, will be based on an examination of the submissions received, as well as the recommendations contained in the Report of the Casino Committee, Regulating Gaming in Ireland, and, of course, consideration of modern gambling regulation.  The review team is currently engaged in developing the appropriate proposals for consideration.Any new policy aimed at modernising our gambling code must take account of the challenges and threats, but also opportunities, presented by new technologies, particularly the internet.  In addition, policy must also be premised on the three important considerations which are the hallmark of most well-regulated gambling codes.  These are:that young people and the vulnerable are protected;that gambling should in all respects be fairly and openly conducted; andthat gambling is kept free of crime.Following the settling of policy in relation to a new gambling architecture for the State, the House can expect the publication of legislative proposals in the normal course. As this will be the first comprehensive review of our gambling law, effectively since the enactment of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, it would be reasonable to expect that any new legislation would be complex and comprehensive.

This discretionary instrument makes provision for the Minister to approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner in order to address humanitarian issues such as, in this instance, giving birth to a child.Upon discharge from hospital the prisoner is returned to the Dóchas Centre to complete the remainder of her sentence and pursuant to Rule 17 of the Prison Rules 2007, the child may be admitted to the prison and remain with the mother in the prison until the child has reached twelve months of age. Only under exceptional circumstances can the child remain with the mother after the twelve month period has elapsed.There is a considerable level of support available for mothers and babies in the Dóchas Centre.  Provisions are made to facilitate new mothers keeping their infants with them in custody so as not to disrupt early bonding.  Each mother and child are provided with their own single room with en-suite facilities on their return to the Dóchas Centre after giving birth. Required items such as a cot, baby food, nappies etc. are also provided.There are currently four babies in the Dóchas Centre with their mothers.

The Commission is at present examining the Diocese of Cloyne, and the Government has extended its term to 31 October to allow this work to be completed.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Assistant Commissioner appointed by the Garda Commissioner to examine the findings of the Dublin Archdiocese report relating to the handling of complaints and investigations by both Church and State authorities and to carry out such investigations and enquiries as he deems appropriate is continuing his examination of the report.  He will complete his examination as expeditiously as possible, following which he will report his recommendations to the Commissioner.  When he does so, the Commissioner will consult with the Law Officers on issues arising in the context of criminal liability.I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is continuing its audit of Catholic dioceses to ensure that it, as the statutorily responsible body, is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the Church.  When the audit is completed, the HSE will submit its report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.Consideration of the results of these investigations will include consideration of what further actions require to be taken, including a possible extension of the Commission's remit.Bringing the perpetrators of child sexual abuse to justice, whenever and wherever the abuse occurred, must be the absolute priority.  I repeat my call and that of the Commissioner for any person, including any member of the clergy, who has any knowledge of such abuse to contact An Garda Síochána.

In 2009 the accommodation at Portlaoise was enhanced with the provision of additional accommodation.I have been further informed by the Office of Public Works that a number of possible options are being explored with regard to identifying a suitable site for the development of a new Divisional Headquarters for An Garda Síochána in Portlaoise.The provision of a new Garda station in Portlaoise will be progressed in the context of An Garda  Síochána's identified accommodation requirements and in the light of available resources.

The current Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, took up his appointment in January 2008. In his Interim Report, following his appointment, the Inspector stated that his tenure would be characterised by independence and fairness.  In keeping with the independence of the Office as and when  the Inspector considers it necessary to meet with me I am happy, where practicable,  to facilitate such meetings.My  Department has a policy of meeting informally with the Inspector at regular intervals throughout the year to bring him up to date with relevant  developments in penal policy. These meetings ensure that the Department and myself  are kept fully informed on any issues or concerns he may have about the effective operation of the prison system.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 65 together.Increased civilian support for the Garda Síochána does not exclusively take the form of one for one replacement of individual Gardaí with civilians. In some instances, civilianisation does indeed enable the direct replacement of sworn members, who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties, with civilian staff.  In many other cases however, it allows sworn members who would otherwise have to devote a very substantial part of their working day to performing administrative duties such as data entry about crime incidents which goes on the PULSE system to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties.  Civilian staff may also be recruited to perform new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in the Garda Síochána, for example as crime analysts or IT specialists. These are roles which did not exist in the Garda organisation until recently.On this account, and because of the significant restructuring of roles, functions and business areas that has taken place at all levels of the Garda Síochána in recent years, it is difficult to quantify the exact number of posts which were occupied by sworn members but which today are held by civilians. I can however confirm that since 2003 the number of civilians  in the Garda Síochána has risen from 1,063 to approximately 2,116 whole time equivalents. While this is still a lower proportion compared to some similar police services in other jurisdictions, the Deputies will be aware that the Commissioner is committed to increasing this number further as resources, within the current employment control framework, allow.The recommendations in the recent report of the Garda Inspectorate on resource allocation are being carefully examined so that the potential for maximising the use of civilians and in turn releasing members of An Garda Síochána for frontline policing can be realised.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	733	As I have previously indicated to the House, the report on Mountjoy Prison by the Inspector of Prisons has been considered by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service and his Senior Management Team.  A number of the Inspector's recommendations have been implemented or are in the course of being implemented, subject to the availability of resources.The newly refurbished Separation Unit has opened which facilitates an enhanced regime for protection prisoners including access to a full range of services including medical, gym facilities, probation service and chaplaincy service.  Prisoners in the Separation Unit now receive 2 hours of out of cell time for recreation in the yard and also a further period of out of cell time in the gym.Prison management have identified a suitable area in the Medical Unit as the most suitable location to establish a Vulnerable Persons Unit (VPU).  The Irish Prison Service hope to hold discussions with the Prison Officers Association in the near future with regard to advancing this initiative.The Irish Prison Service introduced a new prisoner's complaints procedure in January, 2010.  The main points of the new policy are:all complaints and allegations are acted upon and investigated and acknowledgements issued no later than 7 working days.Prisoners have easy access to complaint forms and a method of submitting complaints directly to the Governor.Any allegation of excessive use of force should be reported to the Governor immediately and the Gardaí notified.An efficient and effective record system to be put in place and maintained including a standardised journal.The ambitious prison capital programme currently underway will result in the replacement and/or refurbishment of nearly 40% of the entire prison estate and the ending of ‘slopping out'.Overall, there has been major progress in recent years in terms of addressing and eliminating the problems presented by slopping-out.  The final elimination of the remaining outdated accommodation, mainly at Mountjoy and Cork Prisons, and to a lesser degree at Portlaoise and Limerick is dependent on the progress of the Thornton Hall and Kilworth Projects.  When the new wing in Wheatfield Prison opens, 72% of our accommodation will have in-cell sanitation.In relation to Mountjoy Prison specifically it should be noted that 340 of the cells are single occupancy and toilet patrols are in place until 10pm.  The option to introduce toilet patrols through the night would not be cost-neutral as it would require extra staff to be on duty and the Irish Prison Service simply does not have the resources necessary to escort prisoners to the toilets at times when prisoners are locked in their cells.  Where possible and where security considerations allow, staff on night duty will allow prisoners to go to the toilet during the night.A new Hygiene & Cleanliness drive has been operating on the B and C Divisions over the past month or so and will be rolled out across the prison. The purpose of this project is to ensure that general standards of hygiene in the prison are elevated and maintained to a higher standard.All of this planned activity in regard to raising hygiene standards has had a highly visible and positive effect in the Prison improving both prisoner and staff morale.  The Inspector of Prisons and the Visiting Committee have made favourable remarks with regard to same. I want to compliment Mountjoy staff and inmates alike for their efforts and success in this respect.At the time of the publication of the Inspectors report I indicated that with the addition of 50 new spaces in the Separation Unit it is my intention, in so far as is practicable, to keep the prison population of Mountjoy under 600.However, this has not been  possible to-date given current levels of committals, but the opening of the Wheatfield block later this year is expected to give some respite in this regard.  It should be noted that Mountjoy Prison, with 340 single cells, has the highest number of single cells of all prisons in the State.  In addition, while the stated capacity of Mountjoy is 590 there is accommodation available to hold in excess of that number when necessary.The Inspector of Prisons, in his 2008 Annual Report, acknowledged that overcrowding in prisons is an international problem and is not unique to Ireland.  The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 in excess of 1,720 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.Current projects will see in excess 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new block in Wheatfield.  In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approximately 50 spaces and is due to be completed in late 2010.I want to reiterate that I personally and my colleagues in Government are acutely aware of the limitations of the existing Mountjoy Prison.  That is why the decision was taken to replace it with a completely new prison campus on a green field site at Thornton, North County Dublin.  I am determined to push ahead with the Thornton project but in the intervening period, it is necessary to maintain Mountjoy as a prison and an institution run to the highest possible standards of hygiene and humanity.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	734	Policy on affording protections for whistleblowers generally is not a matter solely for myself as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As I indicated in the Dáil, on 16 June 2010, in the course of the Committee Stage Debate on the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008, it has been Government policy for some years to provide protection for whistleblowers  on a sectoral basis, that is to say that legislation should, where appropriate, contain provisions providing protection for persons reporting suspected offences in good faith.  There is ample evidence of this policy in practice.  Within the remit of my own Department, the Garda Síochána (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, apply to members of the Garda Síochána and relevant civilian staff, and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008, contains provisions for  protection of whistleblowers in respect of reported suspicion of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889-2005. The Property Service (Regulation) Bill 2009 which was recently passed by the Seanad and is awaiting second stage in the Dáil also contains a whistleblower's protection provision.I am aware that a significant number of statutes containing whistleblower protection provisions, which are the responsibility of a range of Departments, have been enacted in recent years. They include, the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995-2001, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, Health Act 2007,  the Consumer Protection Act 2007,  and the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007.  More recently, the Chemicals Act 2008, the Charities Act 2009 and the National Asset Management Agency Act, 2009,  also included these provisions. I understand that there are  a number of other Bills which have been published and which have yet to be enacted which have similar provisions.  Any future change to the sectoral approach to this issue will be a matter for collective Government consideration.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	735	The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner and establishes the criteria to be applied.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences, in addressing humanitarian issues and can be an incentive to well-behaved prisoners. It should be noted that a prisoner on temporary release is still subject to his or her sentence and may be returned to prison without any court intervention.Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including:the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relatesthe sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposedthe period of the sentence served by the personthe potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be releasedthe person's previous criminal recordthe risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary releasethe conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary releaseany report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda Síochána, a Probation & Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary releasethe risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary releasethe risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary releasethe likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.Temporary release arrangements are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.

Submissions are invited from members of the public and other interested parties in connection with each document and a range of consultation seminars are also being held.The first two documents have dealt with Crime Prevention and Community Safety and Criminal Sanctions respectively.  Two further documents are planned, the first of which will deal with Organised, Economic and White Collar Crime and will be published this summer.  A fourth document will examine the relationship between the community and the criminal justice system and is scheduled for publication at the end of the year.   Consultation seminars will complement each document, as with the first two documents.The outcome of this consultative process will feed into the final White Paper itself, which will set out the overall policy framework for strategies to combat crime into the future.Further information on the White on Crime process can be found on my Department's website, along with copies of the discussion documents and summaries of the input received thus far.  Interested parties can also register for updates by emailing whitepaperoncrime@justice.ie.

This report is available on the IYJS website — www.iyjs.ie . Equivalent information for 2009 will be published shortly in the 2009 Annual Report.With regard to current year, I can inform the Deputy that twelve million euro has been allocated for the one hundred GYDPs for 2010. This includes nearly four million euro under an ESF-supported employability programme. The number of project participants is expected to be in excess of 4,500 young persons.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 89 together.There are a number of provisions in the law for ensuring that payments continue to be made by spouses in support of their dependent spouses and children.  They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.While the law generally operates successfully in this area I am aware that difficulties have arisen in some cases because of the effect of a judgment of the High Court last year. The High Court judgment in that particular case had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940. The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes in the law consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.I am currently in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for amendments in respect of maintenance enforcement which I hope to include in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	740	I am fully aware of the issue referred to by the Deputy.  Re-entry visas are processed by Re-entry Visa Public Office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  The Public office processes over 60,000 re-entry visa applications a year.  The Public Office normally offers a fast, efficient service and deals with everyone who calls into the office on any given day.  However, the last few weeks has seen an unprecedented surge in business and there have been more callers to the office every day than the office can cope with.   As result the Public office has had to turn people away.As an alternative it is open to persons requiring a re-entry visa to apply by post.  Applicants are encouraged to make a postal application rather than calling to the office.While the problem was not caused by industrial action, measures to deal with the problem were affected by the work to rule operated by the Union for the clerical staff concerned.  This work to rule has now been suspended and my Department have taken additional steps to deal with the unprecedented spike in demand, including the assignment of additional staff into the relevant office.  It is anticipated that the action taken by my Department will result in the gradual return to normal service for this office over the next few days.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development, including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in March of this year and tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus. The detailed appraisal is underway in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Expenditure Guidelines and the new business case is at an advanced stage of preparation.As the Deputy will fully appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts who are independent in the exercise of their functions. I have already acknowledged that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 429. This represents a rise of over 11%  in the numbers in custody. This is due, in part, to the work of the Garda Síochána in bringing people to justice and the work of the courts process.Indeed the issues of overcrowding is not unique to this country. It is an international problem as acknowledged by the  Inspector of Prisons, in his 2008 Annual Report. The Government has invested significant resources in the overall criminal justice system. This level of investment has allowed the Irish Prison Service to set in train an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure.  Since 1997 close to 1,800 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.Current projects will see in excess 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new block in Wheatfield which is ready for occupation.  In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will when complete, provide in excess of 300 spaces. Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approximately 50 spaces and is due to be completed later this year.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	742	The Irish Prison Service as part of their policy "Keeping Drugs Out of Prison" continue to expand the range of drug treatment services available in prisons.  Significant investment has been committed in recent years to respond to addiction issues in the prison system.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non statutory organisations.   Anyone seeking drug treatment is assessed and an opinion is formed as to the most appropriate treatment and arising from that necessary actions are taken which can include referral to a particular service.I wish to inform the Deputy that it is not possible to provide details as requested due to the multifaceted approach taken by the Irish Prison Service and external agencies to address substance misuse issues within the prisons.As part of the assessment process on committal, prisoners giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids are offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated. At that stage or at any time during their incarceration healthcare staff are available to discuss other treatment options.  There were 2487 treatment episodes using methadone substitution in 2009 which has increased from 1579 since 2006.  Prisoners also have access to a range of medical and rehabilitative services such as psychosocial services and ‘ work and training' options, which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.Currently the Irish Prison Service provides drug treatment for in excess of 650 prisoners nationally per month. Methadone maintenance treatment in Irish prisons such as Mountjoy, Wheatfield and Cloverhill provide levels of coverage comparable to some of the highest levels of provision of methadone treatment in other European prisons. The Irish Prison Service has identified and treated almost 31% of all new entrants to the Central Treatment List in 2009.  As such prisons play a leading role engaging new patients into drug treatment services.In Mountjoy, in excess of 250 prisoners are currently on methadone substitution treatment. Mountjoy has initiated a programme involving addiction nurses, professional drug treatment pharmacy service, and a clinical addiction team with consultant oversight. This has resulted in a more streamlined service, better assessment and through care outcomes.As part of the National Drugs Strategy (interim) 2009 — 2016 a number of actions have been identified including  Action 43 which provides (and I quote): "Continue the expansion of treatment, rehabilitation and other health and social services in prisons.  Develop an agreed protocol for the seamless provision of treatment services as a person moves between prison (including prisoners on remand) and the community".Irish Prison Service Healthcare staff work closely with community based addiction services to facilitate continuity of methadone substitution treatment between prison and community for prisoners post release.  The development of drug treatment services in prisons have contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of post release overdose as there is a strong emphasis on continuity of care between prison services and community services.

On 14 June records at the National Garda Drug Unit showed 44 headshops operating.The situation is being closely monitored by the Commissioner, his senior Management team and D/Chief Superintendent, Garda National Drugs Unit.As the Deputy is aware I last week progressed the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 through the Seanad and it is intended to have this legislation enacted before the recess.Under the Bill, the sale or supply of substances which are not specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have psychoactive effects, for human consumption will be a criminal offence.The Bill will give appropriate powers to An Garda Síochána and the courts to intervene quickly to prevent outlets from selling these products by way of appropriate prohibition orders. The Scheme will also contain full search and seizure powers for the Gardaí and Revenue's Customs Service. The Bill is part of the Government's multi-pronged approach targeting the activities of head shops.

This report is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the website of the Irish Youth Justice Service ( www.iyjs.ie ). Equivalent information for 2009 will be published shortly in the 2009 Annual Report.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	745	A number of the measures in the Special Group Report (McCarthy) have been implemented at this stage in order to achieve reductions in the Departments Estimates for 2010.  These relate to the programmes in a range of subheads which include Gender Mainstreaming, Graffiti Removal Operations, Equality Monitoring Consultative Committees, European Refugee Fund and Refugee Integration.  The McCarthy Report  recommended a total reduction of some €5 million in respect of these particular items.  The actual budgetary reduction was €6.92 million.A significant proportion of the recommendations (€84 million) related to reductions in payroll costs on items such as allowances payable to members of the Garda Síochána and the Prisons Service.In common with all Departments, there are significant reductions in payroll related provisions in 2010 to take account of the reductions in payroll rates and other factors.  The overall reduction in gross payroll budgets for the Justice Sector compared with the 2009 estimate is in the region of €126 million.A number of recommendations were made by the McCarthy Group on structural  reform and rationalisation across the Justice and Equality Sector.  Decisions in respect of many of these recommendations will be a matter for decision by Government in due course and expenditure reductions that may arise will be included in the budget for the Sector in future years.  The Deputy will be aware of the recent transfer of functions in relation to the Equality, Disability, Integration and Human Rights areas from my Department to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.

While there was a significant increase in retirements in 2009, the rate of retirement has since slowed, with some 61 applications for early retirement received so far this year.The strength of An Garda Síochána as of 31st May 2010, the latest date on which figures are readily available was 14,571.  There has been a very considerable increase in Garda resources in recent years, with the number of attested members rising from 11,895 at the end of 2002, to 13,755 at the end of 2007 and, currently to 14,571.  Some 900 student Gardaí were attested in 2009 and there have been more attestations in 2010.  There are now also over 2,100 civilian support staff  (Whole Time Equivalent) in the Garda Síochána, an increase of over 300 compared to the start of 2008.  There are also some 555 Garda Reserve members in the Force with an additional 83 due to be attested in the coming days.While the moratorium on appointments and promotions applies generally to the Garda Síochána, there have been 227 promotions so far in An Garda Síochána this year and there are currently competitions being held for the promotion of Chief Superintendent to the rank of Assistant Commissioner and Sergeant to the rank of Inspector, which are expected to be finalised shortly.When Garda trainees are recruited into the Garda college will depend on the level of Garda retirements.  The objective will be to recruit sufficient numbers of trainees so as to maintain Garda strength at the approved level.With specific regard to Galway Garda Division, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of that Division as at 31 December 2009 and 31 May 2010 was 600 and 602 respectively.Maintaining the operational strength of An Garda Síochána at the approved level is my absolute priority, and I am very pleased that we are making the necessary preparations now in holding a recruitment competition so that this policy can be sustained into the future.YearA/CommissionerC/SuptSuptInspSgtGdaTOTAL20022694816923420031640205252200424666245323200528106220228420063895416423820077636128177200811213521742432009114252917747472031/05/20102154461
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The number of offences being committed by persons on bail is a matter of concern.  The operation of the legislation relating to bail is kept under continuing review by my Department, and proposals for amendment of the legislation are brought forward when that is considered necessary.  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.Statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office indicate that in 2009 there were 27,228 offences recorded where the suspected offender was on bail, which represents a reduction of 8% on the figure for the previous year.Towards the end of last year, I obtained Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill.  The Bill will restate and consolidate bail law.  In addition, a number of matters to improve the operation of the law are being examined.  These include:(a) providing that the courts must have regard to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person or the public posed by the release of the accused person on bail;(b) creating presumptions that bail should be refused for people charged with certain types of serious crime.  In view of restrictions resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights, such presumptions would act as a form of guidance to the courts in identifying those who present unacceptable risks of committing serious offences if granted bail; and(c) extending the powers of the courts to refuse bail where that is necessary to prevent the commission of further offences to include more minor offences which fall below the current level of seriousness required by the Bail Act 1997.I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government later this year.

Their purpose is to provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting their area.On 24 September, 2008, I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, guidelines for the Committees, which took into account the experience gained during a pilot phase and provided for the establishment of Committees in all 114 local authority areas by the relevant local authorities and the Garda Commissioner.  I have asked the Garda authorities for details of the Committees established to date and when they are to hand I will contact the Deputy.

I am further informed that of these 567 persons 509 have been recorded as found.I am also informed by the Garda authorities that compiling statistics prior to June 2009 on foreign nationals reported as missing would necessitate a manual examination of records and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.The figures provided are operational and liable to change.

The selected supplier has responsibility for ensuring monitoring and survey sessions are conducted in accordance with the schedules and procedures drawn up by An Garda Síochána and the provision of the resulting survey and monitoring data to An Garda Síochána.  The selected supplier will provide the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operators.The service provider will be paid according to the level of service contracted for.  The number of speeding drivers detected will have no effect on the level of payments to the service provider.  The purpose of the contract is to reduce speed, and so increase road safety, and not to generate revenue either for the State or the service provider.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	751	Details of the number of Deportation Orders signed and effected in the period 1st January 2008 to 31st May 2010 are set out in the following table.YearNumber of Deportation Orders SignedNumber of Deportation Orders Effected200875716120091,0772912010353126Total2,187578Under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may make a deportation order that requires any foreign national specified in the order to leave the State within such period as may be specified in the order and to remain thereafter out of the State.  Thus, a deportation order is a requirement imposed on a person to leave the State and to remain outside of the State.However, a deportation order is normally accompanied by a notice requiring the person concerned to comply with arrangements to ensure that he or she leaves the State.  Failure to comply with those arrangements is an offence and can result in the person being arrested and detained to ensure his or her removal from the State.The figures for ‘ Deportation Orders effected' quoted above reflects the numbers of deportations that have been enforced, however, it is generally accepted that many other persons served with a deportation order leave the State at that stage but do not inform the immigration authorities of their departure.Furthermore, the enforcement of some deportations can be delayed by judicial challenges taken by the parties involved.Overall, the level of evasion, the lodgement of judicial challenges and the likely voluntary departure from the State of persons served with a deportation order would explain why a significant proportion of deportation orders appear not to have been effected.The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill provides for a range of measures which will streamline the deportation process and improve effectiveness -the Bill provides that a person who is unlawfully in the State will be under an obligation to leave; and a failure to leave may result in removal of the person from the State, if necessary against his or her will and if necessary with arrest and detention for that purpose.  Under current law, a person who is unlawfully in the State can, notwithstanding that unlawfulness and irrespective of the circumstances in which that unlawfulness arose, not be removed until the process under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 is undertaken, leading to the making of a deportation order;the Bill includes provision which will require a person who has been subject to removal and who wishes to return to Ireland, to repay the cost to the State before he/she is allowed to return;the Bill provides that a person who has been subject to removal will automatically be ineligible for permission to enter the State for 6 months from the date of removal;the Bill includes  provision limiting access to State-funded services by persons unlawfully present in the State;the Bill includes provision whereby a person whose presence in the State is unlawful will be liable, on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.  The person will also be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €500 for each day that he or she continues to remain in the State thereafter

An Garda Síochána also has access to the National Vehicle File, which provides vehicle registration information.Since 2008 An Garda Síochána has had the ability, through an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, to check vehicles recorded on the Garda PULSE system and identify vehicles as having been stolen, in addition to vehicles which are suspect, connected with persistent offending, untaxed and uninsured.  This information alerts the Gardaí using the system and enables an interception to be made.As part of its traffic law enforcement, An Garda Síochána pursues the drivers of dangerously defective vehicles.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I am pleased to say that there are now 555 attested Garda Reserve members with an additional 180 student Reserves in training, 83 of whom are expected to graduate this coming Friday.  Garda Reserve members are allocated to Garda stations throughout the country, a list of which I am circulating with this answer.The Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full time strength of the Force.  As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Garda Commissioner is continuing to make every effort to reach the recruitment target and it is important to note that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.Recruitment is ongoing and the Public Appointments Service has received over 7,000 expressions of interest to join the Reserve since the start of this year.  The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.  It has been a very successful initiative and I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.The Garda Commissioner is responsible for determining the range of powers and duties of Reserve members, and I am sure that he will keep these under review in line with the recommendation of the Inspectorate.StationTotal

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The judiciary has been developing, under a pilot project, a system to gather relevant criteria and to allow access to information about the range of sentences and other penalties which have been imposed for particular types of offence.  This will be a valuable support to judges when considering the sentence to be imposed in an individual case.  The pilot project is overseen by a steering committee, established by the Courts Service Board and chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court.  I understand a number of pilot projects have been run in several court jurisdictions, including Dublin, Cork and Limerick Circuit Criminal Courts; the Dublin District Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The outcomes will be reviewed and assessed by judges prior to final evaluation and establishment of a website.  I understand it is envisaged that, in addition to the case content, which is being compiled following consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner, the website will contain references to leading cases on sentencing, summaries and links to significant judgments on sentencing law, some statistical data and academic material on sentencing.As I have previously informed the House, I have contacted the Attorney General in regard to the issue of mandatory sentences generally and he has formally requested the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue.  I understand that this issue is included in the Commission's programme of work for 2010.I should add that the Criminal Justice Act 1993 (as amended by section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006) provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed by a court for a crime on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is, of course, independent in the carrying out of his functions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The figures available at the end of May 2010 show that there are 1,068 members of the Garda Síochána specifically assigned to community policing out of a total attested strength of 14,571.  By comparison, at the end of 2007, 630 members were assigned to community policing, and the present number represents an increase of almost 70% on that figure.  The Deputy will of course be aware that policing in local communities, either rural or urban, is a matter for all Gardaí and not just those assigned to the roles of community policing.All members who are assigned to community policing operate on a full-time basis.  These members are specifically tasked with the duty of liaising with communities within their policing Districts.  The new Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing was launched early in 2009.  This new model is about  renewing, re-invigorating and re-structuring  the community policing function within the Garda Síochána to deliver:a consistent national structure to the community policing function;a  more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community; andthe spread of good practices and quality service in community policing on a national basis;The national strategies for Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert, both of which were launched in 2007, will also inform the organisation on how best to implement future crime prevention programmes and community policing programmes.A National Community Policing Office has been established within Garda Community Relations Section to develop and oversee the implementation programme.  The model is being rolled out nationwide in line with an action plan which has been developed for implementation.  Training is ongoing and it is intended that every District Officer throughout the country will take ownership of community policing within his or her area of responsibility.  The Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing Report is available on the Garda website  www.garda.ie.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	758	As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 entered into force, in its entirety, on 23 July 2009.  The primary purpose of the legislation, together with the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, is to make additional measures available to An Garda Síochána to combat organised crime.Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crimes.  Given the serious nature of the offences dealt with under the legislation in question a full and thorough investigation of individuals and their activities is necessary and must be conducted before charges can be brought against them.  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that the Gardaí are utilising the legislation fully.I am advised by An Garda Síochána that as a result of investigations focusing on organised crime a number of Garda investigation files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction.  Between 23rd July 2009 and 21st June, 2010, there have been 69 arrests for offences contrary to the Criminal Justice Amendment Act 2009.  Four people have already appeared before the Courts charged with offences under the legislation relating to participation in organised crime activity.  Given that these cases are now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána will continue to utilise all resources available to them in order to combat the activities of those engaged in criminality of all forms.  As Minister, I remain fully committed to supporting them in their ongoing efforts and will ensure that the necessary resources are made available as and when they may be required.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	759	The Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010, which was passed by the Seanad last week and is currently before this House, is part of the Government's multi-pronged approach targeting the sale of unregulated psychoactive substances.  The primary vehicles for regulating psychoactive substances are the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2007.  On foot of the Government Order of 11 May 2010, the Minister for Health and Children made the necessary statutory instruments to make the possession and sale of certain substances subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  The regulations covered the mainstream of substances then commonly being sold in head shops and by means of the internet.  I understand that the Minister for Health and Children is monitoring closely the emergence of new psychoactive substances and will seek Government approval to ban additional substances if they pose a risk to public health.However, experience has shown that new psychoactive substances can quickly emerge and there will always be a time lag before such new substances can be made subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  This Bill will therefore introduce more general control by way of criminal justice legislation to deal with such substances as they emerge.  The focus of the Bill is on seeking to ensure that the sale or supply of substances, which may not be specifically controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have psychoactive effects, for human consumption will be a criminal offence.  The Bill will also give appropriate powers to the Gardaí and to the courts to intervene quickly to prevent the sale of psychoactive substances by way of prohibition notices and prohibition orders.  Section 3 of the Bill provides for the offences of selling, importing and exporting psychoactive substances for human consumption.  The definition of "sale" is broad and includes supplying, distributing, offering for sale, inviting to buy and being in possession for sale.  It will cover sale over the internet or home delivery services within this jurisdiction.Section 5 will prohibit the advertising of psychoactive substances.  It provides that it will be an offence for a person to publish or display any advertisement knowing or being reckless as to whether it indicates an intention to sell, import or export a psychoactive substance for human consumption.  It will also be an offence to publish an advertisement promoting the consumption of a substance for its psychoactive effect and providing information on how or where a psychoactive substance may be obtained.  The term "advertisement" is broadly defined and specifically includes advertising by electronic communication, including by means of the internet.  Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill will give appropriate powers to the Gardaí and to the courts to intervene quickly in a non-criminal procedure to prevent the sale or advertisement of psychoactive substances by way of appropriate prohibition notices and orders.

I am pleased to note that GSOC has carried out a re-structuring of  its Divisions  which has had the effect of producing greater efficiencies  and resulted in the virtual elimination of the pre-admissibility backlog which had built up in the early months of operational activity.  This in turn has led to a situation where complainants and Gardaí received a speedier response to complaints and queries.  I note that GSOC hope to review these effects in 2010 with a view to further enhancing the output of the organisation and to improving further the service to all stakeholders.  In accordance with section 80 (6) of the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007, the Report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in May of this year and is available in the Oireachtas Library.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	761	I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the period 1998 to 2010 (to 24 June) 196 murders involving a firearm were recorded.  To date proceedings have commenced in 58 of these cases, and 24 convictions secured.  All cases of murder where proceedings have not yet been taken remain under active Garda investigation.  The detection rate by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore, such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.I am, of course, deeply concerned about the incidence of gun murders and I deplore all such killings.  All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda Síochána in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the Force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is also reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for this year, and specific initiatives, including under Operation Anvil and involving members of the Emergency Response Unit, have been put in place.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently a number of initiatives underway targeting the activities of organised crime groups, the focus of which is to gather evidence which will support effective prosecutions, including under the new anti-gangland legislation.While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, the reality is that there can be considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities from associates of a victim of a gangland killing or indeed from gangland figures, even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in its investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.It was in that overall context that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda Síochána.  I am pleased to see that criminal charges are being brought under the new legislation.  An Garda Síochána has submitted further files to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and more are being prepared for submission to him.  I have also introduced further significant legislative proposals, which are currently before the House, including the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) and Criminal Procedure Bills, and I will not hesitate to introduce further proposals if that becomes necessary.In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  There are already very severe penalties for firearms offences in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and using a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Possessing a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, possessing a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, carrying a firearm with criminal intent and altering a firearm carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.

The findings of the Review suggest that participants who engage with the Drug Treatment Court programme have reduced rates of recidivism and improved health, education and social skills which impact positively on the participants and the community. However the Review did concur with my own view that the very low throughput of participants is an issue.  I am pleased therefore, that the Report identified a number of recommendations designed to improve the programme's throughput and effectiveness.  The Report, which is available on my Department's website, also includes a recommendation that "Existing catchment area boundaries should be removed on a phased basis".  Based on the findings of the Review it is intended that the Drug Treatment Court will continue its operations for a further two years.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	763	I am informed by the Garda Commissioner, that following the publication of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Resource Allocation, Deputy Commissioner Strategy and Change Management was appointed to consider the report and to co-ordinate an agreed and pragmatic programme of work to advance the implementation of the twenty-seven recommendations.  My officials will work closely with the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate on implementation of the recommendations in order to maximise efficient allocation of Garda resources.  While every effort will be made to progress the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Resource Allocation, it is recognised by both An Garda Síochána and the Garda Inspectorate that, due to the current economic situation, there is limited scope to fund change proposals.  Where recommendations involve significant capital costs, interim measures, where possible, will be considered until such time as funding is available for full implementation.  However, implementation of some recommendations will not require capital investment and I am keen to make progress, in particular, on necessary revision of Garda rosters and examine station opening hours as key measures to improve the matching of Garda resources to the demand for policing services.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	764	There are a number of provisions in the law for ensuring that payments continue to be made by spouses in support of their dependent spouses and children.  They include enabling powers for the courts to order attachment of the earnings of a debtor spouse, to order the securing of payments to the maintenance creditor, to order the payment of lump sums and to order arrears of maintenance to be paid by instalments.  While the law generally operates successfully in this area I am aware that difficulties have arisen in some cases because of the effect of a judgment of the High Court last year.  The High Court judgment in that particular case had implications for sections 6 (imprisonment in the case of non-payment of debt) and 8 (imprisonment relating to non-payment of maintenance) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.  The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009 made changes in the law consequent on that judgment in accordance with legal advice.  I am currently in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to developing early proposals for amendments in respect of maintenance enforcement which I hope to include in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	765	I am aware of the comments made by the retiring Governor of Mountjoy Prison as referred to in your question.  Mountjoy Prison is a Victorian prison which is now 160 years old.  I accept that conditions in Mountjoy Prison are not ideal but I do not accept that conditions are inhumane.  Deputies on all sides accept the need to replace  the entire Mountjoy complex with a modern, regime focused campus at Thornton Hall and the Government and I are fully committed to this project.  The need for prisoners who request protection to be accommodated in separate areas from other identified persons from whom they may be at risk is of primary importance.  The renovated Separation Unit has opened and includes 50 new spaces for protection prisoners.  Prisoners in the Separation Unit have access to a full range of services including medical, gym facilities, the probation service and the chaplaincy service.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to transfer protection prisoners out of Mountjoy Prison to other locations where they would not require such a restricted regime, e.g. protection landings in Wheatfield or the Midlands Prisons or to another prison where they would not require protection.As I have freely acknowledged it  is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 429.  This represents a rise of over 11%  in the numbers in custody.  The Inspector of Prisons, in his 2008 Annual Report, acknowledged that overcrowding in prisons is an international problem, which is not unique to Ireland.  The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 close to 1,800 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.Current projects will see in excess 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new block in Wheatfield.  In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approximately 50 spaces and is due to be completed later this year.  The new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.  The development is now proceeding on a phased basis.The IPS focuses on providing prisoners with the range and access of drug treatment options which is equivalent to that available in the community. At present, any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options.  These may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  Drug treatment programmes currently in place in prisons, including Mountjoy, seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation.  In Mountjoy initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and ‘work and training' options, which assist in addressing their substance misuse issues.There are currently in excess of 250 prisoners in Mountjoy on methadone substitution treatment. Mountjoy has initiated a programme involving addiction nurses, a professional drug treatment pharmacist service, and a clinical addiction team with consultant oversight.  This has resulted in a more streamlined service, better assessment and through care outcomes.   The Medical Unit in Mountjoy Prison has 9 places specifically allocated for the therapeutic drug free programme.  This programme is 6 weeks in duration; the model used is a collaborative one using prison based staff and the community/ voluntary sector.  Its aim is to assist prisoners in achieving a drug free status.  Significant investment has been committed in recent years to respond to addiction issues in the prison system including the awarding of a contract for the provision of addiction counselling services to Merchants Quay Ireland in 2008 (delivering approximately 1,500 prisoner contacts per month).  Given the large number of prisoners requiring drug treatment services, the IPS endeavours to provide a comprehensive range of such services in closed prisons including Mountjoy.

Subsequent investigations carried out by the Passport Service and by the Gardaí have confirmed that the eight Irish passports used were forgeries.  The Garda investigation into the matter is ongoing and if evidence is adduced to indicate the commission of criminal offences in this jurisdiction a file will be submitted to the DPP on completion of enquiries.

The Tribunal was established by the Oireachtas in May 2005 arising from the Weston Park Agreement between the Irish and British Governments in 2001.  The Tribunal is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick.  The Tribunal Chairman is independent in his functions in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.  The terms of the Resolutions of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the Regulation establishing the Tribunal provide for the submission of interim reports to the Clerk of the Dáil within 10 days of the commencement of oral hearings regarding the granting of representation before the Tribunal, progress to date, likely duration and any other matters which the Tribunal considers appropriate.  I am informed that the Tribunal is in an investigative phase at present.  It is expected that public hearings will take place later this year.  Questions such as whether the Tribunal has secured all the cooperation it requires are matters for the Tribunal itself and will, I have no doubt, be dealt with in the final report.

It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 429.  This represents a 11% increase in the numbers in custody.The Inspector of Prisons, in his 2008 Annual Report, acknowledged that overcrowding in prisons is an international problem, not just unique to Ireland. The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 in excess of 1,720 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  Current projects will see in excess 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new block in Wheatfield. In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term. Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approx 50 spaces and is due to be completed in late 2010.The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.  The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development, including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services.  Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in March of this year and tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.  Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus.  The detailed appraisal is underway in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Expenditure Guidelines and the new business case is at an advanced stage of preparation.The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences, in addressing humanitarian issues and can be an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.  It should be noted that a prisoner on temporary release is still subject to his or her sentence and may be returned to prison without any court intervention.  Temporary release arrangements are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	772	My Department and the Garda Síochána, in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General, have been considering proposals for a new system which would allow the taking of contemporaneous written notes to cease where interviews are electronically recorded.  There is, however, a complex range of training, technological and legal issues to be addressed before any changeover to a new system could  take place, and of course the financial implications would have to be carefully assessed.  Because of the complexities involved, it is likely that any new system would initially be introduced on a pilot basis to allow all the operational and legal aspects to be fully tested and evaluated.Following a recommendation made by the Morris Tribunal, I have established an Advisory Committee on Garda Interviewing of Suspects.  The Honourable Mr. Justice Edmond Smyth has kindly agreed to chair the committee.  He brings to the Committee not only his considerable learning and expertise as a Judge of the High Court, but also the knowledge and experience as Chairperson of the Steering Committee on Audio Video Recording which oversaw the introduction of electronic recording of Garda interviews of suspects.  The new Advisory Committee, which comprises representatives of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Garda Síochána, the Bar Council, the Law Society and my Department, is currently considering the legal, technical and operational issues involved in moving to a new system of interviewing without contemporaneous notes.  I will consider the views of the Advisory Committee on these matters before any pilot project is commenced.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	773	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of times the Garda Síochána called on the assistance of the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal team for the years 2007 to 2010 (to 28 June) are as set out in the following table:20072008200920109818019693I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period in question proceedings commenced in 18 cases.  Garda strategies in counteracting such activities are firmly focused on disrupting organised criminal groups and where sufficient evidence is adduced, proffering charges and bringing persons before the Courts.  One of the priorities I have set for the Garda Síochána in 2010 is combating serious crime, in particular organised crime.  Operation Anvil is an important nationwide operation to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime.  The primary focus of this Operation is to target active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	774	I wish to advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service facilitated the major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology which is the basis for the recidivism rates presented by the Irish Penal Reform Trust in its recent report.  This research analysed dated relating to over 19,000 prisoners in Ireland and  found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence with one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  The fact that over 50% of prisoners do not re-offend within four years of release, compares well internationally.  The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes with the dual aim of providing prisoners with purposeful activity for the period of the sentence and supporting them to lead more productive lives on release.Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant inputs from general and specialist services from within the Irish Prison Service and in-reach statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing a wide number of issues such  drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management.  The Irish Prison Service places a particular emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach and literacy, numeracy and general basic education is the main priority.  I am glad to say that a significant expansion of vocational training programmes has taken place in recent years .  We currently have over 90 workshops in place in our prisons capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.The Irish Prison Service is also delivering programmes aimed at reducing the demand for drugs within the prison system through enhanced security measures as well as education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  The introduction of Integrated Sentence Management system (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention is another important development.  As the Deputy knows the central aim of ISM is to move to a prisoner centred approach to the management of custodial sentences.  ISM is to identify, deliver and measure appropriate interventions to address the identified risks and needs of prisoners. ISM is currently operating in seven prisons, Arbour Hill, Midlands, St. Patrick's Institution, Training Unit, Wheatfield, Cork and Portlaoise.  Currently there are 350 Prisoners engaged in ISM.  It is intended to roll out ISM in all other prisons to all newly committed prisoners with sentences of one year and upwards during 2010.  It is recognised that  helping prisoners maintain links with family is vital. In this regard the Probation Service of my Department makes a significant contribution to supporting prisoners to prepare and reintegrate back to society.

I have been assured that such premises receive Garda attention and if breaches of the legislation are detected appropriate action is taken.  Again, I invite the  Deputy, if she has information about any specific breaches of the relevant provisions of the Acts, to bring this to the attention of the Gardaí, alternatively I would be happy to forward the information to the Garda authorities on her behalf.I recognise, of course, that the law governing gaming is somewhat outdated and could be modernised to reflect the realities of a modern gaming sector, including gaming over the internet.  The review of gambling underway in my Department therefore,  addresses reform of this and other sectors.  The consultation phase of the review has now been completed.  The review will, in due course, provide Government with options for a new and comprehensive legal and organisational framework governing the gambling architecture in the State.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have played a pivotal role in stimulating local economic development through sustaining and growing the micro enterprise sector across the country since their establishment.In addition to financial supports, micro-enterprises have been supported by the CEBs through a range of business advice, information, and mentoring services, as well as various management training and capability development programmes. The local focus of the CEBs  and their agile ability to respond quickly to local needs is a key aspect of the service which they provide to micro-enterprises.  Such a dedicated State support for the micro-enterprise sector should continue to be provided and should be delivered as close to the client as possible.The CEB structure has existed in its current form since 1993. In the context of the recommendations of the McCarthy Report and continuing pressures on the public finances and staffing resources, the time is now right to evaluate the appropriateness of this structure. It is imperative that we strive to exploit fully the potential for reducing administration and overhead costs, while ensuring that the provision of financial and other services to clients is maximised.Since my appointment as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I have been reflecting on what institutional arrangements might best deliver the necessary supports to micro-enterprise. My preliminary conclusions are that the separate legal structures of the 35 independent CEBs presents challenges in terms of administrative overheads, resource maximisation and staffing rigidities in responding to the impact of the recruitment embargo.  I am also examining the role of Enterprise Ireland and its relationship to the CEBs in supporting indigenous enterprise and the extent to which that agency may have a greater role to play in supporting micro-enterprise.  I will bring proposals to Government on this before the summer break.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation does not have any role or responsibility in this matter, nor in the area of fire prevention or planning.  Neither my Department nor the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) issues guidelines to Local Authorities in fire or planning matters.  I am not in a position to say whether or not chief fire officers or planning authorities are briefed on this or any other matter.I understand that, as an operational matter, if Local Authorities who are in receipt of licensing applications for petrol stations ask the HSA for their observations on particular aspects of applications, these are provided.  The manner and extent to which a Local Authority factors these observations into the process of deciding on a licence application, or briefs relevant officials and authorities, are matters for the Local Authority itself.

Bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area.  Any extension of betting duty will be applied on a fair basis and should not be perceived as an attempt to threaten jobs.  Also, tax changes will be in tandem with ongoing work by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on issues surrounding licensing and regulation.The Deputy will be aware that there has been an historic link between betting duty receipts and the funding of the horse-racing and greyhound sectors in recent years.  I would accept that bets placed on other sports such as football and golf represent an increasing share of sports betting generally.  However, horse-racing and the betting sector are inextricably linked — to some extent they are mutually dependent, a situation not replicated with other sports. Also, many reports have highlighted the importance of the horse-racing and greyhound sectors to the economy, particularly in parts of rural Ireland.

The SFT is a lifetime limit which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 at an initial level of €5 million and was increased in line with an indexation factor in 2007 and 2008 to its current value of just over €5.4 million. In line with the decision made in Budget 2009, there was no indexation of the SFT for 2009. Penal tax charges apply to any funds in excess of the threshold.The National Pensions Framework does not include specific proposals in relation to the SFT. I am aware, however, of the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on Taxation which, among other things, proposes a reduction in the level of the SFT. The current level of the threshold will be kept under review as part of the normal Budgetary and Finance Bill process.

I also have responsibility for implementing the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which provides funding to community services to enable them to charge reduced fees to disadvantaged and low income working parents.Services participating in the ECCE scheme receive an annual capitation fee from my Office for each eligible child attending.  Services participating in the CCSS receive annual funding in respect of each childcare place availed of by parents who qualify for a subvention payment.  Eligibility for the ECCE scheme is determined by reference to the age of the pre-school child.  Parents qualify for subvention if they are in receipt of social welfare payments, Family Income Support or would qualify for a medical or GP visit card.A number of other schemes are operated by other Government departments and State agencies.  Where possible, these are being co-ordinated into a single approach under my Office.  A recent example of this is the announcement of the new Childcare Employment and Training Scheme (CETS) which will be introduced in September of this year and which will replace the childcare support schemes currently implemented by FAS and the Vocational Education Committees, with a new enhanced provision for qualifying students and trainees.I am aware that the Health Service Executive (HSE) also funds a number of childcare services which have a particular focus on disadvantage including, in many cases, services which receive a significant number of children referred by the HSE.  An official from my Office met recently with the HSE to discuss ways in which to improve co-ordination of funding for the sector.  I  understand that the service referred to by the Deputy was advised by the HSE earlier this year that it would be reducing its funding this year, due to the introduction of the ECCE scheme, but that this is being reviewed.

Acute bed numbers in public hospitals are counted as an average of beds available over each year.  The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2007, the latest year for which validated data has been compiled by the HSE, was 13,688. This includes both in-patient beds and day places.  An average of approximately 20% of these are categorised as private beds.  My Department has requested the HSE to provide validated data on the national average number of acute hospital beds available in 2008 and 2009 to the Deputy as soon as these become available.

Because of changed economic circumstances, it will not now be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescales envisioned at its launch.  Overall transport investment priorities have been reviewed and these priorities are reflected in the Renewed Programme for Government. The Renewed Programme prioritises Metro North and the DART Underground as the key public transport projects for delivery in the coming years.I can confirm that it is also a priority to commit to  continue to progress planning on all other Transport 21 public transport projects to ensure that we will be in a position to move speedily to construction at the earliest possible date once financial resources permit. In this context, Phases 2 and 3 of the Western Rail Corridor remain a Government priority.  The next step will be for Iarnród Éireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of Phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	836	Changes to the cabotage entitlements of all haulage operators in the EU were introduced on 14 May 2010, as part of a package of measures adopted in December 2009.  Previously, cabotage was permitted on a "temporary basis", but the meaning of "temporary" was never legally defined, leading to different interpretations across Member States.EU legislation now clarifies that every operator is entitled to carry out three cabotage operations in a foreign Member State, within a seven-day period after they finish an inward loaded journey.  This new rule applies equally to non-Irish operators carrying goods in Ireland, as well as to Irish operators abroad.  The change in cabotage does not affect in any way an Irish operator's entitlement to carry goods between Member States — international journeys of vehicles carrying goods remain fully liberalised. Furthermore, cabotage accounts for approximately 1% of all freight transport by road in the EU, and about the same percentage of freight carried in Ireland.My Department has informed all Irish international haulage operators about the new rules, at the end of 2009 and again in April this year. In addition, my Department is examining whether some current practices, which developed under the previous interpretation, remain permissible under the new rule. I understand too that affected Irish hauliers are reviewing their own transport arrangements to comply with the change.Because a number of Irish hauliers operating to the UK in particular may be affected my Department has been in contact already with their UK counterparts and with the European Commission to establish a common understanding of how the rule change will affect work practices currently undertaken by hauliers generally as well as how it will be enforced.  The overall objective is to ensure that hauliers will know exactly what arrangements fall within the new rules and which do not, so that operators can plan their operations to the utmost economic efficiency. My Department will be in touch again with affected Irish hauliers following the discussions with the UK and the European Commission.

The construction phase of the new cell block at a cost of €29m  at Wheatfield was completed earlier this year. As is normal practice after completion of the main construction phase the fit-out, installation of equipment including medical, CCTV and locking systems was then commenced. This was completed in April 2010. I am glad to say that it is the intention of Irish Prison Service Management to bring the facility into occupation on a phased basis in a matter of weeks.Let me set the record straight on the kitchen facilities. Firstly it was recognised from the very outset of this project that additional kitchen capacity would be required in order to cater for the increased prisoner numbers resulting from the new cell block. There were two options available: either a refurbishment of the existing facilities or the provision of a new kitchen with increased capacity to cater for the entire Wheatfield complex. Having considered the various options it was decided to construct a new kitchen on a site close to the existing facility which would allow for the utilisation of some of the existing kitchen services including storage areas. This was considered the best option as it frees up an area currently occupied by the kitchen which will be utilised for staff changing and locker rooms.The new kitchen is due for completion in September next when it will become fully operational. In the interim there is ample capacity in the existing kitchen facilities at Wheatfield to cater for the opening of the new block which will,  as with all major new prison facilities, be managed on a phased basis with a gradual increase in prisoner numbers up to full capacity over a period of  months.

It is the policy of An Garda Síochána not to disclose the amount of money taken during such crimes.YearNo. of incidents recorded2009620081200732006220051Regular meetings are held between An Garda Síochána and Financial Institutions to discuss bank security issues and in particular tiger kidnapping prevention and response protocols. The response procedures in place for dealing with such incidents, which An Garda Síochána does not disclose as a matter of policy and security, typically include the establishment of Crisis Management teams and agreed protocols designed primarily to ensure the safe return of those persons held captive during such incidents and thereafter securing the arrests and prosecution of the culprits involved.  Advice on personal security for staff members and on systems and processes in place for the conveyance, storage and dispersal of cash are provided on an ongoing basis and are subject of regular review.An Garda Síochána does not, as a matter of policy and security, disclose information relating to the nature and exercise of security measures or the amounts of money taken during such incidents.The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner and I met with senior representatives of all the banks, including the one he identifies, late last year to discuss this issue. As charges have been preferred in relation to the incident on 22 June referred to by the Deputy I do not consider it appropriate to comment on the details of the case.  I can confirm, however, that contacts have taken place at a senior level between An Garda Síochána and the bank involved in relation to issues arising from the incident.

A copy these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre.Experience has shown that, given the nature and the number of such complaints, they are best resolved by informal discussion between residents and management at a local level.  Where more serious complaints arise that cannot be resolved informally, residents have the right to lodge a formal written complaint with centre management and are entitled to a response within 14 days.  If the issue remains unresolved, the resident has the right to take their complaint to RIA.  RIA will make a determination on the complaint and the results of that decision are binding on both centre management and residents.  If the resident's complaint is upheld, RIA will ensure that management take appropriate action to rectify the situation.I should say that rules and procedures were only recently revised arising from a report from a Working Party, the membership of which included the Refugee Information Service and the Irish Refugee Council.  During those Working Party discussions the issue of an independent appeals mechanism, on which differing views were held, was fully discussed.  The system of direct provision is sui generis and I am informed that the complaints resolution procedure above is considered to be the only one appropriate to the circumstances which obtain in that system.

The Office of Public Works is currently making arrangements to refurbish another station to accommodate personnel from the station referred to during the relevant period. The tender process for this refurbishment work has been completed and a contract has now been placed.I am assured by the Garda authorities that current policing levels will be maintained in the area concerned and that there will be no diminution of the Garda service being provided to the local community.

Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her father and mother: Section 11D of the 1964 Act (inserted by the Children Act 1997) obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.These legislative provisions, contained in the Guardianship of Children Acts 1964 to 1997, are comprehensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.

There have been 17 appointments made in 2010 to date.Peace Commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The Office of Peace Commissioner is an honorary appointment and Peace Commissioners receive no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services.  An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment.  Nominations are generally received from public representatives.  A local Garda Superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community.  Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation and civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment (i.e. ex-officio).  Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment because appointments are made at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and having regard to the needs of particular areas.

Accordingly, the information available from the Gardaí covers both categories of individuals. The Deputy will appreciate that, of their nature, instances of intimidation of jurors are less likely to come to notice than instances of witness intimidation.The table shows the position with regard to the number of proceedings that have been commenced for offences under Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the period from 2008 to 27 June 2010.YearProceedings2010*152009*28200817*Figures for 2009 and 2010 are provisional.The statutory provisions available to counteract jury intimidation reflect the gravity of the offence.  The Gardaí rigorously enforce these provisions and, of course, will continue to do so.  Further legislative action has being taken in the context of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act  2009, including a significant increase in the penalty following conviction for jury intimidation from up to ten to 15 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	859	I am advised by the Garda authorities that they have a number of strong strategic partnerships in place at national and international level which include, inter alia, partnerships with Europol, Interpol, the Revenue Commissioners (Customs & Excise Branch), the Irish Naval Service, MAOCN (Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre Narcotics), SOCA (Serious Organised Crime Agency) and the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. An Garda Síochána also has a special relationship with its Law Enforcement partners in the PSNI in respect of policing drugs on the island of Ireland.An Garda Síochána continues to be relentless in the pursuit of drug traffickers especially those who target Ireland and Europe and, in cooperation with Revenue Customs and other International Law Enforcement agencies actively assisted by Europol and Interpol, is currently conducting a number of ongoing operations against drug-trafficking.  An Garda Síochána has liaison officers based in The Hague, Paris, Madrid, London, and at Europol, Interpol and MAOC(N) in Lisbon.The targeting of international traffickers is supplemented by a vigorous policy against persons in the Irish state who are supplying controlled drugs.  Drugs and Organised Crime is again being prioritised by An Garda Síochána as a core focus for 2010, through the Commissioner's Policing Plan, 2010, which reflects Government strategies contained in the National Drug Strategy. The links between Organised Crime and the illicit drugs trade are also being actively pursued. The Garda National Drugs Unit, with other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, are targeting persons involved in the illegal drugs trade who are subject of intelligence-led operations aimed at detecting and prosecuting offenders.Revenue's Customs Service has a shared competence with an Garda Síochána in respect of drugs law enforcement. Their relationship is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding, an Operation Protocol and a Joint Task Force arrangement to deal with intelligence-driven operations.I am advised by the Revenue authorities that these arrangements work very effectively and provide for the exchange of intelligence between Revenue and the Garda authorities and for the conduct of joint operations. Furthermore, Revenue participate in the annual programme of Joint Customs Operations which target the highest risk areas in terms of drug smuggling. These operations are conducted under the auspices of the Customs Co-operation Working Party at EU level.Revenue's Customs Service enjoys excellent working relationships with other Customs and Law Enforcement Services abroad. Information and intelligence is exchanged under international conventions and Memoranda of Understanding. Due to the trans-national nature of drug trafficking, the exchange of real-time actionable intelligence is a key component in the law enforcement response and such exchanges have resulted in many significant drug seizures.Revenue has an officer assigned to each of the following: the Europol National Unit,  a Liaison Officer at the Irish Desk in Europol, Den Haag, a liaison officer at the Irish Embassy in London, and a liaison officer at the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre-Narcotics in Lisbon and an officer (on a part time basis) in the Office of the Minister for Drugs. These assignments all form part of Revenue's commitment to the international law enforcement effort to suppress drug trafficking.I am satisfied that a significant impact has been made by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in drug trafficking.  A number of gangs and other organised criminal groupings involved in drug-trafficking into Ireland have also been disrupted and dismantled through the ongoing enforcement policies being implemented by An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service.  Successes by law enforcement agencies have been acknowledged by our international partners and Ireland has shown that it is ready, willing and able to play its part in international drugs law enforcement.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The European Union has made great strides in the field of Freedom, Security and Justice over the past number of years. Justice and Home Affairs Work Programmes and their accompanying Action Plans have played a central role in fostering a more structured and cohesive approach to cooperative and legislative initiatives. The Union has advanced its work, inter alia, in the fight against organised crime and terrorism and the fight against drug trafficking. Ireland welcomed the Stockholm Programme, which was endorsed by the European Council in December last, as the new five-year work programme for the JHA area. This followed a series of discussions between Ministers for Justice and Ministers for the Interior of the Member States over the preceding months.The Stockholm Programme set out the need for a strong, coordinated response to organised crime due to its cross border nature. The very serious issues of trafficking in human beings, child pornography, cybercrime, financial crime, counterfeiting of means of payment and drugs trafficking have all been identified as priorities for action. The all-pervasive nature of organised crime means that actions in these areas need to be tackled in a comprehensive and coordinated manner as the influence of organised crime remains a common factor across the individual areas of concern. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council in June, Ministers agreed Council Conclusions on the Commission's Action Plan to implement the Programme.Also at the June Council, a number of important issues were discussed including internal security, the Pact against International Drug Trafficking and the proposed Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims.The aim of the Pact is disrupting cocaine and heroin routes. It stresses that organised crime gangs involved in drug trafficking operate transnationally and, therefore, a more effective response can be found at the EU level. I share the concerns expressed about drug trafficking and the threat that it poses for community safety in the European Union. Ireland has expressed its support for the Pact and continues to support the practical cooperation measures involved. We have experienced large increases in the consumption of cocaine by all sectors of society. As we all know, the risks associated with cocaine are extremely high and the physical and mental health problems that arise from its use are alarming. I am particularly conscious of the social and economic consequences where the community bears the brunt of the criminal behaviour so often associated with both cocaine and heroin.Ireland is supportive of Member States working together in groups, or working in a regional approach, to combat issues of special interest — as evidenced by our participation in Maritime Analysis Operational Centre (Narcotics) in Lisbon which targets illicit shipments of drugs by sea and air to Europe. Ireland stressed the need to target the assets of organised criminals and cited the recent joint operation between Ireland, Spain and the UK as an example of what can be achieved through cooperation across Member States.There are a number of new threats such as cybercrime and it is crucial that we work together to tackle them. However, more traditional threats should not be ignored. This includes threats from indigenous terrorism. The proposed Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting victims was also discussed. Ireland is actively engaged in prevention, protection and prosecution strategies to deal with this crime. I am supportive of the measures being undertaken in terms of prevention, prosecution and the provision of protection and assistance to victims.

This is a matter that is being dealt with by senior Garda management with a view to identifying specific requirements at Regional and Divisional levels, and drawing up appropriate proposals.Accommodation plans for Garda stations and facilities will be progressed in the context of the Garda Síochána's identified accommodation priorities and in the light of available resources.

However, this can change on a daily basis depending on the number of committals the prisons receive from the courts. This figure does not include prisoners held in special observation/close supervision cells.In addition some prisons/places of detention have dormitory style accommodation. In the case of Castlerea Prison, 55 prisoners are held in a group of domestic scale houses in "The Grove" which is regarded as residential type accommodation.

As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions it is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 429. This represents a 11%  increase in the numbers in custody.The Inspector of Prisons, in his 2008 Annual Report, acknowledged that overcrowding in prisons is an international problem, not just unique to Ireland. To deal with the issue of increasing prisoner numbers the Irish Prison Service — with the full support of Government — has progressed a prisons building programme which has provided close to 1,800 new prison spaces since 1997. This is a significant investment by any standard and our prison investment will continue.Current projects will see in excess 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of the opening of a new completed block in Wheatfield. In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term. Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This accommodation will provide approximately 50 spaces and is due to be completed later this year.The new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development, including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in March of this year and tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus. The detailed appraisal is underway in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Expenditure Guidelines and the new business case is at an advanced stage of preparation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 209 together.The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences, in addressing humanitarian issues and can be an incentive to well-behaved prisoners. It should be noted that a prisoner on temporary release is still subject to his or her sentence and may be returned to prison without any court intervention.Temporary release arrangements are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.As the Deputy is aware periods of temporary release granted can vary greatly from a few hours following a family bereavement to, for example, a requirement to report to the prison every 12 months in the case of a life sentence prisoner who has been released in the community a considerable time ago. I wish to inform the Deputy that on 24th June, 2010 there were 933 prisoners on temporary release. This represents 17.8% of the total number of prisoners in the system on that day. To put this figure in context let me place on the record of the House the equivalent percentage of prisoners on temporary release for the years 1994 to 1997. The percentages are as follows: 1994 — 22.2%; 1995 — 20.2%; 1996 — 17.9% and 1997 — 19.2%.It is not possible to provide exact figures to the Deputy for the occupancy rate of all prison cells for the period requested as this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. However I can inform the Deputy that all prisons have been consistently operating at their full bed capacity/occupancy rate or slightly in excess of it over the last 12 months.The figures provide the bed capacity and persons in custody per prison/institution on 24th June 2010.Prison/Place of DetentionNumbers in CustodyBed CapacityArbour Hill Prison155148Castlerea Prison383351Cloverhill Prison467431Cork Prison303272Dóchas Centre14085Limerick Prison (male)310290Limerick Prison (female)2420Loughan House146150Midlands Prison550516Mountjoy Prison681590Portlaoise Prison270359Shelton Abbey96100St. Patrick’s Institution228217Training Unit113107Wheatfield Prison445430Total4,3114,066

I am advised by the Garda Authorities that it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  Due to the fluid nature of the membership of criminal gangs it is not always possible to ascribe specific crimes to the activities of members of those gangs.An Garda Síochána continue to utilise all available legislative provisions available to them in their pursuit of those involved in criminal gangs.  The additional legislative provisions introduced by the Oireachtas in 2007 and 2009 which amend the Criminal Justice Act 2006 will greatly assist Gardaí in relation to the problem of organised crime and will help them to further develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks through the use of advanced analytical and intelligence methods.  The use of targeted intelligence led operations will facilitate the early intervention of Gardaí and help prevent such crimes.Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crime.  A member of An Garda Síochána must, at all times, have reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been involved in criminal activity before they can arrest and question any person in relation to criminality.There are currently a number of initiatives underway targeting the activities of Organised Crime Groups, the focus of which is to gather evidence on which it is envisaged that charges under the recently enacted legislation may be directed by the Law Officers.  A number of these initiatives are at an advanced stage and investigation files have been submitted to the Law Officers for direction.  In other cases, files are being prepared for submission to the Law Officers.  Also four persons have recently appeared before the Courts charged with offences under the 2009 legislation relating to participation in organised crime activity. As these cases are currently before the Courts, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.

It is too early at this stage of the financial year to predict, with any degree of certainty, the final expenditure in relation to legal aid.

Under the Courts Service Act, 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system to the public, including the provision of statistical and other related information.The operation of the legislation relating to bail is kept under continuing review by my Department, and proposals for amendment of the legislation are brought forward when that is considered necessary.  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.Towards the end of last year, I obtained Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill.  The Bill will restate and consolidate bail law.  In addition, a number of matters to improve the operation of the law are being examined, including where members of criminal gangs are involved.  These include:(a) providing that the courts must have regard to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person or the public posed by the release of the accused person on bail;(b) creating presumptions that bail should be refused for people charged with certain types of serious crime.  In view of restrictions resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights, such presumptions would act as a form of guidance to the courts in identifying those who present unacceptable risks of committing serious offences if granted bail; and(c) extending the powers of the courts to refuse bail where that is necessary to prevent the commission of further offences to include more minor offences which fall below the current level of seriousness required by the Bail Act 1997.I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government later this year.

I am further informed that local Garda management has no recorded complaints of speeding or breaches of road traffic legislation in the area.  Any such incident reported to An Garda Síochána will be investigated.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the local Detective and Drugs Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The deployment of Garda traffic resources is prioritised with the aim of preventing traffic collisions.Community policing is a central feature and core value of the Garda Síochána policing policy.  Current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences, anti-social behaviour and breaches of road traffic legislation, thereby promoting an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.The person concerned initiated Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. The Judicial Review proceedings were struck out meaning that the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Minister stood.The daughter of the person concerned made an application, on her behalf, for permission to remain in the State on the basis of Family Reunification.  This application was refused because the person concerned did not qualify as a dependant under Section 18(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).On the 5 May 2010, an application for Subsidiary Protection was submitted on behalf of the person concerned and this application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

The approval and certification of projects under the Scheme is a matter for the Mid-Shannon Tourism Infrastructure Board in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in consultation with the Minister for Finance.The Mid-Shannon Board and the executive teams within Fáilte Ireland and Shannon Development have extensively promoted the Scheme since its commencement date.  Information seminars have been held with industry groups throughout the targeted region and local authorities have also been engaged to ensure their support for the Scheme and projects that might result from it.I am advised that, to date, a total of two applications from County Galway have been submitted to the Board through Fáilte Ireland for consideration under the Scheme. One application has received first stage approval in principle while, for the other, further information is awaited from the applicant before the Board can proceed to consider approval.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	874	Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  The current round of the Programme has been closed to new applicants since July 2000 and Glenalbyn was included as a location in that programme.While a Preliminary Report was approved for the refurbishment of the existing swimming pool and provision of additional leisure facilities at Glenalbyn in 2001 it is understood that Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council wishes to replace the Glenalbyn project with Loughlinstown.

I have no statutory function in relation to the administration of supports or the award of grants or assistance to tourism enterprises.The National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, has an allocation of funding for Tourism Product Development to stimulate investment in tourism development projects.  However, there are no supports available as part of this capital investment programme for the development of accommodation facilities including hotels, guesthouses etc.As the Deputy may be aware, a tax incentive scheme was previously in place that allowed for a 7-year rate of write off of capital expenditure incurred in the construction/refurbishment of hotel buildings.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	877	Under  the Sports Capital Programme, which is part funded by the National Lottery,  funding is allocated to sporting and to voluntary and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.At the end of 2009 the total level of outstanding commitments on hand from previous rounds of the Sports Capital programme was just over €117m. This represented approximately 1,900 separate allocations. An amount of €48m has been provided in the Department's Estimates for 2010 to meet payments in respect of previously allocated grants under the Programme.Typically grantees are allowed a period of approximately 16-18 months to begin the drawdown of their allocations.  However for a variety of reasons it can take grantees several years to draw down allocations.  Some of the more common reasons for this include: delays in finalising the legalities required to protect the State's investment; delays in the planning process and/or construction; and difficulties in raising the required own funding.The Department has a grant withdrawal programme in place whereby projects where the delay in progressing the project is excessive, or the project has ceased, the Department seeks to withdraw allocations.  While this is a labour intensive and time consuming process an amount of €1.4 million was withdrawn in 2009.The proceeds from the National Lottery form part of the General Exchequer managed by the Department of Finance.No decision has been made on the timing of the next round of the Programme.

Tugann na scéimeanna teanga atá mar chroílár an Achta deis do chomhlachtaí poiblí a gcuid tosaíochtaí a aithint agus a eagrú ó thaobh feabhas a chur ar a gcuid seirbhísí Gaeilge don phobal.  Agus iad ag  ullmhú dréacht-scéime, tá dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú: go bhfuil líon leordhóthanach den fhoireann acu atá inniúil sa Ghaeilge; go bhfreastalaítear ar na riachtanais áirithe Gaeilge a bhaineann le seirbhísí a sholáthar i limistéir Ghaeltachta; agus go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina teanga oibre ina gcuid oifigí sa Ghaeltacht tráth nach déanaí ná cibé dáta a chomhaontófar idir an comhlacht poiblí agus an tAire.Tá 101 scéim teanga céaduaire, a chlúdaíonn 186 comhlacht poiblí ar fad, daingnithe faoi alt 11 den Acht ó a tháinig an tAcht i bhfeidhm i 2003.  Anuas ar sin, tá 30 céad  scéim teanga céaduaire eile, a chlúdaíonn 35 comhlacht poiblí, á n-ullmhú.

Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including directions as to custody and access.  In addition, the section provides that the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for orders on custody and access.  Section 3 of the Act provides that, in deciding on an application relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of a child, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her father and mother: Section 11D of the 1964 Act (inserted by the Children Act 1997) obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.These legislative provisions, contained in the Guardianship of Children Acts 1964 to 1997, are comprehensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.

Illness benefit at half-rate was awarded with effect from 15 December 2009. She was found capable of work by one of the Department's Medical Assessors at a medical assessment on 13 April 2010. A letter issued to her on 19 April 2010 informing her that payment of illness benefit was being suspended with effect from 23 April 2010 and advising her of her right to appeal against this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. She submitted a final certificate from her doctor dated 28 April 2010. The person concerned then submitted another interim medical certificate from a different doctor dated for the same day and for the same medical incapacity. Subsequent interim medical certificates were submitted from the second doctor. A new claim was opened and payment was issued from 4 May 2010 to 26 May 2010 on the basis of the certificates received from the second doctor. When it came to light that payment had been suspended in respect of her initial claim, payment was then suspended in respect of the second claim on the basis that she had recently been found capable of work for the same medical condition. As she was found capable of work on 13 April 2010 she was not entitled to payment for medical certificates submitted subsequently. There is, accordingly, no delay in relation to payment to this person.

There has been a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There has been an increase of a further 46% in the number of appeals received in the first quarter of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.The priority has been to increase personal rates of pension in addition to enhancing the household benefits package which includes TV licence, telephone, electricity/gas and the fuel allowance rather than supplements like the living alone increase.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups.Social welfare changes for 2011, including any changes to the living alone increase, will be considered later this year in the context of next year's Budget preparations, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.

Capital may include the following:  Stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value; Savings certificates/bonds/national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value; Money invested in a bank, building society etc.A financial lump sum paid as a result of an accident would fall into the third category.  While no account is taken of the purpose of the award, including compensation for future medical expenditure, substantial disregards are applied when assessing the weekly means derived from this capital.  In assessing the yearly value of a property or capital, no account is taken of the income, if any, from this capital.  The formula for assessing the means from capital for all social welfare payments (except disability allowance and supplementary welfare allowance) is as follows:CapitalWeekly means assessedFirst €20,000NilNext €10,000€1 per €1,000Next €10,000€2 per €1,000Balance€4 per €1,000The formula for assessing the means from capital for disability allowance is as follows:CapitalWeekly means assessedFirst €50,000NilNext €10,000€1 per €1,000Next €10,000€2 per €1,000Balance (any capital over €70,000)€4 per €1,000The formula for assessing the means from capital for supplementary welfare allowance is as follows:CapitalWeekly means assessedFirst €5,000NilNext €10,000€1 per €1,000Next €25,000€2 per €1,000Balance€4 per €1,000Any changes to the current capital assessment arrangements would fall to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the context of continuing to reduce overall public expenditure and restoring stability to the public finances.

This was the only area of major concern to the Commission.  The policies and practices in relation to promotion and preservation of the Irish language in designated Gaeltacht areas are considered justified and proportionate.  Local authorities were asked to examine their development plans in light of the updated guidance provided in the circular to ensure their compatibility with Articles 43 and 56 of the EC Treaty.  A copy of the Circular Letter is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.Given that the Commission has not yet formally closed the case, I am precluded, on the basis of legal advice, from publishing or disseminating either the correspondence from the European Commission in relation to enquiries or investigations into possible infringements or the State's responses as these documents are regarded as part of possible legal proceedings.  I will, of course, make all documents available once the case is concluded.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	899	My Department has been working with the Golden Eagle Trust on the re-introduction of extinct birds of prey into Ireland, such as the Golden Eagle in Donegal, the White Tailed Eagle in Kerry and the Red Kite in Wicklow.  I am very concerned that there have been recent incidents where some of these re-introduced birds have died as a result of eating poisoned meat-based bait.  Such incidents impact negatively on our commitment to maintain and enhance Ireland's native wildlife, and they also harm our environmental and agricultural reputation at home and abroad.My Department is addressing the regulatory position in relation to the use of poisoned meat-based bait, and it is my intention that new regulations will be made to help enhance protection of our wildlife while, at the same time, ensuring good farming practice. While I recognise that the great majority of landowners and farmers are supportive of the raptor re-introduction project, and against the use of poison, it is necessary to continue to work to stop the few people who are continuing to use poison in this manner.

The Fisheries Boards are already actively engaged in seeking measures to control predator species, where appropriate, as part of their fisheries management.  They work closely with the NPWS in undertaking studies to establish, for example, seal population trends and levels of predation on salmon.  In addition they have commissioned BirdWatch Ireland to undertake a study of predation by the cormorant on fish in selected rivers.  The objective of this study is to determine feeding preferences and carry out an assessment of the impact of cormorant predation on fish stocks.The Loughs Agency has been working with both the NPWS and the Northern Ireland Environment Authority (NIEA) with regard to the possible control of predator seals in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.  They will monitor closely developments in relation to the other above mentioned studies with a view to possibly applying the findings to the Foyle and Carlingford areas.

The Foyle Area (Control of Fishing) Regulations 2010 were made by the Loughs Agency (with approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland through the North South Ministerial Council) under the terms of section 13(1) of the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 and section 13(1) of the Foyle Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1952.This primary and secondary legislation remains extant until either such body makes alternative legislative provision for these purposes.I, as Minister, cannot unilaterally amend the legislation.  There is no provision for derogation within the instrument referred to by the Deputy.

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.In cases of market failure the Government will intervene where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ieIt continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme, which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

Both are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).The HES Scheme, which has a capital budget allocation of €24.3 million this year, provides grant assistance to homeowners for retrofit energy efficiency measures such as attic and wall insulation, very high efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.  In addition, a further €46 million has been allocated to a national retrofit programme, with a substantial portion assigned to the HES Scheme.  Since the HES Scheme launched in March 2009, grants totalling €35 million have been paid to homeowners across the country.  Some 40,000 homes have benefited from 75,000 measures under the scheme to date.  Table 1 details the measures by category.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	906	The Irish bloodstock industry makes a significant contribution to the Irish economy and is particularly important to the rural economy with some 22,000 full-time employees in the thoroughbred equine industry.In 2008, 6,222 Irish thoroughbreds, with a value of €216 million, were exported to 42 countries demonstrating the value of the industry to the national economy. In excess of 40% of the EU output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland. For a small country, Ireland holds a pre-eminent position in the thoroughbred racing and breeding world.The economic value of the racing and breeding sectors was evidenced in a recently published report "Analysis of the economic impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry", commissioned by ITBA, directed by Alan Dukes which found inter alia that:The gross value of the industry to the economy is in excess of €1.1bn per annum.€290m is spent on training fees (of which a significant proportion originates abroad).The number of people involved in horse ownership is 19,036.These figures provide strong justification for the investment by Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) in prize money. Overall prize money is funded from a combination of sources including monies generated by HRI and also monies from sponsors and owners.Government support for the horse racing industry is provided to HRI through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund (the Fund) which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 and is charged with the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.HRI has confirmed to me that prize money on offer in France significantly outstrips that on offer in either England or Ireland and in order to remain attractive and competitive Irish racing must continue to offer prize money that is sufficient to attract the best horses in the world to train and race here.HRI has operated a programme of continuous improvement of facilities at Irish racecourses over the past ten years through it's Racecourse Capital Grant Scheme.  This scheme effectively provided 50% grant aid to racecourses for approved capital projects.  This led for example to the construction of Ireland's first all weather racetrack in Dundalk, the new Killanin Stand in Galway and various other improvements throughout the country such as the enhanced facilities which opened at Ballinrobe just last week.

The application was resubmitted on 18 February 2010, but once again it did not satisfy all of the scheme conditions. The person named was notified on 1 March 2010 of the reasons for the refusal of the application.  He was informed of his right to appeal the decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	910	Against the background of the deterioration in public finances, my approach in preparing the 2009 Estimates for my Department was to protect expenditure for major developmental measures in the agri-food sector. To achieve this objective, savings had to be found in other areas and I decided, reluctantly, to reduce expenditure under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme for 2009 by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares. While overall expenditure on the Scheme has fallen, almost 67,000 farmers have not suffered any reduction in their payments as a result of the introduction of the 34-hectare limit. The rates of payment, which were increased by 8% in 2007, remained unchanged for the 2009 Scheme.Notwithstanding the reduction in funding, the total amount available under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 2009 was €220 million. This represented a substantial injection of funds to underpin incomes for farmers situated in these areas and the Scheme continues to be one of the best-funded Disadvantaged Areas Schemes in the European Union.The rates of aid for the 2010 Scheme have already been set and are as follows:Less Severely Handicapped Lowland and Coastal Areas with Specific Handicap: €82.27 per forage hectare;More Severely Handicapped Lowland: €95.99 per forage hectare;Mountain Type Grazing: €109.71 per forage hectare on first 10 hectares, or part thereof, and €95.99 per hectare on remaining forage hectares.The application period for the 2011 Scheme will open in early 2011 and no decisions have yet been taken at this stage on this Scheme.

A total of €19,737,525 was paid to participants in REPS 3 in Co Donegal in 2009, and €5,388,798 has been paid to date in 2010.A total of €7,960,118 has been paid this year to REPS 4 participants in Co Donegal in respect of the 2009 scheme year. There are now 1,969 applicants for REPS 4 in Co Donegal and it is not possible at this stage to estimate the full level of payments in 2010.  The EU Regulations governing REPS 4 require that payments issue in two instalments, 75% once all administrative checks on all applications, as well as cross-checks against Single Payment Scheme entitlements, have been completed and the balance of 25% once all on-the-spot inspections for the year have taken place.  It is expected that the first REPS 4 payments for 2010 will issue in the Autumn.

Following this announcement my Department published a document detailing the eligibility and other terms and conditions attached to the Scheme.Among the criteria, which were produced in consultation with the farming organisations and ICOS, was the requirement for applicants to satisfy certain educational standards, details of which were also contained in the scheme document.A panel of experts assessed all eligible applications, the results of which I announced on 31st May last. As the person named did not satisfy the educational qualifications, his application was deemed ineligible and was not presented to the panel for assessment. The situation regarding his educational qualifications has not changed in the meantime, therefore I do not see any basis on which to arrange an appeal for this case.

The  application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.1.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	915	The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations including making  arrangements for the marking of examinations.I have been advised by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) that a production error in the Leaving Certificate Accounting Higher Level paper affected a number of schools in south Dublin on Monday, 21 June, 2010. As a result of this error the affected papers were missing their centre section. The incomplete papers, which contained the full Section 1 which is mandatory, was provided to 207 candidates in 16 schools. In total 5,171 candidates were entered for Leaving Certificate Higher Level Accounting examination in 514 schools nationwide.As soon as the SEC learned of this problem arrangements were immediately made to provide the students affected with the correct version of the paper by fax and email. The SEC gave an instruction that students should start the examination using the original paper provided and be given the correct version as soon as it became available in the school. The SEC also advised that additional time should be given in order to make up for any time lost as a result of this error.  The amount of time to be added on at the end of the timetabled session as a consequence of dealing with this specific error in the  Leaving Certificate Accounting paper in individual examination centres would have varied depending on a number of factors such as the time taken to contact the SEC for instructions, the time involved in collecting the incorrect paper  and distributing the correct paper and the number of candidates in the centre.The SEC has also informed me that this issue is being kept under review. The SEC has also apologised to the students and schools affected by this error.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	916	The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has responsibility for the operation of the certificate examinations. As I indicated in my response to the Deputy's  previous question (No. 470) the recent High Court judgment confirms the earlier view of the Circuit Court in October 2007 that the actions of the SEC, and my Department prior to the establishment of the Commission in 2003, in annotating certificates where a core element of a subject is not assessed, is permissible under Irish law and is not discriminatory.The position remains that the ruling and the legal issues relating to it must be examined, and the logistical, ICT and workload issues associated with this year's peak examination period, which is still ongoing, must be considered.The SEC assures me that it is considering the issue as a matter of urgency and proposes to make an announcement regarding the arrangements for issue of the formal Leaving Certificates for the period 2006 to 2009. The announcement will be posted to the SEC website at www.examinations.ie and be the subject of a Press Release.While all candidates received provisional results, their final certificates had been withheld pending the outcome of the legal proceedings. Any candidate who has sought added confirmation of their final results in respect of the period 2006 to 2009 has been furnished with a certified statement of results by the SEC, with the normal fee for such statements, currently €13.50, being waived by the Commission. The Commission sought legal advice following the determination  of the Equality Authority, which was confirmed following the judgment of the Circuit Court, and subsequently implemented this approach.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	920	The project referred to by the Deputy is one of the 33 Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) funded by my Department and operated by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  The VEC referred to by the Deputy operates four STTCs.As part of Budget 2010, with effect from September 2010, STTC provision will be reduced by 300 places nationwide, from 984 places to 684 places. My Department recently advised VECs with regard to the implementation of this reduction and in the VEC referred to by the Deputy, provision will be reduced by 27 places from September 2010.  The implementation of this reduction in individual STTCs is a matter for the VEC.I should point out that the 2006 Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy recommended that STTC provision be reviewed.  My Department then conducted a Value for Money Review of the Youthreach and STTC programmes.The Review was published in 2008 and recommended the phasing out of segregated traveller provision over the medium to long term and the mainstreaming of Traveller specific provision.All further education programmes, both part-time (Adult Literacy, Community Education and the Back to Education Initiative) and full-time (Youthreach, Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme and Post Leaving Certificate) continue  to be open to Travellers.  Indeed, Travellers are accessing these programmes in increasing numbers.My Department is continuing to discuss issues around the phasing out of STTCs and the integration of adult Travellers into mainstream further education provision with the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA), representing  VECs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	921	The inventory on school accommodation is available to schools through the Department's Esinet portal.  Esinet is a platform for interactive communication between my Department and its partners.  It is a secure web-based system which not only allows schools access to the online inventory, but also allows schools access to other facilities such as an online claims system, the September Returns Online Service and the October Returns Online Service.  It is therefore not intended to make this system available to the general public.The inventory will provide key data and statistics on the existing school building stock at both primary and post-primary levels.  As I have previously stated, when the information is compiled and analysed, it is my intention to publish summary information from the inventory in the coming school year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	922	I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 to 265, inclusive, together.The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection and with reference to recent schools' enrolment data.  Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the initial focus of this analysis has been on primary school accommodation requirements.  This will be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary school accommodation requirements.  The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in the short to medium term is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on  significant changes to the demographics of those areas.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these initial identified areas in order to identify school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/15.  School accommodation requirements in the Letterkenny area have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified areas.  When the required reports have been completed for these initial identified areas Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.  School accommodation requirements in the Inishowen, Moville, Buncrana, Carndonagh, Milford and Ramelton areas will be considered as part of this process.Any proposed building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

Donegal projects referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.For the Deputy's convenience, a list of major capital projects for Co. Donegal schools is set out in the following table for ease of reference.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of these project at this time.CountySchool Roll No.School NameCurrent StatusApplication ForProvisional Band RatingDonegal01733BArdara Mixed N S Ardara (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal03294LS N Caiseal Na Gcorr Gort A Choirce (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal04809AScoil An Aingil Choimheadai An Cheididh (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Donegal09009QRockfield Ns, Ballyshannon, (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Donegal11843OS N Neill Mor Killybegs (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 1Donegal12077EScoil Naomh Fiachra Letterkenny (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 1Donegal15770KS N Naomh  Naille Na Caologa (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal16138SRaphoe Central N S Raphoe (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal16608GKillybegs Common N S The Commons (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal16819TS N Gort An Choirce Leitir Ceanainn (Donegal)ApplicationNew SchoolBand 2Donegal16821GClochar Padraig Naofa Carndonagh (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Donegal16836TNaomh Bhrigid NS, Carndonagh (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Donegal16837VS N Duchoraidh Duchoraidh (Donegal)ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Donegal16850NSt Garvan’S N.S.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	924	My Department was not required to develop a sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  For the Deputy's information the six Departments required to develop sectoral plans under this Act were the Departments of Health and Children; Social and Family Affairs; Transport; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Following recent transfers of functions involving a number of Government Departments, including my own, the issue of which Departments carry responsibility for sectoral plans under the Disability Act 2005 is currently being examined in the context of a review of the operation of that Act.  This review is underway and is being co-ordinated by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	925	I wish to inform the deputy that expenditure in 2010 on schools in Donegal will depend on progress of projects and the submission of the necessary certification to my Department in order to enable payment.  Currently, there are three major school building projects at construction stage.  In addition, there are four further major projects in this area in Architectural Planning which were included in the 16th February 2010 announcement of projects to progress in 2010.  All of these projects are currently at an advanced stage of Architectural Planning.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	926	As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates  within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs.  SENOs then carry out assessments of a child's special educational needs, on request by parent or schools subsequent to which they recommend appropriate resources, including special needs assistant provision.While mainstream teaching posts are allocated at the start of a school year and remain for the full school year, the allocation of SNA posts has never been tied to the start of the school year.  This flexibility is designed to assist schools who may not have been able to access relevant professional reports in advance of the start of the school year, or who may have new pupils with special educational needs enrolled during the year.  Similarly, while new SNA posts may be allocated throughout the school year, some SNA's may also leave during the school year where a child may leave or move school, or may achieve a greater level of independence.  As this process is continuous throughout the life of a school year, it is therefore not possible to say how many special needs assistants will be employed by my Department for the 2010/2011 academic year.  There are currently over 10,000 SNA's employed throughout the school system.I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme.  It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.  The SNA scheme will continue to be supported and the NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	927	I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 271 together.The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil  enrolment at 30 September.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The allocation process for 2010/11 school year is well underway.  However, the final staffing position for all schools will not be known until October/November.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.The current number of teaching posts at primary level is 31,860.  The number of teaching posts is expected to increase for the 2010/11 school year due to the projected increase in the number of pupils at primary level and the continued growth in provision for children with special educational needs in schools.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-30 00:00:00	Prelude	928	The gross expenditure allocation for my Department for 2010, as set out in the Further Revised Estimates for 2010, is just over €9.295 billion.  €452 million of this amount is in respect of funding previously funded from the Vote of the Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment.  This is to cover expenditure for the period 1 May 2010, when these functions transferred to my Department, to the end of this year.  The National Training Fund will contribute a further €422 million, additional to the voted Exchequer allocation.The gross current allocation for my Department for 2010 is €8.589 billion, which equates to approximately 15% of total current public expenditure.  My Department's gross capital allocation for 2010 is €706 million.  In addition, €79 million of capital funding was carried over from 2009, bringing the overall total available for capital expenditure in 2010 to €785 million.  This represents an increase of over 2% on the outturn for 2009.This continued significant investment in education and skills, against the very challenging economic backdrop, demonstrates the importance attached by Government to education.  Formulation of the Estimates for 2010 required a number of difficult decisions to taken by the Government.  However, these decisions were guided at all times by the national interest and the need to ensure we can sustain public services into the future.  The Estimates represent an important step on the road to bringing public expenditure into line with available resources.Within my Department's capital allocation for 2010 some €579m has been allocated to the school building programme, reflecting the Government's desire to continue investing in the productive capacity of the economy, to create construction jobs and to provide schoolchildren and teachers with the best educational environment in which to learn and work.  I recently announced an allocation of €122 million for the Summer Works Scheme in 2010 which will see major improvements in 1,490 primary and post primary schools across the country that will benefit from small and medium scale building works this summer.The capital allocation also provides €127 million for investment in higher education.  This will enable my Department to continue the programme of investment in upgrading and modernising undergraduate facilities at institutes of technology, universities and other colleges around the country.  A capital sum of €50 million is being allocated to support the integration of information and communications technology in teaching and learning in schools.  Of the €8.589 billion allocated for gross current expenditure on the Education Vote in 2010 pay and pension costs account for almost €6.4 billion.  The allocation for pay reflects the impact of a saving of over €350 million arising from the cut in public sector pay which came into effect from the start of this year.In line with the commitments agreed in the Renewed Programme for Government additional current funding has been made available in 2010 to protect frontline services in schools.  €12 million is being provided for the employment of 500 additional teachers in first and second level schools over the next 3 years.  €14 million has been provided for additional teachers from September 2010 for the 2010/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio.  These allocations will allow for an increase in teacher numbers of approximately 1,130 between the end of 2009 and the end of 2010.  €19 million is being provided to maintain school capitation grants at current levels and to take account of increased pupil numbers.  This allocation will also enable additional funding to be allocated to schools for school books and to support curricular activities as provided in the Renewed Programme for Government.The current allocation also provides for expenditure of just over €1.1 billion on special needs across the Education Vote. The Estimates also include provision of almost €795 million for measures to tackle educational disadvantage across the sector.  These measures will be directed at those most in need and include a range of services, aimed at: early literacy; improving school attendance and tackling early school leaving; improving access to third-level; and second chance education for young people and adults.  The provision for school transport of €186 million includes provision for new services.The provision for 2010 for Universities and Institutes of Technology is €1,194 million which is a 9% reduction on 2009.  The public service pay reduction accounts for almost 6% of this reduction.  The reduction takes account of targeted reductions in staff numbers employed under an employment control framework for the sector and will also involve further non-pay cost efficiencies.  The overall allocation for funding for student support has increased from €306 million in 2009 to €324 million in 2010 to take account of increased numbers of students.  A reduction of 5% was applied to the rates of student grants and scholarships in 2010, in line with reductions in other income maintenance payments announced in the Budget.A number of savings were identified in relation to the functions which were transferred from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to my Department, mainly in the area of training allowances that are linked to Social Protection payments, and certain FÁS allowances that are provided in addition to the core training allowances.  These savings allow an increase in training and employment places to over 160,000 in 2010. For example, they provide for an increase of 500 in Community Employment places, bringing the total places available to 23,300.The 2010 Budget includes an allocation of €14 million as matching funding for European Globalisation Fund (EGF) initiatives and measures to be directed at enhanced training and employment initiatives for young unemployed, redundant apprentices and former employees of the construction and manufacturing sectors.  Approval from the European Commission has been received for €22.8 million funding under the EGF application to support redundant workers at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick.  Applications in respect of redundancies at Waterford Crystal and SR Technics are currently under consideration at European level.A sum of €20 million is allocated to the new Labour Market Activation Fund.  The Fund is intended to support the provision of training and education programmes for the unemployed — prioritising the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors such as construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35's and the long-term unemployed.  A Call for Proposals was issued in March 2010 for training and education programmes to be funded from the Activation Fund, which I recently announced.

This is being addressed in the context of available resources and published criteria for prioritising school building projects.The provision of GP rooms but not playing pitches is part of the specification for primary schools.  However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow, the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which schools may decide to use for playing fields.  The Department's design guidelines for primary schools include guidance on the provision of general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.  The size of these facilities would be dependent on the size of the new school being built.
