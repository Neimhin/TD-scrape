#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.Total expenditure by my Department from the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal to the end of May 2010 was €39.57 million.  Expenditure in May 2010 was €215,319.The sole member of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Moriarty, has not yet addressed third party costs.  Until this is done, we cannot estimate the overall cost of the tribunal with any accuracy.  The tribunal secretariat has on many occasions over the years told my Department that any attempt by the tribunal to quantify third party costs would lead to conclusions being drawn and suppositions being made which could infringe on the rights of witnesses and impinge on the independence of the tribunal.As Deputies will be aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on tribunals of inquiry, in attempting to establish some estimate of the overall cost of the Moriarty tribunal, gave various ranges for third party costs, but stressed that the figures were subject to many caveats and contingencies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Did the letter agreed by all of the leaders of the parties here in respect of the conclusion of the Moriarty tribunal go to the sole member and has the sole member responded to it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Yes, it was sent, but I have not received a formal reply.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The fees paid to legal teams in the Saville inquiry amounted to just half of what has been paid to the Moriarty tribunal.  In 12 years, the Queen's Counsel and four junior counsel earned a total of €16.1 million, €13 million less than has been paid to the Moriarty legal team to end-April 2010, a bill which is ongoing.  The Taoiseach is aware that it was the tradition that solicitors from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor would be used for the normal practice of tribunals.  The highest salary in that office is €85,000.  This practice was broken in the case of the Moriarty tribunal and a solicitor from private practice was engaged.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that a fee of €1,000 a day has now amounted to in excess of €1.2 million for the past four years in this case?  Is the Taoiseach happy that this practice was the right way to go considering the costs involved?  Fees were set in 2002, seven years ago.  In the context of the current economic climate and the changed circumstances in which we now find ourselves, is it intended that the scale of fees will be reconsidered for the remainder of the Moriarty tribunal?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On previous occasions I have given a response on the rationale for the fees, which are based on the requests the chairman of the tribunal made.  At the time, sanction was given for an agreed fee of €1,000 per day, the same rate paid to solicitors at the Mahon tribunal.  The rate was reduced both last year and this year and now stands at €782 per day.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	On that, in July 2008 the Minister for Finance said that it was decided that legal counsels to the tribunal would no longer be paid once public hearings were completed and the Government told Departments to which the tribunals report that tribunal legal teams, including the €2,700 a day senior counsel, should be let go.  The tribunal has met on only a handful of occasions since last July.  What legal fees have been paid since then? The Irish Times reported that in correspondence with the Department the Minister for Finance said that once public hearings were over, the legal staff associated with the public hearings should no longer be paid.  The Moriarty tribunal has finished its run of public hearings, apart from whatever decision the sole member makes in respect of one other.  In view of the fact that very few hearings were held since last July, does the Taoiseach have the figure in his brief on what has been paid since then?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	6	No, I do not.  As the Deputy knows, a particular work method has been adopted by the chairman of the tribunal in an attempt to keep down costs in terms of how they would play out if the hearings were held in public.  It was on that basis that he devised this particular work method, which has been effective despite the very serious imposition involved in the process going on longer than was originally anticipated based on four separate challenges, all of which were won by the chairman when it came to the hearings.  New rates applied for counsel who arrived after that date.  There was a concern not to put at risk the work being done up to then by existing counsel in terms of not changing those particular rates.  It is the case that some counsel are currently indisposed, so it is a question of working with existing staff and, in an effort to have this completed before the end of this year, to ensure there is adequate staffing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The letter sent to the sole member from the leaders of the parties in the House reflected the fact that the sole member himself had indicated that his work is 80% or 90% concluded in respect of both the money trail element and the licence issue.  I hope the tribunal will be able to report in its entirety in the timescale envisaged by the sole member.  That would be in everybody's interest.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	To clarify, the party leaders agreed on the desirability of the tribunal completing its work as soon as possible consistent with its mandate.  They also agreed to write to the judge to this effect in response to his letter to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The party leaders' letter has issued to the judge and he has written back acknowledging it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Does the Taoiseach have any further information as to when the remaining witness who was to be called to the Moriarty tribunal is likely to appear?  The sole member had decided to hear evidence from Mr. Andersen but there was some dispute as to whether the latter was willing to attend.  I understand lawyers for Mr. Andersen have clarified that he is willing to attend.  That was some months ago.  Is there any information as to when that witness will appear before the tribunal and when thereafter the tribunal is likely to conclude its business?Second, in regard to legal fees, I understand there has been a reduction in the feeds paid to lawyers doing State work.  Has there been a corresponding reduction in the fees paid to tribunal lawyers?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Deputy will appreciate that it is not proper for me to comment on the proceedings or ongoing work of the tribunal.  It is a matter between the tribunal and the witness to whom the Deputy referred as to when that witness will appear.  I understand from when I last spoke to the sole member about this matter that there is ongoing correspondence, but I do not have any more information than I did then.  I do not have any ongoing or daily contact with the tribunal as to how the matter is proceeding.In regard to fees, I can confirm that fees paid to the tribunal's legal team were reduced both last year and this year.  They were reduced by 8% on 1 March 2009 and further reduced by 15% this year, except for one lower level which was reduced by 6.5%.  In other words, the fees to the legal team have been reduced by a total of 21.8%, except for the lower level fee which was reduced by some 14%.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Deputy Kenny asked about the statement made by the Minister for Finance in July 2008 to the effect that legal counsel to the tribunal would no longer be paid once public hearings had ceased.  We had all understood that public hearings had ceased and then information emerged that one further witness was to be heard.  If, to all intents and purposes with the exception of one witness, public hearings have ceased, why are legal counsel still being paid on, it would appear, an ongoing basis?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That was on the basis of having completed all the witnesses for the tribunal.  As Deputy Gilmore indicated, there is at least one outstanding witness that the chairman of the tribunal believes it would be of benefit to hear from.  Therefore, that arrangement would come in place at that point.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Does the Taoiseach recall that in reply to previous questions regarding the barristers fees at the Moriarty tribunal, the Taoiseach refused to identify which barristers would have threatened to walk away if the signalled reductions in their daily attendance rate had been implemented when it was first signalled?  Given that two of the barristers involved have received more than €8.5 million for their work at the tribunal, will the Taoiseach provide a straight answer to the question of whether the barristers threatened to walk away, as he suggested in his own reply to me previously across this floor? If so, why were they not faced down?  Why did we not face them down and ensure that the new rates would have applied?I note the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Kenny earlier to the effect that there was no official reply to the letter from the party leaders in the Dáil Chamber to the sole member.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I corrected that.  There was a reply.  He sent back an acknowledgement.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Is the Taoiseach any better informed with regard to the expected duration of the tribunal?  Is there any projected overall cost to the conclusion of this long and protracted tribunal?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	As I have stated, the independence of the tribunal is an important aspect of this issue.  Therefore, it was important that the ongoing work ongoing was not compromised or put at risk.  The risk of it being interrupted determined the Government's view on these matters regarding the need to keep continuity and the necessity of not being accused of interfering in any way with the tribunal.  Were that to have taken place, there may have been a political charge made that the Government was interfering with the tribunal.  The Government sought to ensure that it was not in any way bringing forward anything which would leave it open to that charge, because that it not our intention.  As other Members have indicated, consistent with the mandate of the tribunal, we wish to see this matter concluded as quickly as possible.  I have indicated that the chairman of the tribunal has suggested he hopes to have it concluded before the end of the year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I refer to my notes of what the Taoiseach stated here previously when I put the matter to him.  The Taoiseach claimed that the recommended reduction in fees for barristers might result in their being driven away from the Moriarty tribunal.  On what basis did the Taoiseach give that answer?  Were there threats to walk away delivered either orally or signalled in any way by any of the counsel attending at the Moriarty tribunal?  If there were, whether overt, hinted in some way or by whatever means of communications, why would the State not have face down such a threat?  It just does not ring true and I am concerned because it runs contrary to everything else the State is apparently about in terms of the payments of fees, salaries, expenses and everything else.  Why would a small cohort of people be immune and, in some way, protected from all of that?  It just does not make sense.  Was some communication or means of expression employed by some of those attending the tribunal that they would walk off the site if the reduced fees undertaken by the Taoiseach's predecessor were implemented?  While the official reply from the sole member does not give the certainty one would like, is the Taoiseach in any better position today to suggest when this tribunal process will end?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I am simply outlining the situation to the Deputy and the review of fees which took place.  Taking account of further communication from the tribunal and its legal team and advice from the Attorney General, it was considered that, in the particular circumstances of the Moriarty tribunal, the fees should remain at what they were at that point.  Since there have been reductions of 21.8% in respect of those fees.  I have no further indication beyond what I have said as to when it will be finalised.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.Progress on implementation of the OECD's Report on Regulatory Reform in Ireland , published in 2001, has been reported on many times in this House, particularly in the context of the follow-up to the Government’s 2004 White Paper on regulation, Regulating Better.  The regulatory reform or better regulation agenda covers a wide range of actions and initiatives and individual Ministers are responsible for reporting on those recommendations relating specifically to their sectors.  The better regulation unit in my Department is tasked with driving better regulation across Government and supports a number of key projects in this regard.In October of last year, the Government published a statement on economic regulation, which provides a framework for the future development of economic regulation in Ireland.  The statement covers issues such as governance and accountability; the appropriateness of regulatory structures and mandates; cost effectiveness and engagement with stakeholders.  It commits relevant Ministers to reviewing the roles and mandates of regulators at least every five years and they will also have to approve planned expenditure by regulators, including industry levies, following consultation with stakeholders.The Minister for Transport will bring forward legislation to merge the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with the National Transport Authority to create a single transport regulator.In line with the commitment in the Government statement to initiate an Annual regulatory forum, I met key regulators, the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, together with the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills and other relevant Ministers at the end of February to discuss the implementation of the Government statement and the contribution that improved competition and regulation across sectors can make to economic recovery and renewal.Arising from these discussions, it was decided that a regulatory liaison group involving senior departmental officials and key regulators would meet regularly to progress key issues.  In this context, relevant Departments are currently working with regulators to  stress test regulatory frameworks to ensure they are sufficiently robust to be able to respond to major shocks and changes in their sectors and in the wider economy.  It is expected the Government will receive a report on these exercises before the end of the year.  The regulatory liaison group is also examining issues relating to regulatory capacity and training and my Department is actively engaging with the academic community in this regard.The better regulation unit also provides support to Departments conducting regulatory impact analysis, RIA, on legislative proposals.  It is an important process that allows Departments to assess the potential costs, benefits and impacts of proposed regulation in a way which is both transparent and accessible to stakeholders.  An independent review of the operation of RIA was published in June 2008.  It acknowledged that good progress had been made in embedding the process since its original introduction but also highlighted some areas where change was needed.  Arising from the review's recommendations, revised RIA guidelines were published last year, which take account, in particular, of the need for improved quantitative analysis and for the increased use of RIA to evaluate draft EU legislative proposals.  Following consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, specific information was also included in the revised guidelines on the measurement of compliance and administrative costs on business.Some 320 officials have undertaken the two day RIA training course to date, with a further course scheduled for September.  The course content was reconfigured in 2009 to take account of the findings of the independent review and is available not only to departmental officials but also to individuals working in independent regulators.  The better regulation unit also delivers shorter RIA modules and an on-line RIA training tool to ensure the maximum possible number of officials are reached.In addition to the work of my own Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is leading a Government project to reduce the administrative burdens on business arising from existing national legislation by 25% by 2012 in line with a similar target at EU level.  A number of simplification workshops have already taken place to allow stakeholders to make suggestions for red tape reductions.  In parallel, the high level group on business regulation is driving efforts in the key areas of taxation, health and safety, environment law, statistical returns, and employment and company law.  The group is chaired by the Secretary General in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, and includes business and union representatives as well as high level officials from relevant Government Departments.  The group last year asked the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to bring together a group of regulatory enforcement bodies to look at the issue of risk-based enforcement and expects to receive a report on this matter later this year.The OECD is currently conducting a review of Ireland's regulatory systems and processes.  The review is being conducted as part of a set of similar reviews covering the original 15 EU member states which is being funded by the EU Commission and covers issues such as regulatory impact analysis, administrative burden reduction and approaches to enforcement.  My Department is co-ordinating the Irish Government input into the review and it is currently expected that the report will be completed later this year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I would need to read the reply three or four times to understand the actual meaning of some of the phraseology given to the Taoiseach.In 2008, the Government said it intended to reduce red tape for business by 25% by 2012.  It is perfectly obvious that many businesses in this country are being strangled by having to allocate serious resources to deal with it, that is, a person spending half a day per week filling forms for the Government and so forth.  The Irish Exporters Association said last March that it had seen little evidence of red tape reduction.  Does the Taoiseach have a response on the progress made on his Government's commitment to reduce red tape for business by 25% by 2012?  What is the position with that at present?  Is there any evidence of it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I answered that question in previous Question Times, when I gave the detail in respect of that question when it was put down for reply.  The brief I have with me today deals more with the regulatory arrangements.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	More than a year ago the Tánaiste said that Government Departments were identifying what were called "information obligations" dealing with the requirements of regulatory reform, with particular reference to areas that were causing the biggest burden for business.  She said this included all areas of regulation, including taxation, health and safety, statistics and employment and company law.  She went on to say that work was well advanced in measuring obligations in company law, employment and health and safety law.  She said that simplification plans would follow on foot of this important work.An employer told me a few days ago that he was charged €150 when somebody called from the Health and Safety Authority to explain to one of his workers how to get down from a dumper.  The worker had been driving dumpers for 20 years.  While these matters are important, it appears that the simplification plans are not yet in place.  What is the status of the simplification plans commitment given by the Tánaiste?  Have these plans been designed or will they be published?  Does the Government intend to introduce a standard cost model to assess properly the impact of regulation on small business?  This is important for the retention of employees and the potential to recruit new employees.  What is the status of the simplification plans mentioned by the Tánaiste in respect of company, employment and health and safety law, and is it intended to introduce a standard model for the regulation of small business?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As I said in my reply, detailed questions in respect of specific departmental work need to be put to the Department concerned.  Total savings of €20 million have been identified in a number of individual administrative burdens which were measured.  The high level group is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and business and trade union representatives are members of the group, which is due to report before the end of the year on the ongoing work.  This will indicate what further steps can be taken.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Is it intended that the high level group will make any specific recommendations about reducing the amount of red tape that business has to deal with and about simplifying the regulatory regime that now applies to many areas of life?  With regard to his Department's unit dealing with better regulation, my understanding is that this was conducting some kind of review of all of the regulatory systems and that a report would issue later in the year.  When is that report expected?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	As a result of a meeting with the regulators and the Competition Authority, a liaison group is in place to examine all these aspects.  Arrangements exist under the regulations to review individual regulatory procedures in the various sectors once every five years.  In the meantime, the liaison group is looking at that issue as well.The better regulation unit in the Department of the Taoiseach exists to facilitate ensuring there is sufficient training and sufficient initiatives in place to enable the people in the service to take on board the requirements that are now set out, for example, in developing proper regulatory impact analyses in respect of legislative decisions and ensuring proper analysis is undertaken by people competent in this area.  More than 320 individual public servants from across Departments have been involved in that process as part of training people to do this work sufficiently well.As the Deputy notes, a group including business and trade union representatives deals with the wider EU project of identifying and reducing administrative burdens on business by 25% over the course of the period involved.  This work is ongoing and is on track, I understand.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	It has been ongoing for a long time.  The former Minister with responsibility for enterprise, the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, launched a programme back in 2000 which she said would alleviate the significant burden of administrative requirements on small businesses, yet we still hear of cases where some of the requirements on business are absolutely ludicrous.  For example, ISME recently referred to a company which was transporting a wide load from Limerick to Dublin and needed to get separate transport licence from six different local authorities along the route, each local authority charging €250 a time for the separate licence.  I refer to examples of local shopkeepers being inspected repeatedly for what appear to be relatively minor matters.  We hear constant reports about the endless amount of form-filling and information supply that is required of business, none of which seems to add to better regulation.  It is a case of regulation by quantity rather than by quality.For a decade there has been talk of reducing this burden, yet we still seem to be in a position where all this red tape has to be complied with.  Government committees and high level groups are looking at the amount of red tape to be dealt with and will then report on it on an ongoing basis, but no effective measures appear to have been taken to simplify the existing regulatory systems.  The issue to be addressed is when we will see not just reports from high-level groups, monitoring groups and individual Departments but commonsense rationalisation and streamlining of the regulatory regime.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I contend that is being done.  Some €20 million worth of measures have been identified and are in place.  This initiative began as a result of the Spring Council meeting at EU level a few years ago.  The EU 15 are being monitored in that respect and have those arrangements in place.  We are proceeding along the lines and doing the work as envisaged.  Individual issues will be raised and where each local authority sees the wide-bodied vehicle passing through, it saw an opportunity to claim a fee.  Clearly, there should be one overall fee but then the question arises as to who should get it.  Individual examples can be cited where it would have been better to deal with that comprehensively as a single trip from A to B.  Perhaps the host licensing authority would be the beneficiary of that.  There are always opportunities for better arrangements.  By the same token, situations arise where there are problems related to health and safety or other issues.  Deputies in this House would be the first to stand up and ask whether people are in compliance with the regulatory arrangements.  We need to see perceived proportionality and consistency in respect of regulation.  A commonsense approach is required and it is important those tasked with compliance and enforcement functions, which are statutory obligations that cannot be ignored, apply common sense and give people an opportunity to put their houses in order where they deem there is a willing partner on the other side in the employer community, prepared to work with the authority to rectify a safety issue or an issue concerning consumer goods.  It is important that a balance is struck and one needs people with good judgment to initiate and enforce the arrangements.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Government White Paper on regulatory reform has a list of actions relating to the legislative process.  One calls for provision of better, improved information on new legislation and commits to ensuring Departments and Government offices will provide Deputies with an improved information flow in respect of promised and pending legislation and, specifically, the publication of the heads of a Bill where feasible or appropriate.  I have asked this question of the Taoiseach a number of times.  Has progress been made?  From my position, it does not appear to be the case.  I cannot recall the last time I was circulated with the heads of a Bill.  I am the spokesperson on health and children yet I cannot remember the last time the Department of Health and Children and the Minister, Deputy Harney, provided the heads of the Bill even though a number of items of legislation from that Department are going through the Houses.  The commitment is there.  What is the view of the Taoiseach on improvements to be made to live up to that promise?  A number of items of legislation are promised for 2010.  Does the Taoiseach know if the heads of any of these Bills will be published during the summer recess in order that Deputies have an idea of what will be addressed by them on the resumption of sittings after the recess?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I do not have that information but I will check the points raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin regarding the extent of improvement made in this area and to what the recommendations refer.  I revert to the Deputy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to do that.  Does the Taoiseach agree it would be a worthwhile exercise to examine each Department with regard to this commitment in the White Paper?  Does he acknowledge that this commitment has been made over a number of years by his predecessor and during his own time in office?  However, there is no evidence that there has been any improvement, certainly in the portfolios to which I am exposed.  It would be a worthwhile exercise to demonstrate to each Department, particularly those that are failing completely to live up to the Government's commitment in that White Paper on regulatory reform.  It is to be hoped that a new application of the previously-stated intent will apply from the autumn.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to inform Members how detailed an examination of this issue he is prepared to undertake?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As I stated, I will revert to the Deputy as to what is the position in respect of the recommendations to which he refers.  I do not have the information to hand.  The purpose of Question Time is to give the Deputy such information and I undertake to get it to ascertain where we stand on it.  As the Deputy is aware, there are occasions on which legislation is brought forward quickly.  Some of the arguments about this are that it is not brought forward quickly enough and detailed legislation is sought all the time by Members.  However, I will check into the matter and will revert to the Deputy.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I seek clarity in respect of regulatory impact assessments, RIAs.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is quite extraordinary that regulatory impact assessments are never published by Departments?  When European Union directives are being introduced, the Secretary General of each Department has all the evaluations of the impact of such regulations but they never are discussed in this House.  Second, I refer to the new Europe 2020 job strategy, which is about the European Small Business Act that has been initiated by the European Commission.  In light of the impact on jobs and the backbone of the economy, can the Taoiseach clarify that in future, the RIAs for all directives and their interpretation and transposition into Irish law, especially on business with less regulation and bureaucracy, as well as investment in research and development, should be debated within the Parliament?  This should be done to get a clear evaluation of such RIAs because it is too late after they have been transposed into Irish law.

They come before the Government and are subject to that wider confidentiality rule.  However, as for being able to explain the basis for legislation and the reason a particular range of steps or initiatives have been taken, debates on legislation, whether on Second, Committee or Report Stage, offer an opportunity for people to glean from the Minister what is the background to the assessment.Moreover, many Departments publish RIAs and relevant legislation on their websites.  There are many issues that must be considered when assessing the best way to manage the publication of legislation and RIAs on departmental websites.  These issues include accuracy, consistency across Departments and other technical issues.  The Government works closely with stakeholders, including the RIA network, as to the best approach to implementing the recommendation.  New RIA guidelines give specific details of where to publish revelatory impact assessments on departmental websites.  It was agreed that if a Department's website already has a legislation page, then the RIA should be published next to the relevant item of legislation on that page.  If no such page exists, the RIAs must be published on a dedicated RIA page, together with a link to the legislation to which they relate.  This has been the practice recently.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	35	One issue with which I am familiar on foot of my experience as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny pertains to the transposition of European Union laws.  I refer to the major impact of the matter that is of greatest concern at present, which is that RIAs that would not breach Cabinet confidentiality are not being circulated.  Consequently, the transposition of such directives may pose massive difficulties for small companies with unnecessary red tape and the elimination of possible research and development funding.  I believe that a unique opportunity is being missed whereby many of the difficulties that emanate from Europe could be discussed in this Chamber long before they are transposed into law.Will the Taoiseach make reference to the Small Business Act, in light of the publication by the European Commission of Europe 2020, which is a major document on jobs?  The Commission has a huge initiative in respect of the Small Business Act.  What is the Government doing in respect of its implementation in Ireland and the support for small companies?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The 2020 strategy has been adopted at the previous European Council meeting.  There will be a detailed legislative response at European and other levels regarding that.  I accept Deputy Perry's point that there is an increasing body of legislation and directives that require scrutiny.  Under the Lisbon treaty we now have a greater degree of involvement by national parliaments.  In the past it was the case that directives were already adopted and it was a question of trying to work out the impact thereafter.  A major amount of work is put on the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny by the Lisbon treaty provisions .  I accept it is important that in respect of important areas of legislation we deal with them in as timely a fashion as possible.  Much of the legislation and regulations are not contentious or germane to the central economic or social issues.  It is incumbent on committees and Departments to liaise with the European Commission Directorates to try to ensure that work that is in preparation that has the potential impact to which the Deputy referred would be considered and that where an input is required by both Parliament and Departments we should arrange for that to be done.  The point is well made.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 30 together.The current Irish passport system is one of the most secure in the world.  The taxpayer has made a significant investment in enhancing the security of passports.  The passport has been designed to ensure that the technologies used are those strictly controlled and mandated by the relevant international body, ICAO, International Civil Aviation Organisation, in Montreal.  Officers of the passport service meet regularly with other similar jurisdictions and ICAO to ensure that Irish passport meet international security demands and best practice.While the fake Irish passports used by those suspected of involvement in the Dubai assassination were of a type produced before the introduction of the current APS passport in 2005, it must be emphasised that these passports conformed fully to the highest international standards in place at that time.  The passport was further enhanced in 2006 with the addition of a biometric chip, the Irish e-passport.As forgery techniques advance, through the availability of more sophisticated production equipment, it is essential that the security of Irish passports are kept under constant review.  It is in this context I announced last week that I have requested the passport service to initiate an ongoing review of passport technology to ensure that the Irish passport continues to be a trusted and secure travel document.  The review will include consultations with the ICAO secretariat.In regard to the issue of the alleged use of counterfeit Irish passports on Sunday 27 June, United States federal agents arrested a number of people for allegedly carrying out long-term, deep-cover assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.  The individuals were subsequently charged with conspiring to act as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation within the United States and, in the case of some of the individuals, additional charges related to money laundering.  The affidavit lodged by the FBI alleges that one of the defendants had travelled to Moscow using a false Irish passport.Upon hearing of this allegation, I immediately asked the passport service to investigate the matter and to work in close co-operation with An Garda Síochána.  Investigations are under way.  They are at a very preliminary stage and, therefore, I am not in a position to provide more detail today.At this time, what we are confronted with is an allegation in a US court that an individual had travelled from Rome to Moscow on a false Irish passport.  Our own investigating officers are working to establish the veracity of this allegation and the nature of the evidence to substantiate it.  Accordingly, it is premature to reach any conclusions or make representations to other Governments at this time.I wish to see the current investigations concluded at the earliest opportunity.  However, I am conscious that there is a legal process under way in the United States.  I am sure Deputies would share with me the necessity not to comment or act in any way that might influence the outcome of these proceedings.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We all know what the started the passport affair, namely, the incident in Dubai last February.  The Minister said this incident related to one of the pre-2005 passports.  I presume the passport to which he referred is the one with the plastic-covered picture.  Has he any idea what passport was used by the individual on the trip to Russia?  What type of passport was used by the one and only Richard Murphy in that case?  It is important to find out whether the automatic passport system was used.The Minister stated the new e-passport is quite secure.  Thirty-three thousand passports were stolen, mislaid or lost in Ireland last year.  This represents approximately 6% of the passports issued in 2009.  Is the Minister happy that the e-passport is secure and that Irish citizens feel safe using it?  That is an important question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The investigation is at a very early stage and it is important that we get the full facts thereon as early as possible.  I am loth to comment specifically on the details on the assertion that has been made.The Deputy asked whether the current passport technology is safe.  It is top class and to a very high specification.The Deputy is correct about the Dubai incident in that the passports concerned were pre-2005 passports.  Perhaps some of the passports in the current case are pre-2005 passports but, to be sure, we must await the emergence of specific details.The Deputy's point on the number of passports lost is a separate issue.  We must acknowledge that, in the modern era, there are people, or agents, who have very significant capacity, despite the most recent technological advances, to continue to attempt to forge and steal identities.  Technology experts would advance this point.  That said, such offences have not occurred to date in respect of the post-2005 passport to my knowledge.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	40	There are a few questions that need to be answered.  The pre-2005 passport had the same name and details as the original passport but a different serial number.  How come this was not picked up by the authorities in the countries in question?I am disappointed the Minister said he will not publish the report on the Israeli passport affair, or that he has not published it yet.  He promised Deputy Timmins last May that he would publish it as soon as possible.  A report was produced by the Garda and the Irish Passport Office.  Have they recommended that the report be published?  It is important.  We know of eight or nine fake passports and do not know how many more there are.  Is Ireland a soft touch in terms of superpowers faking passports?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We said we would provide a redacted version for the Deputies concerned.  Members opposite, with the exception of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, were preoccupied over the past fortnight.  I will revert to Deputy Pat Breen.We must be careful about our remarks because no issue arises in respect of millions of Irish passports.  There are approximately 2 million valid passports of the pre-2005 type held by Irish citizens on this island and around the world.  We do not have correspondence details for every one of these people and must be practical.  The Deputy may rest assured that from 2005 the investment in this area was very significant.  On foot of advanced technological input, we have a very good high-quality passport.  Understandably, the Irish passport is held in very high regard internationally and is not a soft touch.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is an ongoing review.  I hope it will be ready in a matter of months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Irish United Nations Association, IUNA, is a non-governmental organisation based in Dublin whose objectives are to promote the aims and activities of the United Nations and its specialised agencies in Ireland.IUNA received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs to achieve these objectives from 1972 onwards, with €60,000 allocated for this purpose in 2009.  In addition to providing this funding, my Department has provided support to IUNA in terms of advice on strategy and internal governance procedures.  In the period 2007 to 2008, my Department, in co-operation with IUNA, conducted two extensive reports on the association.  A series of recommendations were produced identifying reforms geared to better enabling IUNA to fulfil its mandate.Following a review of departmental expenditure in 2009, and taking into account the recommendations of the McCarthy report that in the current very difficult budgetary circumstances funding for IUNA should cease, no allocation for grant-in-aid to IUNA was made for 2010.  Furthermore, there is no proposal to resume funding to IUNA in future years.  This position has been communicated to IUNA by my Department and the association is proceeding on this basis.While this is a matter for IUNA, the immediate priority for the association should be reform of its structures and procedures, in line with the recommendations set out in the review and audit of the association undertaken on behalf of the Department in 2007 and 2008.  I encourage the association to seek to engage with private donors following on from implementation of the necessary structural and procedural reforms recommended in these reports, including efforts to expand its membership base.Promoting public understanding and knowledge of the United Nations is a goal that the Government, through its long-standing support for and commitment to the United Nations, actively pursues on an ongoing basis through its national and international policies.  Our strong support for the promotion and protection of human rights, our long tradition of participating in UN-mandated peace operations, our leading role internationally in disarmament and non-proliferation issues and the work of Irish Aid in alleviating poverty and combating global hunger all provide good examples of how the Government demonstrates its commitment to the UN and, in turn, helps to promote awareness of the UN's indispensable role in addressing issues of global concern.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.  The Irish United Nations Association has as its patron the President of Ireland.  It is also a member of the World Federation of United Nations Associations.  During its history, it ran into difficulties and was reformed, thus breathing new life into it.  I raised this at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs because it was singular in that the line for the association was lost.  If one wanted to implement the 2007-08 report, which has my support, provision should have been made for a small sum to allow for the consideration of a new structure for the organisation.  I am not asking the Minister whether he agrees with my next comment, but this situation relates to the crudeness of the McCarthy suggestions, particularly those on foreign affairs.  The Minister's predecessor was on the review group advising Kofi Annan on reform of the UN.  A unique opportunity exists through the transition year classes that Oireachtas Members visit.It would have been ideal had we at least left some seed money so that it could be reformed.  On 1 January 2010, all funding ceased.  A telephone call to the office when the telephone had been cut off and the website had been closed down to ask what the office's current activities are would not be helpful.  Will the Minister consider setting aside a nominal sum while the review takes place so that we could all co-operate on setting up a mechanism?  That the Irish United Nations Association, IUNA, under the patronage of the President, would be abolished from the Estimates in one stroke on foot of the McCarthy suggestion seems inconceivable.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Please, allow the Minister to reply.  I will call the Deputy again.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Sometimes, we need to make calls on these issues.  Subheads and budget allocations cannot be continued forever on the basis that everyone is nice.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	54	That is not what I am asking for.  If I remember correctly, a good programme was put in place in this respect after the association held an AGM back when Muireann Ní Briain headed it.  It was active.  Had the Department's UN desk been unhappy with the association, it should have told the Minister that IUNA was not performing well and he could have addressed the matter through the Estimates.  Let us remember the history of the situation.  The amount of money involved was more than €60,000 at one stage.  Making it €200,000 was considered, but the amount fell to €60,000, then to €10,000 and finally it was cut.With the greatest respect, the IUNA, as part of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, WFUNA, and under the patronage of the President, is an important connection with schools.  At the very least, the Minister should put a small sum of money in place to allow every Deputy to make suggestions on how the IUNA could become more active.  I am not asking for much.  With the greatest respect and while the Minister might restrain himself, I know more about foreign affairs and educating people on the subject than Colm McCarthy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I have given the outline and the reasons for taking this decision.  In terms of the objectives that the association set for itself, we cannot keep slotting money into various subheads year on year.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	57	It is the underlying rationale.  However, we encourage support for UN objectives, particularly in terms of increasing awareness in Ireland of the UN's work.  I am available to receive any proposal that comes my way and I will discuss the Deputy's points with my people.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I will make a proposal.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	59	On 2 July, 59,452 applications were in the system, representing a reduction of more than 8,500 applications in the backlog since the middle of June.  I am conscious that the level of passport applications in the system remains excessively high.  However, one contributory factor is the exceptional demand for passports this year.  To date, passport demand is running at 13.8% higher than this time in 2009.Passport service staff continue to work overtime to assist in keeping the number of applications in the system to a minimum.  Recently, 50 additional temporary staff commenced work in the service and are working with permanent staff members to clear the backlog.  These measures alone have allowed for more than 68,000 additional passport applications to be examined over and above those considered during normal hours.  I am also prepared to recruit additional temporary staff if necessary.I fully accept that the current service is less than satisfactory and is not of the standard that the public has been used to and is entitled to expect.  However, the effects of the prolonged period of industrial action and the increased demand have made it difficult to return immediately to the excellent service normally offered by the passport service.  However progress is being made.  The service has re-introduced a guaranteed turnaround time for passport applications.  Applications submitted via the passport express service — Swiftpost in the Republic and NIPX in the North — available through local post offices are now guaranteed to be processed within 20 working days.  This guarantee will be kept under review and it is intended that time required will reduce over the coming weeks.  The new guarantee turnaround time will help re-establish trust in the operation of the service.A new service to prioritise applications for those with immediate travel plans has also been introduced.  Applications with proof of travel are guaranteed to be processed within three working days.  Applicants should make contact with the passport service and provide this proof where applicable.  An additional fee may apply in respect of such new and urgent applications, as was the case before the dispute.  This is the fastest turnaround time for all applications except for those whose travel is required for urgent humanitarian reasons.  While clearing the backlog will take some time, every effort is being made to minimise the inconvenience to the travelling public.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Minister mentioned an increase of 13.8% in the number of passport applications being processed this year.  However, it is highly unlikely that the increase is due to people going on holiday.  Rather, it is down to people emigrating because Government policies have left them with no hope.I have a number of concerns.  For example, that it still takes 15-20 working days to process a passport application is not good enough.  I welcome the important agreement between the Government and the public service, as the situation was frustrating for those seeking passports.  We all remember the queues earlier this year.  As someone who attends the Passport Office on a weekly basis, that applicants must still spend hours queuing is frustrating.  It is also frustrating for the staff.  Every time I have been in the office, I have seen an argument because of people's frustrations.  This problem must be eliminated.What options is the Minister considering to speed up the process?  Doing so would be important.  Has the Minister taken on temporary seasonal staff and how many are there?  We are in the height of the season for people seeking passports.In a parliamentary question some time ago, I asked the Minister whether he had progressed his proposal to establish an additional passport office outside Dublin.  Speaking as someone who deals with the offices in Cork and Dublin, the former seems to be running more efficiently.  I do not know whether this is because the Minister is from Cork.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	It is down to DNA.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Deputy is entitled to one minute for a supplementary question, but he has had two and a half minutes.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	68	My supplementary question will be on the additional staff.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Many of the Deputy's questions were answered by my original reply.  We have recruited the additional 50 staff.  The passport service receives approximately 2,900 applications per day.  However, I stated that passport demand is running at 13.8% higher than it was at this time in 2009.  The main reason for this is the publicity around the delay owing to industrial action.  Many people decided to get their applications in for fear of the length of time the process would take.  That is the logic.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	70	They see no hope.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	71	In view of the backlogs being dealt with, I expect things to return to more normal patterns in due course.  The advent of overtime and the recruitment of additional temporary staff has had a positive impact because the number of passports being issued per day now is in the region of 3,200, which is considerable.The Deputy made reference to people queuing up and so on.  We are saying, unequivocally, that the recommended method for submitting passport applications is via the passport express service, or the Northern Ireland passport express service, available through the local post office.  We would recommend to people generally that this is the best and optimum methodology.  Public counter or the wire services should only be used by those who have a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency.  All other applications should be submitted via passport express channels.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I have two brief questions.  What progression has the Minister made in regard to the provision of an additional passport office?  Being parochial, I should like to see a passport office being set up in the mid-west region, building on the success of the Cork passport office, particularly given the fact that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food office in Ennis is closed, and staff have not been reassigned to other duties.  The Government owns the building in Ennis, so perhaps I can lobby the Minister in that regard this afternoon, given the success of the Cork initiative.When does the Minister expect the passport processing service for Oireachtas Members to resume, whereby they could leave passports here in the Dáil and they would be collected the following week?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	73	In terms of the extension of the service this is subject to capital funding, and funding generally but I indicated on the last occasion that priority would be given to the north west because of the Northern Ireland demand and so on.  I do not envisage anything beyond that in the medium term.  Prior to the difficulties we have had, the passport service was working very well, the turnaround time was exceptionally good and customers were well served.  I am confident we shall return to that.In terms of the facility that was available for Members of the Oireachtas, as soon as things return to a more normal pattern I envisage that service returning as well.  Members have been accommodated as much as humanly possible in emergency cases that they have brought to the attention of the passport office.  As I said in my original reply, the prioritisation of those who have immediate emergencies will be accommodated within a three-day period.  That again will meet many of the concerns and issues that Deputies have.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Can I ask a few questions, as regards Question No. 30?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Yes.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Minister in his reply to Question No. 27 said how serious the fraudulent use of an Irish passport was.  It is a very serious matter and it came to light last February and again recently with the name of the famous Richard Murphy.  In light of the previous case in Dubai, the Minister called in the Israeli Ambassador for questioning, as regards what happened there, as he was justified in doing.  The Minister spoke with Foreign Minister Lieberman at one of the Council Meetings in Brussels in regard to this.Now there is another serious situation, where an Irish passport was issued in the name of a Donegal citizen and picked up in Rome which was allegedly used by Russian spies.  Has the Minister made any contact with the Russian ambassador here in Dublin in relation to this incident, and if not, does he propose to do so?  Will he say whether the Irish ambassador in Russia has made similar contacts with his counterparts there as well?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Garda and the passport service are investigating the allegations that were raised in a US court.  What we have is an allegation and we have to establish the veracity of that assertion.  We are not at that stage yet.  We have not had access to much of the material because obviously it may be used in the court case.  This will involve liaising with the US authorities, and following up with any citizen whose passport details might have been misused.  Again, we shall look at the travel histories of any such persons and I shall report to the House when these investigations have been completed.I will come back to the House in regard to those matters.  My position in regard to the fraudulent use of Irish passports is well known, and has been articulated on the floor of this House.  The Deputy can take it that we take any misuse of an Irish passport very seriously, indeed, and will act appropriately.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The fact is an Irish passport was allegedly used in a given situation, and this has more or less been confirmed by the authorities.  I ask the Minister to talk to his Russian counterpart because Ireland does not want to be seen as a soft tough on the international scene.  Here we have Israel and Russia, two so-called superpowers allegedly using Irish passports for fraudulent purposes.  That is a very serious situation, as the Minister has acknowledged.  The fact that these passports were used puts the safety of Irish citizens at risk.  How come it was not a case of passports from any of the Eastern Bloc countries, but rather Ireland?  I ask the Minister to call in and talk to the Russian ambassador about the situation.  I understand he has to find out the facts, but he must emphasise to the Russian ambassador how serious is the situation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	82	In terms of the flow of information, in the Dubai case when our ambassador went to the Dubai authorities, significant details were provided in terms of numbers and so on.  Before one sees anybody one needs to establish the veracity of the assertion being made.  We must also be mindful that in the US jurisdiction, as we speak, a court case is ongoing, and we have to be very careful.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Why cannot the Minister act in regard to the Russian Foreign Minister?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Equally, there is a report that a British passport was used but I do not know whether that is the case.Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 27.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The European Council at its meeting in June adopted the European strategy for jobs and growth, Europe 2020.  This includes EU headline targets in the five areas of employment, research and development, climate change, education and social inclusion.  The targets represent shared objectives covering the action of the member States and the Union. Some, notably those on greenhouse gas emissions, have a basis in EU legislation.  The majority are not binding in the regulatory sense, but they constitute a common aim and the combination of monitoring, reporting, scoreboards and peer pressure should contribute to their realisation.The focus has now shifted to the work which must be undertaken, at both national and EU level, to ensure the strategy is successfully implemented.  Essentially this means translating all EU headline targets into national targets.  Member states, including Ireland, must now work over the coming months to agree national targets and identify potential bottlenecksI might mention here that we have already exceeded the target of 40% of 30 to 40 year-olds having completed tertiary or equivalent levels of education and our school drop-out rate at 11.3% is close to the set target of 10%.A series of bilateral dialogues organised by the Presidency and the Commission with each member state has taken place to discuss with member states how they intend to translate these targets and identify national specificities.  These meetings enabled member states to point to specific national situations influencing the national target-setting.  This work is expected to be completed by member states in their national reform programmes this autumn which will see the strategy's translation into definitive commitments and national targets.   Throughout this process, a co-operative approach will be taken between the Commission and the member states to ensure the targets which are set are both attainable and take into account the particular circumstances of each member state.Both the European Council and the European Commission will play an important role in monitoring the implementation of the strategy.  Effective monitoring of the strategy will be key to its successful implementation.  The European Commission will monitor annually the situation on the basis of a set of indicators which will be developed to show overall progress towards the objective of a smart, green and inclusive economy delivering high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIt will issue a yearly report on the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy focusing on progress towards meeting the agreed headline targets and assess country reports and stability and convergence programmes.  As part of this process, the Commission will present policy recommendations or warnings, make policy proposals to attain the objectives of the strategy and will present a specific assessment of progress achieved within the euro-area.The European Council will once a year assess the progress made at EU and national level towards the implementation of the strategy.  The Council will also regularly debate economic developments and the main priorities of the strategy.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	86	It is widely acknowledged that the Lisbon strategy, predecessor to Europe 2020, was a disaster in that its targets were not met with no mechanism in place to bring into line those member states which failed to achieve them.  The Minister referred to the targets set by Europe 2020, such as an employment rate of 75% which is very ambitious.  The target of 3% of GDP for investment in research and development is the same as the one set ten years ago which was not met then.  It is difficult to identity what can give us confidence that this 3% target will be met by the Europe 2020 strategy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	87	May we have a brief question please, Deputy.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The monitoring of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy through the open method of co-ordination was loose.  There was no clear way of disciplining or responding to those member states which did not achieve their targets.  Will this be different with the Europe 2020 policy?  Does the Minister believe the implementation of a fines system is the way to deal with this, particularly considering the already enormous budgetary deficits in most member states?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I would not favour financial fines for member states which do not reach their Europe 2020 targets.  A different situation, however, pertains to financial governance and membership of the euro.  I accept there is a need for measures to ensure compliance in this regard.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	90	That is merely aspirational.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The difference between the Europe 2020 and the Lisbon strategies is that the former is more sharply focussed with its narrowing down to five key objectives, namely employment, research and development, climate change, education and social inclusion.  Not all of the Lisbon strategy was poor but much of it depended on the adherence to it by member states.The fact that Ireland has a 46% participation level in tertiary education means that we took certain issues seriously.  We worked to enhance our educational performance and achieved such a participation rate through significant investment in third level capacity over the past ten years.  One does not get the extra numbers into third level if more places, seats, lecturers and education personnel are not provided.Deputy Creighton is correct that many member states did not reach 3% of GDP on research and development.  Ireland did transform its research and development landscape in the past decade so that it now stands at 1.5% of GDP.  In 1997 when I became education Minister the departmental budget for research was nil with no programme for research in third-level institutions, PRTLI, or Science Foundation Ireland.  While significant changes have occurred in this area, we must also focus in outcomes and intensity levels in research.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I have no doubt as to the achievements of the Minister when he was in the Department of Education and Skills.  However, my question was referring to the whole of the European Union, not simply the Irish level of progress.There is a concern that the Stability and Growth Pact has not been brought into the Europe 2020 strategy, meaning both still operate as parallel systems.  Will the Minister agree it might be useful and logical if they were integrated so as to ensure they achieve a greater degree of competitiveness and economic growth but do not diverge on different policy paths?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I understand and see the merit in the Deputy's argument about integration but I am not sure one could achieve a Europe 2020 strategy if one followed that course of action.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	94	That is a neoliberal contradiction.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	95	No, the point is that one cannot divorce the obligations of member states under the Stability and Growth Pact and Europe 2020.  The strategy tells member states the core areas of economic development on which they should be focussing as a priority.  Member states do not want Europe telling them how to develop every single policy area in, say, health or education.  Historically, the control of those two areas has been guarded for national parliaments and executives.I support the idea of identifying five key strategic objectives for Europe and each individual member state.  No one can argue with setting targets for employment, research and development, climate change, education and social inclusion, of which the most challenging climate change and energy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33, 64, 75, 88, 384 and 397, together.I reported to the House on 1 June 2010 on my reaction to the events of 31 May 2010 involving the killing of nine Turkish citizens on board the MV Mavi Marmara.  This vessel was part of an international flotilla heading for Gaza.  The Government at its meeting that morning condemned the killings and expressed its condolences to the Turkish Government.  I conveyed my condemnation of these events to the ambassador of Israel when I called him in to my Department on 31 May, which I then reported in detail to the Dáil.In the days following, we remained in close contact with the Israeli authorities both through the Israeli embassy to Ireland and our own embassy in Tel Aviv.  Our priority concerns at that point were consular access to the Irish citizens detained from the flotilla, their immediate and unconditional release and also the safety of the further group of Irish citizens on the MV Rachel Corrie, which was then still approaching Gaza.The MVRachel Corrie was intercepted on 5 June and taken into the Israeli port of Ashdod.  On this occasion, thankfully, there was no violence.  The detainees from the flotilla were all released and deported.  I had the opportunity to meet several of them on their return and hear their account of events.  I was impressed by their sincerity and the absolute commitment to peaceful expression of their views on the Gaza blockade.I have called for a credible international investigation of Israel's unacceptable interception in international waters of a humanitarian aid convoy, an operation which resulted in nine deaths.  I fully support the UN Secretary General's proposal for an international investigation which, I believe, has the best chance of gaining international acceptance.  It is the best proposal on the table.  I hope it will be pursued and that pressure to withdraw it will be resisted.There are several outstanding issues which the Government is pursuing or where we are providing assistance to those involved with the Gaza flotilla.  The UN has agreed terms with Israel for the carriage into Gaza of most of the cargo from the initial group of boats seized.  Some of that cargo has already been moved into Gaza and distributed.  It is hoped that a similar agreement can be reached for the cargo of the MV Rachel Corrie, although this has not been finalised yet.  We are also awaiting the return of some or all of the personal effects of the Irish citizens detained.  We will be pursuing further the allegations of ill treatment of some of those detained.The release of the ships themselves is likely to be a longer term issue, particularly if, as seems likely, there are further such sailings in the coming weeks.  I have stated clearly, however, that I consider that the ships should be returned to their owners.The background to all these events is the blockade of Gaza, which I have consistently opposed and condemned over a long period.  My Department is in regular contact with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency about the situation on the ground, and I have often drawn attention to the urgent need to allow reconstruction materials into the territory.In the aftermath of the tragic events of 31 May, there has at last emerged a general consensus that the blockade cannot go on as it has done.  Under pressure from the international community, especially the UN, the United States and the Quartet representative Tony Blair, Israel has agreed to some easing of the restrictions on Gaza, while retaining the right to inspect goods entering the territory.  The list of excluded items was published yesterday; in general, restrictions on all purely civilian goods have been removed.  However, the new Israeli provisions allow only for supervised transfer of building and reconstruction materials to the UN for use on agreed Palestinian Authority-approved work, including infrastructure and repair of housing.  I continue to argue strongly that there should be no restrictions on construction materials required for the building or repair of schools, homes or hospitals.  We will be monitoring closely how this works in practice, as well as the practical impact of these measures on the lives of the people of Gaza.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Minister's discussions with the Israeli ambassador appear to have dealt only with the flotilla.  Did he also discuss the issue of passports?  Today's news of the partial lifting of the blockade is welcome.  It will allow more humanitarian aid, which is badly needed, into Gaza.  The Minister was in Gaza previously.  Will he return there as one of the foreign Ministers who will supervise this?The Minister answered a question about the Rachel Corrie.  I appreciate that the issue is complicated, but how soon would the Minister expect the ship to be out of the dock?Did the Minister bring up, in his discussion with the Israeli ambassador, the issue of settlements in the West Bank?  I understand the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and the US President, Mr. Obama, are discussing that today.  Given that the freeze on the construction of settlements in the West Bank is due to expire in September, did they discuss the possibility of an extension?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The meeting I had with the ambassador was specifically about the flotilla.  I had earlier meetings, as the Deputy knows, with regard to the issue of Irish passports being used in an assassination in Dubai.  I reported that to the House and there was considerable debate about it.  I have had frequent discussions with the Israeli ambassador over the last number of months on different but related issues, and I have raised the issue of settlement in the context of those discussions.  It is our view that Israeli policy, particularly in more recent times, has undermined the voice of moderation, particularly in the Arab world and among Palestinians.  This has in many ways been counter-productive in terms of obtaining a peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict and is slowing down the momentum behind proximity talks and full direct talks.  I have made those points repeatedly to the ambassador and will continue to do so.I was the first European Minister to go into Gaza following the Israeli decision not to allow Ministers in through its borders.  With regard to suggestions in the last couple of days that there could be a further visit by EU Ministers to Gaza, I welcome any visit by EU Ministers, but the terms of the visit must be correct.  We must be cautious about how such visits occur.  I am all in favour of it because the more people who go in, the more the issue is highlighted and the higher its profile.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	99	My question, No. 33, specifically asked about communication the Minister may have had from UNRWA, which is responsible for the repair and building of houses and the distribution of aid.  To put it bluntly, I am interested in the report that may exist or had been sought from John Ging and his staff on whether changes had in fact taken place to enable the import of materials for the repair and building of houses.I welcome the fact that the Minister is holding out for a full international inquiry; this has my support.  My understanding is that some of the arrangements for the distribution of the cargo of the Rachel Corrie have broken down.  This is being handled by the UN mission in Jerusalem, where we are represented.  What is the position on the delivery of the complete cargo and the arrangement of its distribution with UNRA?I also wish to mention issues arising with regard to personal property, namely, the large number of vessels that are in Ashdod at present.  What mechanisms does the Minister envisage for the return of property to those who had it taken from them on the high seas, including the vessels in which they were sailing?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The Deputy and I are of similar mind in terms of what needs to happen with regard to the blockade.  There was an interesting article in the International Herald Tribune yesterday which pointed out some obvious consequences of the blockade, that is, the complete destruction of the private sector in Gaza——
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	102	——and its semi-replacement by business elements under the control of Hamas.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	103	A black economy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It defies any logic.  People who had a long history of trade with Israel were completely undermined.  There is a prospect of developing employment again in Gaza if the private sector is allowed to operate.  That is something I will be pushing.  I met business people in Gaza at the time and they articulated this point of view to me.  They had been wiped out by the blockade.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	105	And they were doing business with Israel.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Yes.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	107	That is the funny thing about it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	108	It is difficult to comprehend.The Rachel Corrie was not under Irish ownership as such.  The UN began by moving the cargo from the initial group of ships, with the exception of one ship whose owners have not yet agreed to the terms agreed by the UN with the Israeli authorities.  The consideration of the cargo of the Rachel Corrie was delayed while this first group was dealt with.  We believe the Free Gaza Movement is broadly ready to accept the terms involved.  It was thought agreement was imminent last week, but this has not yet been finalised.  It may have something to do with the UN’s capacity to handle more material at present.  We are continuing to make inquiries in this regard to make sure it happens.On the return of the vessels, the Turkish Government is in discussion with Israel on a number of critical issues, including this one.  It is likely that any solution applying to Turkish ships will also apply to the ships as a whole.  The Turkish ships involved were both Turkish-owned and sailing under the Turkish flag.  The Rachel Corrie was not sailing under the Irish flag and it is unclear whether it is actually Irish-owned.  I met with some of the crew and we will pursue issues on their behalf.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Deputy Timmins.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I am sorry; I wish to make one final point that may prevent further questions on the issue of property raised by Deputy Higgins.The large number of persons aboard the first group of ships detained left their personal belongings on board.  These were not returned to them individually when they were deported.  Instead, the luggage was sent en masse by aeroplane to Istanbul with the deportees.  Israel says all of the luggage was sent.  In Istanbul, some but not all of the Irish citizens were able to locate their luggage.  However, there remains some confusion because of the large amount of luggage that was moved.  The embassy in Ankara is assisting in identifying personal belongings, but this is obviously not an easy task.  Those on board the Rachel Corrie took their own luggage off the ship and brought it with them when they were deported.  Cameras, telephones and other electronic equipment were confiscated from both groups of detainees; most of this has not yet been returned.  One citizen has provided my Department with a list of missing items, on which we will follow up with the Israeli authorities.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I welcome the Minister's condemnation of the killing of members of the flotilla and the fact that he protested to the Israeli ambassador and sympathised with the Turkish ambassador.  He stated that he had met some members of the flotilla.  One of these was Mr. Ó Luain, whose passport, I am given to understand, was confiscated by the Israeli authorities.  Can the Minister confirm whether this is the case?  If it is, it was an outrageous act.  What has happened Mr. Ó Luain's passport?  Has it been returned or has the Minister made any inquiries about it?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We are following up any allegations of ill treatment towards Irish citizens.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	114	There have been approximately two allegations, but I will come back to the Deputy with the specific number.  We have met one of the individuals and are pursuing that allegation, including the issue of the passport.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I will come back to the Deputy on that.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I too welcome the relaxing of the blockade to a degree, but a number of materials are still restricted.  Does the Minister regard the action of attacking and confiscating the boats and personal effects of people and retaining them as an act of piracy?  Would he also agree that the international outcry and increased boycott and divestment are the real reasons behind the Israeli move to relax the blockade?  If so, will the Minister reconsider his policy on boycott, divestment and sanctions as this seems to have a greater effect on making Israel move on an issue it has not previously moved on.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I believe the ill-conceived strategy of dealing with the flotilla by military means ultimately had the effect of undermining the blockade and that the unacceptable killings and tragic deaths that resulted changed the entire situation.  International pressure and reaction to the military attack on the flotilla was such that it rendered the policy of the blockade unsustainable.  International pressure certainly intensified in the aftermath of the attack on the MV Mavi Marmara.  I believe that is the fundamental reason we see a change with regard to the blockade.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I acknowledge the progress made to date.  Has it been possible for the Minister and his EU colleagues to get greater consensus towards continuous positive pressure for a resolution of the current and fundamental problems in that area, particularly with regard to the need to be able to report positive progress on an ongoing basis?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Notwithstanding the different emphases and perspectives across the European Union with regard to the Middle East, the conclusions arrived at last December under the Swedish Presidency were strong and robust and form a basis for consensus across the Union and a platform for action on the issue.  The issue remains on the agenda on a continuing basis because of events.  The European Union welcomes the initial prioritisation by President Obama's Administration of the Middle Eastern question and, in particular, the appointment of Mr. George Mitchell as peace envoy.  Everybody has been frustrated by the slow progress on starting up proximity talks.  The European Union remains and will remain committed to the issue in terms of resources allocated to the Palestinian Authority and the Administration led by Prime Minister Fayyad.  We must keep pursuing the fundamental issues, as articulated in the December conclusions.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

The report shows clearly that the reckless management and incompetence of the Government are now casting aside the approximate 33,000 people in mortgage arrears and the 250,000 in negative equity.  The strain, anxiety and pressure on these people are difficult to understand or estimate and are far removed from the thinking of the Government.  One of the only recommendations of the report is that both borrowers and lenders should act in good faith at all times.  It is clear from the report that there will be no NAMA for those in negative equity and no sweetheart deals for those in either mortgage arrears or negative equity.  This is a clear and deliberate contrast from the treatment meted out by the Government to both Anglo Irish Bank and NAMA itself.  Greed and incompetence drove a situation where two independent banking reports indicate that 75% of our problems were caused by mismanagement and incompetence at home by Government.In view of the fact that 250,000 people are faced with negative equity and over 30,000 are in mortgage arrears and in view of the fact that last week the Taoiseach admitted that over €20 billion pumped into Anglo Irish Bank has gone into a black hole and will never be seen again and that, apparently, this will be followed by a further €6 billion, €8 billion or as yet undetermined amount, will he confirm that there will be no further moneys pumped into Anglo Irish Bank?  In respect of NAMA — which the Minister for Finance said would provide a wall of cash for business and provide a profit of €4.8 billion — what is the Government's estimate now of the hundreds of millions of losses that may well accrue from it?

There are no sweetheart deals with regard to the National Asset Management Agency.  The dealings are on a loan by loan basis and they have been aggressively valued.  We were the first country to do that and there is every prospect that will be recognised.  There is no question of imposing a national asset management style approach to residential customers.  We do not propose — as the Deputy seems to — to take the assets and sell them, because that is what NAMA will do.  I cannot understand from where the Deputy's fuzzy thinking comes on NAMA.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Deputy's line is a nice line to throw out, but if he thinks about it he will see it has the very opposite effect of what he claims he is trying to do.  The Deputy should not put out his little by-lines and then expect they will not be referred to in the response.  There is no question of doing that.  What we are trying to do and what the interim report on mortgage arrears and personal debt is trying to do is to bring forward practical steps.  The report makes certain recommendations to the Financial Regulator, which will be acted on and which he will seek to implement.  Thankfully, the number of repossessions here has remained very low.  This reflects the measures that have been put in place in the past two years and the code of conduct for covered institutions has had some effect.  The need for people to engage, the question of a resolution process that will provide for consistency across the board for all institutions, and the avoidance of payment of penalty interest for borrowers who obtain the mortgage interest supplement — these are all of important practical assistance to the 30,000 people who find themselves in arrears for 90 days or more and the similar number who may have entered into forbearance arrangements with their lenders.  While it is a big issue for every individual family which finds itself in that situation, in the overall context of the number of mortgages taken out in this country, the number in difficulty is a small percentage of the total.  However, there is no room for complacency.  The work of the group is ongoing and it will come forward with further recommendations in several months time.  It is not correct for the Deputy to make the assertions he is making in this regard.In regard to the NAMA situation, the central projection has been brought forward and that report will be published today or tomorrow.  The central projection suggests there will be some profit made by NAMA.  It also sets out other scenarios, some of which would see a higher profit for NAMA in certain circumstances and, given that we are dealing with a ten-year projection, it also refers to a lesser case scenario of some losses.  Any such losses will be levyable as a surcharge on banks in any event.  The portrayal of the report as showing that NAMA will be loss-making is not correct.  The central projection sets out a profit over that period based on the data it has now, and those data relate to the information it has received as a result of the engagement it has had since last autumn with the banks.  The draft plan stated very clearly in its first sentence that it relates to information that was then being furnished by the banks.  There has been a rigorous and aggressive assessment of all loans on a loan-by-loan basis, and what has emerged is set out in the annual report today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	127	There is no fuzzy thinking here.  The Taoiseach said the taxpayer would not be at a loss because of the injection into Anglo Irish Bank.  We now have a situation where he admits that more than €20 billion is lost forever down a black hole.  Think of what could be done in our country if that type of money were being pumped into construction, infrastructure or jobs.Second, the Taoiseach was wrong when he and his Minister said that NAMA would provide a wall of cash.  More than 800 businesses have gone to the wall since the start of the year.  Some 452,000 people are out of work and thousands more are facing an uncertain future because of the reckless mismanagement of the economy by the Government.Third, the Taoiseach was wrong when he said there would be no sweetheart deals.  Am I to understand that on a loan-by-loan basis, NAMA has already made particular conditions for one very large developer who is unable to comply with the loan conditions granted in the first instance?  There are no sweetheart deals for those in negative equity.  There are no sweetheart deals for those who cannot pay their mortgages.  Yet it appears the same old circle comes around again for Fianna Fáil in government whereby particular operators can be given sweetheart deals.The Taoiseach also said — and he was wrong on this — that NAMA would provide a profit of €4.8 billion.  Yet the Minister for Finance himself — not anybody on this side of the House — spelled out a situation where, he said, hundreds of millions of euro could potentially be lost.  If the Taoiseach is saying the Minister's thinking is fuzzy in this regard, he should take that up with the Minister.The Taoiseach was wrong in respect of the wall of cash; he was wrong in respect of the sweetheart deals; he was wrong in respect of credit for business; and he was wrong in his assessment of how this process would help the economy to pick up.  Will he at least take his courage in his hands, as the leader of the worst Government in the history of this State, and go to the country in order to let the people decide what they want in terms of government for the future?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Here we go again.The scenario outlined in the draft plan for the National Asset Management Agency of a profit of €4.8 billion was based, as stated in the first sentence of that report, on the information being provided by the banks at the time.  The agency has now produced its quarterly report, as required under the Act, and is setting out its central projection based on current asset valuations, projecting forward for the next ten years.  The board is making the point that the agency should emerge with a profit, as it sees it.  The report sets out other scenarios where the agency might make a higher profit or else make some losses.  If losses do emerge, they will be levyable on the financial institutions concerned.That is what the board of NAMA is saying, but the Deputy is misrepresenting that.  He is trying to suggest that I am saying one thing and the Minister is saying another.  The National Asset Management Agency is making the assessment on the basis of the detailed data it now has which are based on the loans it has brought over from the balance sheets of the banks.  The purpose of the agency is to provide for a viable banking system and to provide the prospect of credit.  The Deputy is suggesting he has the right policies, but his policy in this regard was to default.  The European monetary system is prepared to bring forward provision in the order of €750 billion to protect the currency on the basis that it does not wish to see any default.  The Deputy, however, is bringing forward the idea that we in this country we can have a default mechanism.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I too have been reading the report from the Government dealing with the problems mortgage holders are having in repaying their loans.  The report includes 41 recommendations.  There will be a lot of letters written back and forth between lenders and borrowers but the only firm recommendation I can see is that the one-year moratorium on legal action by lenders cannot be extended.  That stands in stark contrast to what we are learning now about the real situation in NAMA.Yesterday there were two newspaper articles, one in The Irish Times and the other in the Irish Independent, both of which seem to be based on fairly well informed briefings, both stating that what we were told in the original business plan for NAMA turns out not to be the case at all.  The original plan told us that 40% of the loans that would be transferred to NAMA would be performing loans which would be cash flow generating.  It turns out, if the newspaper reports are accurate, that this applies not to 40% but to 25% of loans and that, as a consequence, the projections made for NAMA will not now be fulfilled.  The Minister for Finance came into the House when he was proposing the NAMA legislation and told us all that NAMA would not only wash its face but would make a profit of €4.8 billion.  If these reports are accurate, there could instead turn out to be a loss of several hundred millions of euro.Is it true that only 25%, not 40%, of loans are performing based on the case-by-case analysis that has been done by NAMA?  If that is true, can the Taoiseach explain to us why the original business plan for NAMA that was presented to the House has turned out be a bit of a financial fairy tale?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that when the Minister for Finance came before us and asked us to approve NAMA, that he did so on the basis of projections which now turn out not to be accurate?  If it is the case that they are not accurate, can the Taoiseach inform us why this is the case?  Is it because the banks lied in providing the original information on which the 40% estimate was made?

Was there a situation whereby after NAMA was announced a certain amount of financial hanky panky took place and people decided that if the taxpayer were to end up taking on this burden, then perhaps a given loan did not have to be repaid at all?  Is there evidence of growing non-repayment from the time NAMA was announced?  This is all based on newspaper reports.  Has the Government received this report from NAMA?  If so, when will it be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	147	There has been some misunderstanding of the plan in advance of its publication.  It is not true to say that NAMA now expects to make a loss.  There are three scenarios set out in the plan.  Under the central scenario, based on current expected asset recovery values NAMA is projected to make a profit.  There are two other scenarios which are variations on the central projection, one in which NAMA makes a larger profit and one in which it makes a loss.

As the House is aware, there was much surprise in the banking system as to the aggressive nature of the writedowns with which NAMA came up.  NAMA has decided, based on the data it has, what the value of those loans is and has paid accordingly.  That is the reason.I refer to the performance of loans.  Some 25% of the loans are performing, but that does not change the value of collateral and present asset projections.  That they cannot be paid by the borrower does not take away from the fact of the value of the underlying asset and the collateral which applies to it.

This was done by NAMA and it has brought forward its central projection today which suggests that it still believes, based on the present asset values at the present time, that it will make a profit.  With regard to whether it ends up with a loss, that would be addressed by a levy on the banks as the legislation provides for.

The Taoiseach's Minister for Finance stated 40% of loans were performing in the draft or daft plan that was presented to us for NAMA.  The Taoiseach is now acknowledging that it is 25%.  Originally, we were told the discount applied would be 30%.  Of course, it turned out that when NAMA got to work on it, more aggressively it appears than anyone in Government, the discount is significantly more.  The real situation is that what the Taoiseach has presented to us and what has been presented to us repeatedly by Government in respect of NAMA has turned out in the cold light of day not to be accurate.  The Taoiseach has been way off.  He was way off on the numbers of performing loans.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	172	That is not the case at all.  The Minister has been committed to dealing with the matter in an up-front way at all times.  The central projection that NAMA has set out based on the up-to-date situation is that it will make a profit of something of the order of €1 billion.  That is the central projection.  It is set out over a ten year projection period based on current expected asset recovery values.  During the next ten years issues will arise in terms of values and the recovery of the economy etc.  This will all be dealt with on a case by case basis.  It proves the wisdom of the NAMA approach of dealing with every loan on a case-by-case basis.  It also disproves the idea put forward by the Opposition at the time that in some way there was some padding going on between the banks, those clients and NAMA as regards what the value would be.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I hold no brief for that.  The point I am making relates to the policy response to the banking crisis.  The asset management agency set up will enable us to obtain a viable banking system.  The proposal at the time from the Labour Party was to temporarily nationalise all the banks.  If one nationalised all the banks one would be allowing the taxpayers to fund arrangements of all those banks and all the capital required.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	176	We have nationalised them anyway.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	177	No, we have not actually.  The Labour Party's proposal was to nationalise all the banks.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Can we have the Taoiseach without interruption, please?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Labour Party's proposal was to nationalise all the banks, including the commercial banks.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	180	No.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	181	That was the position.  The fact of the matter is, thankfully, Bank of Ireland has raised capital on private markets which has saved the taxpayer that consideration.This report will be published.  It will set out the situation and the central projection.  I am outlining the factual position and the other scenarios.  The report is simply making those scenarios available to the public so that people can see over the next ten years what the variation in projections will be.  The important thing for taxpayers to know in respect of the NAMA operations is that were any losses to emerge after this ten year process, these issues are subject to levy and there will be a surcharge on the banks.  That will go back on the banks' liability as far as we are concerned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	182	As Deputy Gogarty would say, "It is a nightmare".
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with several notices under Standing Order 32 and I will call on deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  First, I call Deputy Padraig McCormack.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Under Standing Order 32 I wish to raise a matter of local and national importance, that is, the cutback of €2.5 million in HSE funding for the Galway city and county Brothers of Charity services and the further proposed cutbacks of €2 million which will make it impossible for the Brothers of Charity to continue its excellent and cost effective service to more than 1,000 recipients in Galway city and county.  I refer to the extra burden this will place on families providing home care who will have respite services discontinued or greatly reduced.  I call on the Minister to provide the necessary funds to enable the Brothers of Charity and other service providers continue their excellent services to the most vulnerable in our society.  The Minister should note that the Brothers of Charity service has already achieved a 4% saving in expenditure this year and is now being penalised for its efficiency.  I call on the Minister to ensure the funding restored to enable the Brothers of Charity to continue its services.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for clarification by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation regarding the measures he is putting in place to prevent the closure of B3 Cables and secure the 100 plus jobs at the plant which are under threat, as the company is now in receivership, with a mere six days to find a buyer, and the retention of this company is of the utmost importance to the economic viability of County Longford and to the highly skilled workers concerned.  The loss of 100 jobs in Longford is the equivalent of the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in Dublin.  We need to do all we can to support the workers and, more important, to ensure the Government has done all it can to prevent job losses.  Fianna Fáil has allowed Longford to become an unemployment blackspot.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, cancelled roads projects across the country, including three sections of the N24 in south Tipperary — the Carrick-on-Suir bypass, the Clonmel bypass and the stretch from Cahir to Bansha.  These projects are vital for the infrastructure of south Tipperary and are needed badly to create jobs in the construction sector.  If the Government is serious about economic recovery, the key to achieving it is investment in infrastructure to develop our country while meaning that we can get some of the 450,000 people currently unemployed back to work.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely the urgent need, first, to reverse the proposed cuts for people with a disability; second, to deplore the cuts to respite services in Dublin and around the country; and, third, to demand the implementation of the disability strategy and call on the Government to make all people with a disability and their families a priority matter.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Having consider the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 32.

The last matter I tabled was in 1993 during the Digital crisis and my request was granted.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	205	With all due respect, that is not related to this proposal.

I am making a proposal to amend the Order of Business.  Will the Taoiseach, in the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for this sector, Deputy John Moloney, consider allowing additional time tonight to address this serious issue?  Deputy McCormack and I raised this matter under Standing Order 32 and I have no doubt Deputies across the floor of the House want to address this serious matter and the Minster of State is willing to address it.  We are finishing at 10 p.m. and there will be late sittings before the Dáil rises on Thursday, for example, tomorrow night.  Can we not afford the same opportunity this evening to address the issue of the further curtailment of essential services for people with disabilities, in particular, children with severe intellectual disability, before the protest arrives on the streets of Dublin and at the gates of the House tomorrow?  We should do this business tonight.  I propose that we extend the sitting by an hour to accommodate that opportunity and I appeal to the Government to accommodate it.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I support this call.  The cuts taking place in Limerick, Dublin and the Brothers of Charity in Galway——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The Order of Business does not contemplate this.  We simply cannot accommodate a debate on the Order of Business on the matter.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Will the Ceann Comhairle give the Taoiseach an opportunity to reply to the request?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	210	This is not the place.  There should be brief questions on the Order of Business
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Taoiseach has control over the business of the House.  People looking after adult children and saving the State considerable money are being put at risk because they will have no respite or break from the care they give 24-7.  They will break down.  I met many of these parents in Galway yesterday and they are at the end of their tether.  They are getting on in years.  We will end up losing money in this regard as a State as these adult children will end up in long-term care because their parents will no longer be able to cope.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Deputy has made his point.

These people will be in Dublin tomorrow and they will on the streets on Galway and Limerick as well.  This is a national issue that requires a national response.

I ask him to respond accordingly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	223	These matters are being worked on by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, over the course of this week anyway.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Minister of State is not doing the business.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	228	It is not agreed.  The reason it is not agreed is that I understand there are approximately 80 amendments.  One of these amendments is key to what the Government proposes, the method by which head shops can be closed down.  I am informed by Deputy Shatter that the Government is using a very circuitous route indeed.  A range of Deputies wish to speak on this Bill.  It is not possible to deal with 80 amendments in the time allocated and for that reason, and because of the importance of finding a better way than the Government proposal to deal with this conclusively and swiftly, I object to the Bill being guillotined.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The Labour Party is opposed to the use of the guillotine on this Bill. This is an example of the serial application of the guillotine by Government in the last couple of weeks before the summer recess.  It is not a good way to make law.  As Deputy Kenny said, it does not give adequate time to deal with the amendments that have been tabled for this Bill.  We are opposed to the use of the guillotine.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	230	With 80 amendments, even if it were to commence now, with 7 p.m. as the guillotine time, there would be approximately one minute and a half per amendment.  This is just how absurd this proposition is; it is totally unacceptable.  This is a hugely important issue and more time needs to be provided.  We oppose the guillotine absolutely in this case.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	231	This is important legislation that needs to be enacted this week.  There are a few substantive amendments which can be handled in the time available.  The Bill was discussed on Second Stage on Friday last and this was an opportunity for Members to give their views.  I think there is broad agreement in the House about the need for this legislation and we have to proceed with it in the circumstances.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business agreed to?

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Tá Pairtí an Lucht Oibre i gcoinne an mholta seo freisin.  The Labour Party is essentially opposing the guillotine.  With a Bill composed of two sections, the second of which concerns the Short Title of the Bill and the collective citation, and with one amendment tabled, applying the guillotine to this Bill is part of the Government's addiction to guillotines.  This Bill can be finished within the time and the Labour Party opposes the proposal.

Sinn Féin Deputies oppose the proposal in respect of the Údarás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Bill.  I listened to Deputy O'Shea make the point about addiction to guillotines in his opposition to this proposal.  In proposing this measure, the Government is certainly not addicted to facing the electorate.  This Bill defers the opportunity for the electorate to pass judgment on the performance of the Government at any level across the State.  The Government does not have the willingness to go before the electorate in any part of the country in any election situation and God forbid the Government must face the electorate in any of the constituencies where by-elections are pending.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Can the Taoiseach indicate what Bills are likely to be published during the forthcoming recess?  A number of Bills have been referred to that were to have been published during the course of this Dáil session but obviously will not be.  However, I understand a number of Bills will be published during the summer recess and the Taoiseach should give an indication in this regard.  I refer to the commitment in the programme for Government to transfer foreshore licensing to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and to integrate it with the planning process.  In view of the energy requirements and indications of serious investment, what is the status of that commitment and will such a transfer and integration require legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Arrangements have been made in practical terms for the foreshore licensing issue to be dealt with by that Department as matters stand.  While I do not know what further legislative arrangements are needed for it, the practical issue has been dealt with.  Six Bills have been published and one Bill, namely, the criminal justice (defence and the dwelling) Bill, has been approved by the Cabinet and awaits publication.  A further eight Bills that were not on the A list have also been published during this session.In respect of Bills that have not been published to date, the education patronage Bill has been submitted to the Cabinet for approval very soon.  The local government (Dublin mayor and regional authority) Bill also is an issue that is being worked on at present.  As for the environmental liability Bill, among other things, the Government awaits advice from the Attorney General on an issue in that regard.  The biological weapons Bill is in the final stages of being agreed between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Parliamentary Counsel.  There have been delays to the progress of the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill due to drafting difficulties pertaining to the enforcement of court orders relating to maintenance debtors.  The provisions of the criminal justice (legal aid) Bill require development by the Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  As for the mental capacity Bill, drafting is ongoing but has been delayed.  Work continues on this issue and much effort will be required to have it published during the summer recess.

First, the motion passed in the Dáil on 20 January 2010 concerning an inquiry into banking provided that an independent statutory commission of investigation would be established by 30 June 2010.  I understand the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service has been considering the Government's proposals regarding such a commission.  When will these proposals be brought before the House?  I presume this will take place either tomorrow or on Thursday, before the Dáil breaks up for its summer recess.Second, media reports over the weekend stated that Mr. Colm McCarthy has been given another interesting task by the Government.  This time, it is to have a look around to see if there is anything worth selling.  The Taoiseach should indicate whether the Government intends to publish the terms of reference that have been given to Mr. McCarthy and whether they will be brought before the House.

There is no predetermined outcome in respect of any of that.  Given the resources available to it and the challenges it faces, any prudent Government would be obliged to consider all areas but not on a predetermined basis.As for the proposals regarding the commission of inquiry to which the Deputy referred, it is more than likely that this will take place on Thursday.

First, I refer to the cutbacks affecting people with disability, intellectual disability included, to which Members have already referred.  A Disability Act was adopted a number of years ago and much of what now is unfolding runs entirely counter to the spirit if not the letter of that legislation, imperfect though it was.  Given that the Disability Act was not rights-based, which is the great tragedy of the passage of that Act, do all the cutbacks that now are taking place require legislation?  Is a disability (amendment) Bill pending?  How does the Taoiseach reconcile what the Government stated on the record at the time of the passage of the Disability Act with everything that now is unfolding?  Many unfortunate people——

However, another area could be examined that I raised with the Tánaiste only last Thursday.  While I have yet to be able to secure the full information regarding the State's total commitment to ground rent, I believe it to be substantial, given the portfolio of properties that were advised to me in a reply to a recent parliamentary question.  Would it not be appropriate to revisit the entire proposition behind the proposed to ground rent Bill, which rested for many years on the list of promised legislation but which has disappeared entirely off the Richter scale recently?  Would this not be a worthwhile area to address now and to have the matter done and dusted once and for all in the interests of the State coffers and of individual private citizens——

The issue that is arising, as I mentioned on Leaders' Questions last week, is that as we seek to try to protect front line services we must consider how we rearrange the non-front line service part of the sector.  There is a significant number of section 38 and section 39 organisations, which have done an excellent job and which are very committed, but in the context of sustainable levels of service and developing services for the future we must be prepared to consider whether we can reorganise how that is delivered.  The efforts that are being made by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and the Department of Health and Children, not just this week but in recent times is to try to achieve that.  I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that everything we can do in that respect is being investigated.

I accept there are difficulties in the area.  There is no doubt about that.  There will be difficulties in many areas but the Deputy's approach will be as predictable as usual.

Deputies Kenny and Gilmore raised the matter today as well.

We are not scheduled to sit on Friday.  The Minister is briefing the Taoiseach to the effect that Second Stage has started in the House and we could conclude it on Friday.  Nobody on this side of the House is going to vote against the principle of the Bill.  There will be many amendments with which we could deal for the remainder of July or early September.  The Bill has been awaited for up to eight years.  I suggest it be scheduled for debate until 1.30 p.m. or 2 p.m. on Friday.  While I cannot speak for Fine Gael I suspect its position is the same.  We will not vote against the principle of the Bill.  There is no need to retain the troops in the House.  We could get the Bill ready for Committee Stage if the Taoiseach is agreeable.

The difficulties being experienced by those living in apartments have been hugely exacerbated by the fire brigade sales of apartments, the involvement of receivers and liquidators in the sales and this will get worse in the context of NAMA's involvement.  There is an urgent need to address those issues.  I support Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion.  The legislation is badly needed.

There was an extensive report in the media today about a revised national development programme, particularly in regard to roads and public transport such as the Luas and the metro.  Can the Taoiseach confirm whether the Government is producing a revised national development programme?  If so, when is it likely to be published?During the consideration of the NAMA legislation, when the Minister for Finance very graciously accepted a number of Labour Party amendments, we were promised that when the revised NAMA business plan was available — it was submitted to the Government last week — it would be published and made available to Opposition spokespersons.  Before we all go away on what I hope will be happy holidays, could the Opposition see the revised NAMA business plan?

On foot of our doing so, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 was published in July 2008.  One of its provisions was to ban below-cost selling of alcohol.  Before the secondary legislation could be enacted, approval had to be obtained from the European Commission, which was forthcoming six or seven months subsequent to the passage of the primary legislation.  That was over 18 months ago and it is two years since the primary legislation was passed.  The Minister explained he was not going to bring forward the secondary legislation on the basis of his desire for a co-ordinated approach on both sides of the Border.  He has had 18 months to achieve that.  When will we see the secondary legislation and a ban on below-cost selling and advertising of alcohol?  Advertisements are in our newspapers every day and alcohol is causing carnage in communities around the country.

In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:""Authority" refers to An tÚdarás Rialála um Shubstaintí Neamhleigheasacha Sícighníomhacha translated into English as the Non-Medicinal Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority;".I have a number of amendments.  With regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I submitted two versions of amendments that in some ways have the same effect.  This was in anticipation of one being ruled out of order for imposing a charge on the Exchequer.  I am thankful that, on this occasion, this has not happened.In legislation I put together earlier this year, I suggested that I do not believe the Minister's approach to psychoactive substances will produce the desired result, that is, ensure the poisons currently being sold in head shops will no longer be on sale and that the profiteering of head shops will be put to an end.I suggested in my legislation that we set up an authority, using expertise already available to the State, that would decide whether products on sale are poisonous and can be regulated and licensed in a specific format determined by the legislation.  Some of my suggestions are replicated in amendment No. 7, which outlines the role and functions of a body I call the "Non-Medicinal Psychoactive Substances Regulatory Authority".  The amendment outlines what the functions of the authority should be.I suggest this mechanism as the current mechanism of banning of substances has failed because it takes too long.  One should bear in mind the rate at which new products are being produced.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has suggested and proven that new products are coming on the market at a rate of one per fortnight.  The legislation the Minister has proposed is not capable of dealing with that.  If one obliged the people who wish to sell the products to fund the proposed authority that would investigate those products, it would have the desired effect of taking the vast majority of the products currently sold in head shops off the shelves.  They are poisonous and induce in those ingesting or injecting them a psychoactive experience.  We have received communications from doctors, nurses and drugs workers throughout the country attesting to the products' effects, particularly on young people.  I refer to those presenting in hospitals with various psychoses and other medical problems caused by ingesting one or several of the substances in question or by mixing them with legal drugs such as alcohol or certain pharmaceuticals.When approaching this matter, I considered how the Irish Medicines Board works and the degree to which products for human consumption are tested before being put on the market.  In this case, the motive is profit, not medicinal.  Since the products are supposedly for recreational purposes, the onus is on those who wish to sell them to pay for the research.  This would have the effect of limiting, if not totally removing, these products from public sale.  It would also allow such a body to place restrictions on advertising and give it power over where shops can be located.  It would be required to support An Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise so that they could know what products are entering the market.A flaw in the Bill is that it places an onus on Garda superintendents to have the expertise to identify products.  Under the Bill, the Garda must use a civil procedure to force shop owners and those behind the counter to stop selling.  In a system in which the products would be properly identified, calling on the requisite expertise would be easier than giving the work to the Forensic Science Laboratory, which is already under considerable pressure dealing with other illegal drugs.  Taking the Minister's route will add to the pressure, as a significant range of substances would need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  If head shop owners or others who are first served with a notice and subsequently with a prohibition order challenge them, the forensic lab will be called on to prove that the product being referred to as a psychoactive substance is just that.Questions arise around the identification of products.  They do not have the same consistency and their packaging is changed regularly.  We know of warehouses and factories in this city that have repackaged some of this material.  What was Snow one day might not be Snow the next.  Major issues will arise in respect of whether a court can proceed with a prohibition order against a product that is not defined or licensed.  Unless a superintendent purchases the product, identifies its consistencies and ingredients and repeats the exercise at a later date to have a prohibition order applied, the case will fail.  However, it would be key if an authority comprising people from the Irish Medicines Board, the Food Safety Authority, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Garda, the alcohol and drug research unit of the Health Research Board and the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, could be put in place and its collective expertise relied upon prior to the application of any prohibition, notice or order.  In anticipation of my amendment being refused for incurring a cost on the State, even though what I have suggested would be self-funding, I have recommended that these functions could, at a minimum, be performed by the NACD.Other Deputies are eager to contribute and time is limited, so I will not speak for long.  It is crazy that we have 80 amendments and only 80 minutes in which to deal with them.  Psychoactive substances pose a significant issue, one we should have been addressing on a greater scale in recent years and months.  We on this side of the House awaited the Minister's legislation with baited breath.  If we had a proper Committee Stage, we could have teased out the vast number of problems that will arise from the Bill.The head shop industry is lucrative.  One shop owner boasted to party members outside his premises that he had a turnover of €20,000 per week.  We all know the case of one owner who just happened to have €500,000 in cash in a safe in his building when it burned down.  Regrettably, the money did not burn with it and the owner managed to get it back.  Some of the characters involved in the industry are unscrupulous and I guarantee the Minister that all of that money was pumped back into it and into the poor unfortunates purchasing Snow, Blow, mephedrone, WHACK and so on.  While picketing outside some of those shops, I saw the unfortunate characters abusing these drugs.  Some are long-term abusers of other illegal drugs like heroin and cocain and are supplementing therm with products purchased in head shops.  No rules or regulations prevent these people from going into those shops.People in the drug rehabilitation field have significant concerns about the industry's effects.  For this reason, I will not oppose the Bill.  I welcome it, but I have problems with its formulation.  In many ways, I wish it well because I will not have the opportunity to table a Bill of my own, but I have concerns and I do not want to tell people in one or two years' time that I told them so because of legal challenges to the mechanism being introduced by the Minister.  He and I received the legal opinion of Garrett Sheehan and Partners, which was supplied to us on behalf of the head shops.  I do not agree with that office's reasoning, but I agree that the offences cannot be vague.  According to Garrett Sheehan and Partners, if what constitutes offending ingredients is vague and uncertain, the trial of an alleged offence based on these ingredients is not in due course of law.  The legal opinion supplies a number of quotes on the question of vagueness.  The definitions in the Bill are vague.  Similarly, using civil remedies instead of criminal sanctions is as wrong now as it was in the case of ASBOs.  The usage level of ASBOs since their introduction shows that gardaí shy away from using civil law in such a way because of uncertainty regarding the legal footing.I have major concerns about the Bill.As I said, amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, and 7 to 9, inclusive, outline a mechanism for ensuring we have a body in the State which can react quickly to new products and can give expert advice to members of An Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise.  It could give advice to the Government too, if there is need for additional legislation to close loopholes behind which the people behind head shops hide at the moment.  Some of these people have successfully taken court cases to find loopholes in terms of other activities within the State.  I do not want to come back to the Dáil in a couple of months after this Bill has failed the test of the courts.Obviously, the Attorney General's advice is to the effect that the Bill is constitutional and that it will stand the test of time in terms of dealing with the scourge that is in our society.  I am concerned too that steps have not been taken by the State in the past four years to deal properly with educational aspects, to advise the public and young people in particular about the dangers of head shops and their products.  I have had quite a number of replies from the Minister in terms of this, that and the other which were promised, but have not come to fruition, including the pledge of more support programmes in schools such as Walk Tall and others.  He appears to forget regarding the Walk Tall programme in schools that the supports have been withdrawn.  Another programme which he said he would rely on in the rolling out of advice to teachers, etc., the newly formed professional development for teachers, was to provide support on a regional basis.  I have been informed that there is no drug-specific focus to that at all.  It is a question of clutching at straws.The same is true in relation to the special personnel involved in health education.  Staff there have been reduced in 2009.  Hopefully the Government's promised rollout of an education and publicity campaign will happen within weeks, as I was told last week, and that not only will there be a legislative attack on head shops, but education and rehabilitation will also be addressed through various campaigns.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I fully understand that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on this issue and I appreciate the work the Deputy has carried out on this particular amendment.  However, there are two aspects to this, the first of which is the setting up of another regulatory authority.  There has been criticism to the effect that there are too many regulatory authorities in this State.  While the Deputy says it would be self-financing, what he proposes in his series of amendments is, in effect, a replication of what already is being carried out by the Department of Health and Children regarding the identification and classification of specified psychoactive substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I do not see the merit of setting up another body to do what is already being done by the Department of Health and Children.As I said in my Second Stage speech, the whole idea of this legislation is designed to be as simple as possible from a criminal viewpoint, while being drafted in such a way that it is fair and acknowledges due process for the people who may be affected by it.  We have the criminal sanction, as laid out in the relevant section, as well as the civil procedure in sections 7, 8 and 10, the prohibition notice and closure order.  They are calibrated in such a way as to give people involved notice, while taking due account of the rights of those involved who are transacting business.I cannot accept it.  I have not seen a copy of the letter from Sheehan and Company, and I understand it was forwarded directly to the Attorney General's office.  For some reason we cannot locate a copy in the Department but I understand that, having seen the letter, the Attorney General is happy the legislation is constitutional and that the procedures laid down in the Bill in relation to the criminal offence of selling, distributing, importing and exporting of specified psychoactive substances are correct.That is one aspect, and the other is the civil procedure which ultimately could become a criminal procedure in that a breach of the order of the court would become an offence of itself.  I entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy about the scourge of the illegal business that is transacted out of head shops.  That is the very reason the Government has acted expeditiously in that the Minister for Health and Children brought to Cabinet a month or two ago the proposal to ban specified substances.  That is why, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, the issue of head shops was addressed, where significant raids were carried out on such premises around the country.  Out of 102 known to the Garda Síochána, virtually every one was closed.  A number, about 40 or so, have either re-opened or are still open.  They may very well be selling non-psychoactive substances, but I understand they are being kept under significant review by the Garda.As a result of the firm view the Government reached in its discussions in relation to this matter, the Minister, Deputy Pat Carey, the Minister for Health and Children and I met on a regular basis over the last couple of months, as did our officials, to see how we might deal with this once and for all, learning from experience in other countries.  In those jurisdictions, they had been using misuse of drug-type legislation, but to a certain extent, as soon as they banned one substance, another was introduced.  I saw this in the North some time back, when I met with David Ford, MLA, for the first time since he became Minister of Justice.  On that day in particular, the UK Government announced it was banning specific substances, including mephedrone.  It immediately occurred to me that if Britain and Northern Ireland were banning this, there might be a new aspect to cross-Border shopping if we did not do something quickly in relation to it.  I subsequently found out that the UK had announced it was banning these, but had not gone through the procedure of notification under the technical directive required.  It had to give three months notice or else use the emergency procedure.As the House knows, we used the emergency procedure in relation to the banning of the specified substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and we also looked at the possibility then of bringing in separate criminal law legislation and using the civil procedure.  We referred that to the European Commission when the heads of the Bill were finalised by Government, and the emergency procedure laid down in the directive gave us the approval to proceed.   We also referred this to the European Commission when the heads of the Bill were finalised by the Government.  The emergency procedure laid down in the directive gave us approval to proceed.  As I stated on Second Stage, the Commission also indicated it would bring forward European-wide proposals on the banning of psychoactive substances.I believe we are ahead of the posse on this.  Recently, when I met with my UK counterpart, Theresa May, the UK authorities were very interested in the belt-and-braces approach we adopted in this matter.  The UK authorities were having the same difficulty in that when a substance was banned, almost immediately another came on-stream.  We saw that already when the Government made the order against specified substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  We were under no illusion at the time that this would the end of the issue.  We were proved correct in that as soon as these substances were banned, new substances such as Whack came on the market.  Allied to what we are doing in this legislation, the Minister for Health and Children is proceeding to have the banning of such substances examined under the Misuse of Drugs Act.My Department and the Department of Health and Children have used the Forensic Science Laboratory to identify psychoactive substances.  Under this legislation the laboratory will be designated with the power to use others.  While I understand the Deputy's intention to establish a regulatory agency, I do not have a great record for establishing such authorities.  I may have set up a few but, by and large, I have tried to steer away from them.  The Department of Health and Children is up to speed in banning specific substances as they come on the market.This legislation which is relatively simple has been vetted by the Attorney General for its constitutionality.  Since Second Stage, I had further discussions with the Attorney General on some of the amendments and he is still happy with the legislative procedures.I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	345	No one can dispute the analysis set out by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  He put his finger on it when he spoke about the capacity of these products to re-invent themselves.  At the same time, I have sympathy with the Minister in saying we do not want to create a new regulatory body unnecessarily which may duplicate an existing one.  However, the treatment of this subject by the Minister for Health and Children and her Department is not exactly encouraging, given the length of time it took them to take the simple step of adding certain products to the list of products disallowed under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  One would have thought that would have been a relatively simple straightforward exercise compared to the task this Bill sets out to do.I am somewhat discomfited by the remarks by the Minister that the submission from Garrett Sheehan & Partners, solicitors on behalf of the head shop owners, went AWOL.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Minister did not only hear about it.  I told him about it and quoted from it on Second Stage.  The Minister should not shake his head on this.  I know he believes he has never been wrong about anything but I did raise this on Second Stage.I would have thought it would have been essential for him to look at it to see how those representing the head shops view the legislation.Deputy Ó Snodaigh touched on one main issue concerning the apparent vagueness of definitions used in the legislation.  The Minister is not doing what his opposite number in the Britain is doing, namely identifying the characteristics that make up a particular product.  Rather the Minister is defining it by its capacity to have mind-altering effects.  On Second Stage, I described that as the most innovative part of the Bill.  I commend it and hope it works.  The point, however, I was drawing to the Minister's attention was that the lawyers advising the head shop owners believe it is too vague and open to challenge, instancing the jurisprudence that supports their contention.  The Minister, meanwhile, is relying on messages transferred to him that the Attorney General is happy with the provision.  There were arguments raised in the lawyers' document which merit an examination by the Minister and his faithful servants.

While it is a relatively simple Bill, there are complexities in ensuring it does not have unintended consequences.As I said on Second Stage, it endeavours to deal with unregulated psychoactive substances while, at the same time, ensuring we do not ban regulated psychoactive substances.  The legislation already gives the Minister the power to exclude further products that might find themselves subject to the legislation unintentionally.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 7 and 8 propose the setting up of a new authority, the non-medicinal psychoactive substances regulatory authority.  I am loath to set up new authorities, mindful of the criticism that they are just quangos that very often end up looking after themselves rather than specific interests.  In this case, I do not want to add a major cost to the State which is why I propose it would comprise people working in other related public sector bodies.Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 9 propose that the roles and functions of the authority should be to identify the substances that it considers to be psychoactive substances for the purposes of the Act, to establish, update and maintain a register of the substances it identifies as being psychoactive substances for the purposes of the Act, and to provide guidance and support to An Garda Síochána and to Customs and Excise.  These functions could be added to the remit of an existing committee within the Department, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, part of whose role is to advise.  The reason I suggest this is that the committee has been quite effective, although we have sometimes been critical of the Government's role in combating the illegal drugs market.  The people on the advisory committee have built up an expertise in illegal drugs, which is important in dealing with the issue of head shops.  So far, the Department of Health and Children has been slow to react because of the way in which the Misuse of Drugs Acts work and because we must always refer issues upwards to Europe.  We must obtain permission from Europe to protect public health, which is ludicrous and should be changed.  If the Minister is talking to the Minister for Health and Children or other European Justice Ministers, he should advocate the enabling of faster reactions so that we in Ireland are not prevented from reacting to public health issues.In addition, there should be some sort of reaction from the EU as a whole.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  Every fortnight when we have our committee meeting we are given a list of products that have been banned or un-banned under anti-dumping legislation.  It seems that China, in particular, is dumping many of these products on the European Union, and I find it strange that steps have not been taken to protect the European Union by the implementation of anti-dumping measures against such companies, as has been done for Chinese steel and a range of other products.If the Minister is not happy to set up a regulatory authority to deal with this issue without any major cost to the State — and he does not seem to be — would he be willing to consider giving the role of identifying substances to the National Advisory Committee on Drugs?  This would not deal with all of my concerns as it would not have all the powers I suggested the regulatory authority should have, but it would help any prosecution under the Minister's legislation.It looks as though we will support this Bill.  Members of the Garda Síochána require some type of expertise when they go to serve prohibition notices and orders.  They need to know they can rely on a source of expertise when they go to court at an early stage for a prohibition order and, later, a closure order.  This expertise must be able to stand the test of a court hearing.Even though the burden of proof is lower under this Bill because it is an aspect of civil rather than criminal law, such expert backup should be available through the National Advisory Committee on Drugs.  The Garda must also be able to rely on the Forensic Science Laboratory or, if necessary, a private facility, although I am loath to agree to this.  If the forensic laboratory was properly resourced it would be able to deal with such things.  That is why I encourage the Minister to consider this again.  The problem is that we do not really have time to ask the Minister to consider this again because we have, at this stage, only 35 minutes left to discuss the Bill.  However, I ask him to consider in particular amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 9.I have tabled all these amendments with the aim of being helpful because, ultimately, everyone in the House has the same intention — to get rid of the scourge which is affecting many young people and also older people who should have more sense.  These people are clogging up accident and emergency units around the country, and the products being sold here have resulted in the deaths of a number of people, as has been attested to by a coroner recently in one particular case.

Obviously its expertise is and will continue to be used by the Department of Health and Children in banning substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  However, with regard to criminal prosecution, as the Deputy can see from section 3, proof is based on a certificate of analysis from a laboratory that shows the presence of a specific product.  The effects of substances on the people involved must obviously be proved by evidence, particularly from medical personnel.As new psychoactive substances are coming on the market on a daily basis from places as far away as China, we have included in the legislation provisions I feel will be used much more often, including the procedure under which the Garda may serve a prohibition notice which, if not complied with, can be the subject of a court order the breaching of which is a criminal offence.  The court can subsequently impose a closure order on a premises.  Having considered this, we believe these provisions, which are based on legislation in other areas, particularly that of food safety, will work properly.

I will be pressing some of these amendments because I believe there is a role for a regulatory authority, although I am willing to compromise in favour of giving some of these functions to the National Advisory Committee on Drugs.  As the Minister admitted, the committee is already doing work in this field and should probably be further resourced to ensure this work can continue.A prohibition notice can be served on a person, which could be somebody working behind the counter in a shop.  It is not specified that this should be the owner or manager of the shop or any other particular person.  Thus, the Garda might have to serve 20 or 30 notices before the shop eventually closes down.

In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:""National Advisory Committee on Drugs" or "NACD" is that which was established under the auspices of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in July 2000 and is now under the auspices of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs;".

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I move amendment No. 2a:In page 4, subsection (1), line 26, after "consumed" to insert "inhaled or ingested".This amendment applies to the definition of "psychoactive substance".  That definition would be amended by the insertion of both these amendments to read as follows: "psychoactive substance" means a substance, product, preparation, plant, fungus or natural organism which has, when consumed, inhaled or ingested by a person or applied to the body of any person" the capacity to produce certain effects as detailed in the subsection.  This is an appropriate amendment to make in the context of some of the products that are available, and I urge the Minister to accept it.  I do not propose to speak to the amendment at length because I am conscious of the limited time available to discuss the Bill.However, as I have not yet contributed, I wish to make a particular point.  In his contribution on Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendments, the Minister made reference to the bringing of criminal prosecutions and the making of prohibition orders under the Bill in regard to the products concerned, and to the possibility of making a closure order.  I wish to put down a marker in regard to an amendment we are unlikely to reach in the context of the products encompassed within this definition.  There is an urgent necessity to close down head shops in order to bring to an end the open sale of these products and to do it as swiftly as possible.  In that context, I am concerned about the procedure provided for in the Bill.  While Fine Gael fully supports the taking of criminal prosecutions and we can see to some extent the benefit of prohibition orders — although the provision contained in the Bill as drafted is defective in that area — it is our view that we should short-circuit the route provided in the Bill in order to allow the courts to make closure orders in respect of premises providing the psychoactive substances we are dealing with under the terms of this definition.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I am about to conclude.  I am concerned not only that will we not get an opportunity to discuss this issue in detail but that the definition of "psychoactive substance" is not as far-ranging as it should be, which is why we have proposed these amendments.  The central objective of this Bill should not only be to prosecute those who sell these substances that are so dangerous to vulnerable young people but also to close the shops in which they are sold.  I hope the Minister will indicate a willingness to take on board at least some of the Opposition amendments which we may not reach because the Bill is being foreclosed  by guillotine, particularly the amendment tabled to allow for the making of closure orders with swiftness by the courts in the terms proposed by Fine Gael.

I am aware of cases where methadrone, for example, is being injected by users causing horrendous abscesses.  I would be satisfied if the Minister could show that "consumed" covers all those eventualities, but for clarity of law, Deputy Shatter's amendments are reasonable and the Minister might also consider further amending the definition to include a reference to "injected".
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I am not always sure what one does with these products, but apparently extraordinary things can be done with them.  I am told that Deputy Shatter's proposed inclusion of "applied to the body of any person" and the reference to "ingested" are appropriate, so I am pleased to support the amendments.  This is the definitions sections and the definition of "psychoactive substance" is central to that; it is what the Bill is all about.The document that is somewhere in the Attorney General's office and which the Minister did not get to see raises a question that concerns me and which I have raised before.  In referring to the definition of "psychoactive substance" in the Bill, that document states:It is immediately apparent that the definition is extremely broad.  Of particular note is that it purports to define a psychoactive substance not by reference to any immediately identifiable characteristics but rather by reference to a capacity to cause certain effects.  In so far as the definition requires only that the substance have the capacity to produce the effects or responses thereafter, there is no further qualification as to the dosage or level of exposure that is required to cause the specified effect.This begs the question as to whether there is any substance which might not be regarded as having the capacity to produce one of the effects described on the human body.  I sincerely hope that the Minster's approach to this is beyond challenge or, if not, that it would be capable of resisting any challenge.  Since we have this definition for which the Minister has opted, the amendments from Deputy Shatter which refer to "ingest" or "rub on the body" are appropriate additions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I do not believe we are very far from each other in this regard because section 3 contains a definition of consumption which already explicitly includes orally, injecting and inhaling.  I am unsure how an addition elsewhere would add to what we have in place already.  My advice is that the amendment is unnecessary.I refer to the issue raised by Deputy Shatter concerning the closure order.  I noted the remarks of Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.  We examined closely what the Deputy suggested with regard to the closure order.  Indeed, we examined the matter before we published the Bill.  However, the strong advice of the Attorney General is that we must ensure we are compliant with matters of constitutionality related to interfering with someone's right to trade.  Therefore, the calibrated procedure of prohibition notice, prohibition order and, ultimately, a closure order is preferable.  In the interests of proportionality, due process and fair procedure, the strong advice from the Attorney General is that were we to proceed other than as suggested in the Bill the civil procedure could be open to challenge.  While I am inclined to agree with the procedure, I have been obliged to take the advice provided the Attorney General not only before the Bill was drafted but subsequently.  This is a point on which there was some discussion.  Obviously, we wish to have them closed down quickly.  I do not suggest they would not be closed down quickly otherwise.  I refer to the procedure of serving a prohibition notice, specifying a period, which could be a relatively short time, and going to court to get a prohibition order.  Any subsequent breach of that order and the possibility of a closure order is a matter for the court.  We believe this procedure and the way in which it is set out and calibrated in this way does not breach the constitutional rights of those involved and is as speedy as possible.

In the context of the definition, this is the only time we are going to get to discuss it.  I believe the amendment we propose is of some additional assistance in addressing the issue of being more specific as to the nature of the substance.  I was hoping the Minister would support it but I will not delay the House by putting it to a formal vote because I want us to move on.  As this is the only opportunity we will get to discuss this particular definition, like Deputy Rabbitte, I hope the advice the Minister is getting is correct.  I want this Bill to succeed.  I refer to the difference between the Minister and myself on the issue.  He mentioned a more calibrated approach as he goes through criminal prosecutions and prohibition orders.  I do not believe that approach will result in the closure of a single head shop this side of next Christmas.  That is the problem and it is something we must deal with more urgently.  I have urged the Minister to adopt the approach we have proposed.The font of all wisdom in these areas does not rest in the Attorney General's office.  There has been many a court case in which that has been established.  I hope the definition of psychoactive substance is linked into the definition of consumption in a way that works.  However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a reality with regard to the definition.  This is where I hold concerns about the broad nature of it, not as a consequence of any briefing I have had from the offices of Sheehan & Co. Solicitors or anyone else, because I have had no such briefing from them, but in the context of the definition.If we take the partial definition, "psychoactive substance" means a substance product or preparation that has the capacity to produce stimulation of the central nervous system or cause a state of dependence.  Could alcohol not fall within that definition?  Is that not the problem with that definition?  I point this out in the context of my hope that the legislation is successful in achieving the Minister's objective but I have a concern in the context of this definition that it is unduly broad and that there is a need to make it more specific.  In the short time we had available to us, we sought to do so by producing the amendment tabled.  I have a concern that the definition is too broad, that this will give rise to legal difficulties and that the legislation contains so many calibrated avenues and road maps to be travelled that it will not achieve the Minister's objective.  The objective should be to close down head shops that are selling products dangerous to young people.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	372	Deputy Shatter raised the issue about the definition of a psychoactive substance in section 1.  He maintains the reference to the capacity to produce stimulation or depression or to cause a state of dependence could include alcohol.  However, alcohol is specifically excluded in section 2(1)(c) which refers to intoxicating liquor within the meaning of section 77 of the Licensing Act 1872.  I suggest alcohol cannot be taken to be a psychoactive substance based on the legislation as drafted.I refer to what I have termed the calibrated response in respect of the civil procedure.  I am unsure whether I took up the Deputy's point correctly.  There are two aspects to this approach.  First, the criminal offence of selling a psychoactive substance and being reckless in respect of whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption.  The legislation indicates those involved shall be guilty of an offence.  Reference is also made to importation etc.  That is a criminal offence under the Bill.  Second, there is a civil procedure.  It is not the case that one begins with a criminal offence and then proceeds to a civil procedure.  The Deputy is probably aware of this but I make the point in case anyone examining the Deputy's last comments might believe the measures were based on a criminal conviction initially.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20932	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move:"That Dáil Éireann:notes with concern that:Ireland has suffered the longest and deepest recession of any Eurozone country because of reckless domestic management of the economy;investment, consumption, employment and living standards continued to decline in the first quarter of this year;the seasonally adjusted numbers of the live register rose by a further 5,800 in June and the actual number claiming now exceeds 450,000 for the first time ever;the Government plans to cut a further €14 billion from investment spending between 2011-2014 compared with the original commitments in the National Development Plan;the estimated taxpayer losses from the Government's banking strategy has reached €25 billion and is rising, even as it has failed to restore credit availability to industry; andmarket confidence in the Government's economic plan is declining, as evidenced by the rising gap between Irish and German borrowing costs;calls on the Government to:recognise that its economic plan is failing to undo the loss of international financial market confidence in Ireland;put jobs and industry growth at the centre of its economic strategy;review its banking strategy to limit the taxpayers' exposure and to focus resources on supporting new lending to viable businesses;delay further cuts to investment spending until employment starts to recover; andrestructure and re-capitalise the semi-State utilities in order to raise the necessary commercial funding to accelerate investments in water, high speed broadband and clean energy."I wish to share time with Deputies Perry, Clune, Sheahan and Bannon.Up to ten years ago, Ireland had an economic model that was the envy of the world based on high productivity growth, high export performance and sound public finances.  Employment was being created at a rate of 50,000 jobs per year and people rightly looked to Ireland's economy as a model for other countries to follow.  The sad truth is the model was destroyed in a few short years after we joined the eurozone.  It was destroyed by Governments that simply did not understand or take seriously their responsibility to protect that model when they were committing the Irish people to behave more like Germany in economic management as members of the eurozone rather than to behave according to the McCreevy approach of, "If I have it, I'll spend it".At a time like this we must examine what has happened to our economy.  Within two years our national income has declined by 28%.  No other economy has experienced such a decline.  Nothing like that has been witnessed anywhere in the world since the 1930s.  Investment has fallen by 101%, which is an unprecedented collapse.  Up until recently, the Taoiseach was telling us this was due to international factors, that no one could have predicted what was happening and that he was acting on best advice.  All that has been blown out of the water by two reports published by independent commentators — the Governor of the Central Bank and two experts from the IMF.  We now know this was an entirely home-made crisis and 75% of the decline was due to bad decisions at home.  From 2006 onwards it was not possible for Ireland to have, as the Central Bank and the Government wished to believe, a soft landing, yet as recently as May 2010 the Taoiseach was telling the people there would have been a soft landing if it had not been for the international crisis.The extent to which the Government had become out of touch with the economic realities is truly mind-boggling.  The toll of this crisis is to be found in the 300,000 people who have lost their jobs and 150,000 people who have emigrated over the past two years, not in economic statistics.  This tsunami on employment is affecting young people most of all with 90% of jobs lost by people under the age of 35 and 60% by people under 25.  They have carried the brunt of the employment collapse.  We would have looked to them to build our economic fortunes in the future.  They are well educated and they were bristling ideas as they left college.  If they are lucky now, they will be able to seek work overseas.  Many others have been caught in the property trap and they are in negative equity and struggling in the face of increasing threat to their jobs.Today's announcement with more information about the Government's banking policy rubs salt in the wound for people.  Many Members on this side of the House are not surprised to find that NAMA in its amended business plan has revised by 80% the projected profit it hoped to make.  It was to be €5 billion but now it is down to €1 billion, yet officials have only examined 20% of the loans it will take on.  They are saying their hoped-for profits from this operation will be down 80%.  What will this be like when the full extent of the loans is made known?Every month the Government parties come into the House looking for another €2 billion to put into Anglo Irish Bank.  They are projecting we may have to put €25 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, which will never lend again.  It is an unfathomable amount.  This is being done because the Government has insisted from the outset that the bank guarantee would be spread too wide and now the Governor of the Central Bank has confirmed that the guarantee was drawn up on a foolish basis.  It was too broad.  He acknowledged a guarantee was needed but, by including all the bondholders — people who were committed to and locked into the banks — the Government has imposed huge losses on the taxpayer.  We are seeing those huge losses in Anglo Irish Bank.  That is the consequence of what was done.While all the losses cannot be avoided, many of them could have been.  Having put €25 billion into failed banks that will never lend again, what are the Government parties doing about the 250,000 people in negative equity, those who are struggling to repay their mortgage and the 30,000 mortgage holders unable to repay?  They have almost nothing to say to all those who are on their knees struggling with this deep financial problem.  They are telling the banks they should not abuse the small group on tracker mortgages and they have said nothing about the solution.  There is no mention of examining equity swaps or write-downs over time or systems that will genuinely relieve the burden for these people.  The IMF is even telling us the banks are in a position to tackle this problem of certain of the most distressed loans but the Government does not recognise that.According to today's announcement, the taxpayer will be asked to put money more into the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which will go directly to the banks.  The taxpayer, therefore, is the only entity making a contribution to this problem that is not good enough.  That is not a response.  We will have to wait longer and there may be a response later in the year.  We look forward to the thinking that may come out of this process but the Minister of State can surely recognise the dramatic contrast between the Government's emergency response to the needs of investors in banks such as bondholders and subordinated bondholders to whom we have offered a total guarantee and those at the other end of the spectrum.  The same applies to its economic policy, which is all about repeating the two mistakes that got us into the crisis.One was pampering the banks and jumping to their every need to allow them to expand credit at a crazy pace.  The other was, as the text books describe it, procyclical budgets.  The Minister and the Department of Finance insisted on pouring fuel on an economy that was already overheating.  The solutions the Government tells us we must now follow are exactly the same.  There must be more procyclical budgets, although this time it is sucking the life out of an economy that is already on its knees, and we must continue to pander to the needs of the banks, which are themselves on the verge of insolvency in some cases.Surely Members on the Government side of the House must see that the policies that got us into this hole are not sufficient to get us out of it.  There must be a credible employment strategy if we are to confront this problem.  The core of our problem is the 300,000 people who are unemployed, most of whom are men.  Over 85% of the people who have lost their jobs are men, most of them young men.  If we do not respond to their problems, we will see a huge long-term unemployment problem scar our country again.  Consider the sectors from which these unemployed come.  Of these 200,000 males, 130,000 came from the construction sector while 40,000 come from the manufacturing sector.  A total of 170,000 have come from sectors where there is no immediate prospect of re-employment.  There must be an adequate response to this.  An employment strategy must surely be the core response, but that is not in the Government's thinking.There is scepticism about economic planning.  In the good times people such as Mr. Charlie McCreevy dismissed economic planning as public servants trying to poke their noses into areas where it would be better if they stayed out.  However, consider what that political culture created for us.  It created a situation where the Minister was spending money because he had it, encouraging banks to lend at breakneck speeds and the property bubble was being pumped up by tax credits.  What was happening in the real economy?  It was being destroyed.  Our competitiveness ranking fell from fifth to 22nd.  The cost of employment in this country, which had been low and was progressively improving, suddenly deteriorated by 25% against Germany and 35% against all our competitors.  Almost every indicator from the National Competitiveness Council moved into the amber or red zone.  It ranks 130 indicators and 75% are either in amber or red.  Why was there not a plan or joined-up thinking in the Government which acknowledged that if we want the type of economy that has been a success, that is, an export-led economy, competitiveness cannot go down the drain on every indicator, including the cost of electricity, waste, transport, rates and waste disposal?There was a need for coherent thinking but that was discarded by the political culture of that time.  It is not hard to understand how the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator proved unequal to confronting the arrogant swagger of these bankers, who thought they knew how to run the world and that they could walk on water.  The culture of the time was that these were the Titans.  They were the people one wanted to be close to so one could invite them to one's fund-raising functions; they were people to admire, as if they were creators of something worthwhile.  These were not great entrepreneurs creating enterprises that built business but people who dealt in speculative investments.  However, they became the titans of this country.  They were cosy in their relationship with the Government, and that filtered through to the Central Bank, whose Governor was always appointed from within the Government circle, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  It was an internal, cosy arrangement.At the root of that was a political culture that was simply flawed.  We have a political culture that must be broken down.  It is one which claims that the Dáil should not scrutinise budgets and that the Government knows best.  The Government will not set targets, will not accept scrutiny and will not offer alternatives.  It puts hacks on boards and will not let the Dáil scrutinise them or question whether they are competent.The scale of the employment crisis in this country demands a huge strategic response, which makes jobs the top priority.  We have a strategy to do that.  It is an innovative strategy which involves investing in the arteries of economic success, that is, electricity, broadband, water and other areas that will make us distinctive.  It means investing in those young people who will otherwise end up in Frankfurt, Sydney, London or New York and ensure we do not lose them.  It involves making bold strides in reforming our public service so we can deliver more with less.  That is the demand at present.What we are getting from the Government is a slow bicycle race that will not confront our problems.  It pretends everything can be solved by just shrinking our fiscal problems and solving the problems of the banks.  That alone will not work.  This debate is about acknowledging that we need a much broader strategy if we are to confront the scale of the crisis, and calling on the Government, at this late stage, to embrace that.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	377	This Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to put jobs at the centre of its economic strategy.  The reason the motion makes this call is that this Fianna Fáil Government has ignored the issue of job protection and new job creation.  In the past few years job losses have hit the small business and small manufacturing sectors particularly hard. Local jobs have been lost in every town and village throughout the country.  Small business is the lifeblood of local communities and this Government has ignored the plight of small, local, community based business.Last week's news from Insolvency Ireland made particularly difficult reading.  The report states that four Irish companies a day have gone out of business between January and June of this year.  The total came to 800 for the period.  The rate of failure was 27% higher than in 2009.  The report also identified that there has been a 174% increase in companies going into receivership.  Many of the companies listed in that report are small businesses, typically local community based building, services, hospitality and retail businesses.  The report shows that the number of companies unable to honour their debts has increased by 27% between January and June.Fine Gael strongly supports small business.  Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are the biggest employer in Ireland and are the backbone of local economies.  Much more must be done to create a business-friendly environment in terms of less regulation and access to funding.  While these businesses are started locally we must examine ways, for example, through the use of information technology, IT, to help SMEs to access new markets.  Research and development is also very important.  We must support the traditional industries that still employ large numbers of people.  The agriculture and agri-food sectors can still offer much in terms of exports, rural development and the development of local economies.  The innovation principle should also be applied to these sectors.All the indicators are that the small business sector is still in decline and the forecasts are that things will get even worse before they get better.  This is catastrophic for small community-based companies.  The Government has failed.  The immediate concern for many companies that are struggling to stay in business until the economy clearly turns the corner is the availability of credit.  There is an old saying in business, "cash is king".  This is especially true for a small business in the depths of a recession when cash income becomes scarce.  At present, there is no confidence and no credit in the economy.  One cannot do business when there is no confidence and no credit.The small business sector can do its part in bringing this country out of the present crisis through the creation of jobs at local level, but it can only do this if it gets the full and enthusiastic support of the Government.  The sector has been neglected by the Government for the past ten years.  Every household in Ireland depends on the sector in some shape or form, be it for goods, services or a job.  The Government can and must do something about this crisis.  I call on it to put real pressure on the banks to release credit to the small business sector.  The banks are sitting on piles of cash.  They are in receipt of millions of euro of taxpayers' money.  As Deputy Bruton said, billions have been put into a bankrupt bank, which is unbelievable.  The banks also have millions of euro from the lucky people who can save money.  All this money is sitting idle in bank accounts, doing nothing for the recovery of the economy and the creation of jobs.With the economic crash, consumer confidence has crashed as well.  Given the insecurity in the economy, those consumers who still have disposable income are now putting it all into savings.  However, they must ask themselves if it is wise to do this, where it earns a tiny interest, and if it is the best and most civic minded thing they can do.  We need to re-ignite the economy and consumers can play their part in economic recovery.  Consumer cash spending is the only significant way to get the cash back into local small businesses.  The first and immediate step to restoring the national economy must be to rebuild consumer confidence so domestic demand can lead off the recovery.  I am calling on the Government to initiate a simple, direct and immediate action by launching a campaign to encourage people to create jobs locally, to spend locally.I refer to the role of county enterprise boards and the opportunity for job creation in the retail sector.  There is a lack of confidence and cash.  People are completely dismayed to see €24 billion being put into a bankrupt bank, a bank which is literally closed for business.  I have yet to meet anyone who was given a loan by Anglo Irish Bank.  All it is doing is managing its accounts.  That bank is literally closed, bar putting a bolt on the door.  There is no cash, no job creation, no incentives.  Business people are given ten reasons not to create a job.  There is no encouragement for the creation of enterprise in the real economy.Opportunities for small companies are the backbone of this economy.  I refer to research and development, the business innovation units in the institutes of technology such as Sligo Institute of Technology and universities.  We must give a new sense of direction to entrepreneurs.  These are people with ideas.  We must encourage recent and young graduates to develop their entrepreneurial ideas.  The big companies are very important.  I believe that small acorns grow into great oaks.  We have to encourage enterprise at the beginning level.  It is regrettable that thousands of people are now leaving this country only because they have no job.  Parents are dismayed to see their well educated sons and daughters, educated at great expense, having no opportunities.A lot more should be done with regard to research and development in the innovation units at the institutes, colleges and universities to help business in the real economy.  The lack of cash is a serious problem.  One hears of 100 loans a day being approved by a bank but there are so many caveats and people are unable to draw down that money.  The banks are not doing their business.  We were told there would be a wall of cash for investment.  There is no wall of cash and no money.  The banks are shoring up their balance sheets and they are investing little or nothing in the economy.  I can assure the House that if Fine Gael gets the opportunity we will support small enterprise in every village and town because it is the backbone of this economy.  This Government has failed miserably in that area.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	378	Prior to last December's budget, the Fine Gael Party set out how we would approach the situation.  We acknowledged there would have to be some cuts in public expenditure and we acknowledged there would have to be some form of additional taxation but the targets and focus of our budgetary policy was fairer and more equitable and certainly did not take additional tax revenue from lower-paid workers, those earning less than €30,000 a year.  We certainly did not plan cuts in social welfare to the blind and to other vulnerable groups.  The key difference was that Fine Gael recognised the need to balance the cuts with the focus on job creation and jobs stimulus.  However, this has not happened.  We hear much talk of the need to get Ireland back working but where are the practical moves to ensure that this happens?  We all know that we are in a recession and that we have a deficit created by this Government and which is seriously out of control.  Approximately 25% to 50% of this deficit is related to employment or to unemployment.  The rate of unemployment is 13.5%, over 400,000 people.  This is the second highest rate in the EU.  It is a stark reminder of where we have come from.  When this Government came to power, the rate of unemployment was 4% and we had full employment.  However, things went rapidly downhill.  These figures should be referred to in tandem with the 100,000 or more who have emigrated in the past number of years, the many thousands now on upskilling training courses to ensure they improve their employment prospects.  Where are the jobs for the thousands of graduates, postgraduates, leaving certificate students, who have completed their studies last month?The Government will probably wave its smart economy plans, supplemented by the innovation task force report earlier this year.  This report has now been hived off to another review group to look at its recommendations and to analyse whether these can be implemented.  This kind of action is typical of the Government; endless reports but very little real action.  I refer to one of the key recommendations of the task force report which was to deliver on the investment framework set out in the strategy for science, technology and innovation 2006 to 2013 and achieve the goal in the renewed programme for Government of investing 3% of GDP in research and development.  That key recommendation seems already to have slipped, if we are to believe what is reported in today's newspapers that up to 600 research posts deemed to be key to the development of the smart economy, are to be lost this year.  These figures have been prepared for the Government by Science Foundation Ireland, the body charged with implementing the strategy.  We need to recognise that it is only by encouraging research to focus on the needs of industry and developing innovative ideas and ways of doing business and research that we can produce new products and processes.  Research will create employment and in turn, wealth, for this economy.The message from the Government is that the task force is just a case of another report which can be used as cover if the Government is asked about a plan.  I remind the House that it is not just this country asking questions because the EU has asked all member states about their expenditure in this area and how states intend to commit to their target spends.  The record will show a reduction in the spend in this area.  The wheels have come off the strategy for the science, technology and innovation wagon.Much needs to be done with regard to the education system which is not delivering the maths and science students needed for research and for financial institutions and to work in the financial services sector.  The task force report is littered with recommendations that need to be implemented.  We are not doing any favours to the students of today if we do not change our education system, if we do not teach students to be entrepreneurs, as mentioned by Deputy Perry.  We need to address the languages deficit in order to encourage call centres to set up here.  We are not providing the language graduates to work in those call centres.  We need to make changes to the education system.  We do not need another debate about whether Irish should be a requirement for the leaving certificate.  We need to have a debate about the quality of our education system and the way in which it needs to change in order to match the needs of industry in the future, which is the industry targeted by the Government in its strategy.I refer to an OECD report on innovation strategy.  It states that the global economy is to recover and move towards a sustainable growth path.  The traditional sources of growth are declining.  The current crisis has only served as a reminder of the need for innovation as a way to provide new solutions.  While expenditure cuts are needed and will be needed in the future, governments must continue to invest in future sources of growth such as education, infrastructure and research.  This Government has appointed a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and a junior Minister with responsibility for innovation.  Yet, there is a slipping in the expenditure in this area.It is essential the Government sends a clear, strong message that it is committed to the future of this economy and committed to future job creation and committed to delivering on the smart economy.  Mixed messages are being given out which will further undermine confidence in an already demoralised community.   We do not see a clear message from this Government.  I would like to touch on other areas but I state my complete support for the motion, which points out a better alternative.  The track the Government is following does not spell out confidence to me and the citizens of the country.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Many homemakers in this country would have made a better Minister for Finance than the current or the former Minister because they would have dealt with the issues of the day.  They would not have spent as Charlie McCreevy we did, where we have it we will spend it.  They would have put some aside.  Some 450,000 people are unemployed and 250,000 people are in negative equity.  Thousands of people are applying for the family income supplement.  Some €4 billion was taken from last year's budget and we believe €3 billion will be taken from this year's budget.  We will pay €1 billion in interest on NAMA and next year we will repay €1 billion to NAMA, costing the State €1 billion.  In 2012, NAMA will cost us €7 billion.  I put it to the Minister of State that the Minister for Finance is merely putting out fires as they flare up around him on a day-to-day basis.  In September 2008, the banks went into the office of the Minister for Finance and browbeat him into providing the cover they needed.  I believe they would not leave the room until they received assurances on the bank guarantee.  Banks have been doing likewise since.  The Taoiseach alluded to this today when it was made clear to him that all information that came from banks from that day to this has not been the whole truth or nothing but the truth.I refer to an article written in a small publication circulated in New Jersey.  The article refers to an Irish lesson and how the US can learn from economic mistakes.  It is based on the Irish economy.As Washington ponders the choice between (1) stimulative spending to juice up the economy and the job market and (2) budget cuts to reel in the national debt or some combination, there's a cautionary tale in the Irish experience.We took the latter course, budget cuts and tax increases.  The US took the former option with a massive stimulus package.  Hence, it has done well since.Almost two years ago, Dublin faced the same painful choice.  After a decade of growth that earned Ireland envy as "the Celtic tiger," the country's economy collapsed under the weight of an overheated housing market and lousy mortgages.  [This is familiar to both economies.]  The Irish didn't hesitate.  In a let's-get-this-over-with-quickly move, they slashed public spending and raised taxes, the standard recovery recipe of deficit hawks at the International Monetary Fund.  The result?  Even worse economic shrinkage.Earlier this week, Deputy Mattie McGrath said he believes the IMF will be in here before Christmas.  The Minister for Finance is reacting to the IMF.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach regularly come in here and tell us how well we have done and how we have been complimented by our European counterparts.The country's economy declined by slightly more than 7 percent last year, unemployment is now more than 13 percent.  Adding insult to injury, the world's investors, instead of rewarding Irish belt-tightening, have hiked the cost of Irish borrowing.  Their reason: a belief [Dáil Éireann's] spending cuts will actually retard growth and make it more difficult to pay down debt.We need stimulus and job creation.  Two thirds of the economy is based on consumer spending.  The longer we continue taking money out of people's pockets, the longer our recovery will take.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	380	Yesterday, The Irish Times summed up the ignorance of the Government on what we are facing and will continue to face under their mismanagement.  The article states: “Saying the recession is over runs the risk of fostering a cruel illusion that the economy is undergoing ‘a little technical adjustment’.”  Some technical hitch.  This is not a gentle breeze that will blow over in the morning; this is a fully fledged hurricane that will sweep away our homes and destroy businesses.  The means to cope with the emergency were not put in place and the repercussions that have ensued will not be ended lightly.  Lest we forget, given the speed at which events are moving, a recent report into the banking crisis states the Irish banking debacle was, in a cruel way, a home-made crisis.  This brings us to whose hand was involved in the home baking.  It was undoubtedly stirred by the former Minister for Finance, now Taoiseach, with some help from the current Minister.  What the Minister is misinterpreting, in his innocence, as an end to the recession is the natural recovery of a small part that follows the rapid fall of the economy.  It is in no way indicative of an improvement for those unemployed, facing unemployment or facing the prospect of losing their homes.  Unemployment has risen to 13.4%, which is a 16 year high and translates into 450,000 people unemployed.  A shocking statistic shows that four companies went out of business every day in the first six months of this year.  The human suffering associated with that figure is almost too much to take in.We are facing that suffering in Longford.  The potential closure of B3 Cable Solutions with, 100 jobs on the line, is a massive body blow to Longford.  It certainly gives lie to the Government's talk of the end of the recession.  Is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation aware of the alarming information I have been given that, despite the situation in Longford, B3 Cable Solutions has invested €4 million in Spain and purchased plants in Sweden, Germany and Manchester in our neighbouring country?I am extremely worried about the inactivity of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in response to the closure of this company.  I ask him to outline the steps he is taking to avert the closure in light of the company going into receivership with a mere six days remaining to sell it and prevent the loss of these jobs, which would be to the detriment of the socio-economic recovery of the region and to the future industrial and commercial profile of Longford town and the surrounding areas.  The Minister must put in place an urgently needed industrial strategy for Longford-Westmeath and the country.  The socio-economic implications for the recovery of the midlands necessitate urgent action on such a long-term plan.Fianna Fáil has allowed Longford to become an unemployment blackspot.  Deputies Kelly and O'Rourke have pulled down the shutters on the Longford-Westmeath constituency.  Longford-Westmeath currently has 16,000 people unemployed and Longford has got less than its fair share of State jobs.  This amounts to less than 2%.  The other bar to economic recovery is the high level of stealth taxes that deter investment and lead to existing companies relocating to China and the Middle East.  Taxes, insurance and energy charges are a major deterrent to investment and must be addressed by the Government.  The Minister and the local Government representative, Deputy Peter Kelly, must clarify the situation regarding the status of jobs at B3 Cable Solutions.  B3 Cables is a great company that has provided quality jobs in Longford all my lifetime and the current situation is a huge tragedy for the workforce.

At this time, an informed discussion regarding the Government's management of the economy is indeed relevant to dispel some of the myths put forward by those on the Opposition benches.  In my remarks this evening, I will outline how the policies adopted by the Government are beginning to bear fruit and in so doing I hope to dispel the negative sentiment contained in the Fine Gael motion.Last week, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published first quarter national accounts figures.  These data show that economic activity in Ireland, as measured by the internationally-accepted benchmark of gross domestic product, GDP, rose by 2.7% between the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.  This is the strongest rate of expansion of any country in the euro area.  The data do show gross national product contracting slightly, and this reflects the type of growth, but the figures nevertheless are welcome signs of growth returning to the economy.  Some commentators are now forecasting positive GDP growth for this year.  Moreover, the Department of Finance is considering its own forecast and is likely to issue a revised set of macroeconomic projections for this year shortly, as is customary in the month of July.  Consequently, the policies being implemented by this Government to improve competitiveness, maintain our public finances on a sustainable path and repair our banking system are having the desired effect.However, I wish to stress that the Government is not complacent and recognises fully the pain and suffering of many in our society who have been negatively affected by the economic difficulties experienced in the last three years.  While it is welcome that the economy has emerged from recession, let me be categorically clear when I state this is just the first step on the road to recovery.  Nevertheless, economic growth is an important first step as this is a crucial prerequisite for jobs growth and an improvement in living standards.  The Government will continue to address the economic, fiscal and banking issues over the coming years in the decisive and responsible manner that has characterised its management of the economy over the past couple of years in the face of an unprecedented crisis.Before discussing recent domestic developments, I wish to outline briefly some relevant international economic developments.  Of course, it is convenient for those on the Opposition benches and part of the media to view Ireland in isolation and to suggest that we are the only country that has experienced economic, fiscal and banking difficulties.  The reality could not be more different.  Almost all of the world's advanced economies have experienced very sharp falls in activity, giving rise to severe public finance problems and, in some cases, financial sector difficulties.  That said, I recognise fully that Ireland's problems are more severe than elsewhere.As a small and highly open economy, our prospects are inextricably linked to developments in the wider global economy and in this regard, the signs are reasonably good.  Most of our trading partners have emerged from recession and this will underpin an improvement in our exports,  as well as support inward investment.  However, on a more cautionary note, it also is fair to state that the recovery in some of our key markets, such as the euro area and the United Kingdom, is likely to be modest, at least in the short term.The confidence of global capital markets is another important feature of the international economy.  In April and May of this year, we all witnessed the fall-out from a loss of confidence by the international investment community in the ability of one European Union member state to implement sufficient fiscal consolidation policies.  These developments demonstrate, if demonstration was needed, the importance of continuing to pursue the necessary budgetary consolidation policies in Ireland.  In this regard, the Government's fiscal consolidation strategy has received widespread recognition and approval internationally.  As everyone in this House will be aware, between July 2008 and December 2009, five sets of consolidation measures already have been implemented. Broadly speaking, two thirds of the adjustments have been on the expenditure side with the remainder on the revenue side and this approach is in line with best practice.The measures are paying off.  This year the Government expects to stabilise the deficit and the figures published by the Department of Finance last week are consistent with this.  Aggregate tax receipts for the first half of the year are broadly on target, although income tax revenue is softer than planned and will be watched closely in the coming month.  Spending figures for the same period point to ongoing prudent control by Government and the expectation is that expenditure this year will be in line with and within previously set-out plans.  It also is worthwhile to note that, notwithstanding volatility on foreign sovereign debt markets, the NTMA has, at the mid-year point, raised more than 80% of the funding requirements for 2010, with the result that Ireland is in a comfortable position with regard to funding this year.  Moreover, even if we carried out no further borrowing this year, existing cash reserves would cover our borrowing requirements for the remainder of the year.  For next year, the Minister for Finance has stated that measures amounting to €3 billion will be implemented, with further measures being required in later years so that our deficit will be below Stability and Growth Pact requirements by 2014.  This approach has been endorsed by the European Commission and has been commended by other international bodies such as the IMF and the ECB.An improvement in global economic conditions, while undoubtedly welcome, is generally not sufficient for recovery in Ireland.  This is because we need to be in a position to be able to exploit the global improvement or in other words, we need to be competitive.  In this regard, there are grounds for optimism.  Consumer prices continue to decline, while those in our main export markets are now increasing.  This is helping to restore our price competitiveness.  In addition, I stress that falling prices are helping to support disposable incomes at a time when wages have come under pressure and when social welfare rates have declined.  In terms of cost competitiveness, data from the European Commission show that unit labour costs in Ireland are falling, in contrast to the increases being recorded in the rest of the euro area.  Recent exchange rate movements are also beneficial from a competitiveness perspective as the euro has depreciated against both the dollar and sterling.Hence, our competitiveness is improving and, combined with the improvement in the global economy, this bodes well for exports.  Indeed, the latest data show that exports performed well in the first quarter of the year and monthly data also point to a reasonable performance in the second quarter.  If we continue to make competitiveness adjustments, then we can expect export-led growth to gain momentum from now on.  I also point to the improvement in domestic confidence in recent months.  Consumers have become more confident and confidence in June reached its highest level since the end of 2007.  The decisive action taken by the Government to address the deterioration in the public finances has helped to create certainty and has generated more optimism.  As a result, consumers have started spending once again, especially on big-ticket items such as cars, assisted in part by targeted Government measures for this industry.The Opposition has sought political gain by criticising the Government for reductions in capital spending.  However, this is wide of the mark.  The allocation for this year is for capital spending of approximately 5% of national income.  By international standards, this level of investment is one of the highest in the developed world.  Moreover, it is clear that tender prices have fallen significantly in recent years and by 30% this year, according to some estimates.  I am highly conscious of this trend in the Office of Public Works.  This has enabled the taxpayer to gain greater value for money.  Thus, the Government, by keeping capital spending at relatively high levels, is providing a stimulus to the economy on the one hand, while ensuring better value for taxpayers' money on the other.There of course are those who believe that more should be spent on capital projects.  However, I stress that pursuing capital spending for its own sake is not appropriate budgetary planning.  Projects must be assessed on their own merits, having regard to both costs and benefits and the capital programme covering the period 2010 to 2016 is appropriate and involves spending €5.5 billion each year from 2011.  This programme will assist our future growth potential.I now turn to the issue of the labour market.  The Government is acutely aware that the greatest fall-out from our economic difficulties is in the labour market.  After adjustment for seasonal factors there were 445,000 people on the live register in June, a figure which is far too high.  However, we will not be able to reduce unemployment until we can secure robust economic growth and that is what the Government is doing through our competitiveness, fiscal and banking sector policies.  Contrary to the Opposition view, jobs are the key focus of this Government.  However, in the real world where policies are formulated and implemented, it is clear to all, except apparently the Opposition, that employment growth cannot be achieved without economic growth and that economic growth cannot be achieved without improvements in competitiveness, a sustainable public finance position and a functioning banking sector capable of providing funding to viable projects.The Government's entire economic strategy is about sustaining and creating jobs, as set out in its framework for economic renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  It is repositioning Ireland as a global innovation hub, that is, the best place for both multinational and Irish companies to start, grow and transform.  That will lay the foundations for future employment growth.  We are developing opportunities in the green economy, renewable energy and clean technology.Finally, I wish to turn to the banking system which has also absorbed much of our time and energy in recent years.  A healthy, fully operational banking system is a cornerstone of any modern economy so it is clear that restoring confidence and repairing the system is a prerequisite for economic recovery.  That is why the Government, like governments and central banks across the globe, has provided substantial support to the financial sector.  The main policy initiatives have been the bank guarantee in order to secure the liquidity of the banking system, the establishment of NAMA in order to clear up the balance sheets of banks, the recapitalisation of banks and restructuring of the banking system and reform of the regulatory system.The Government is determined to put in place the necessary mechanisms to ensure that viable firms and enterprises have access to credit.  In this regard, the Government has required AIB and Bank of Ireland to submit SME lending plans to the Department of Finance detailing how they propose making the €3 billion available to SMEs.  These plans have been reviewed by Mr. Trethowan, the credit reviewer, and he considers that both are credible programmes to achieve the lending targets.In addition, the Credit Review Office was established by statutory instrument under the NAMA legislation to ensure that banks continue lending to viable businesses.  The office reviews refusals by banks to grant credit, including reductions and withdrawals of credit.  The borrower must first invoke the internal appeals procedure in the bank.  Mr. Trethowan, the credit reviewer, has worked with the banks to ensure that their internal appeals systems are placed on a more formal footing.  Although the number of reviews is quite low as yet, it is expected to increase as people become more aware of the existence of the Credit Review Office and their right to review.  In this context, I would encourage any SME or farm enterprise which is refused credit to contact the office to get advice on how to proceed.As the economy starts to improve, there will be increased demand for working capital as business activity and stock levels rise.  The Government expects the banks to play their part by supplying credit to viable businesses to allow them to participate in and contribute to the improvements in the economy.  The Government has ensured that the banks have the necessary capital to be in a position to meet the increased demand for credit.  It is up to the banks now to make this credit available to viable businesses and their performance will be monitored by the Credit Review Office to ensure that they do so.In terms of regulatory reform, the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010, which is being debated in the Seanad this evening, is a crucial step in a comprehensive programme to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services that meets the Government's objective of maintaining the stability of the financial system.  It provides for the effective and efficient supervision of financial institutions and markets and safeguards the interests of consumers and investors.This is the first of a three-stage legislative process to create a new fully integrated structure for financial regulation.  It provides a statutory basis for the new structure, which will replace the existing Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.The Government has reacted decisively and in a timely manner to address the rapid change in our economic fortunes.  That is widely recognised internationally by those who objectively assess our performance.  Hard decisions have been taken and these have helped to reposition the economy on a more sustainable, export-led growth path.  Those hard decisions are now beginning to bear fruit, as evidenced by the return to growth in the first quarter.  While that has not yet had a positive impact on the labour market, as the recovery gains momentum we can expect further dividends, including in the labour market.In the couple of minutes remaining to me I wish to reply to a couple of points made by Deputy Sheahan.  It is often quoted and I must admit I do not approve of the remark myself — we have it so we will spend it — but that did not describe Deputy McCreevy's actual policy as opposed to perhaps his rhetoric.  He reduced the national debt and put a great deal of money into the NTMA, which has been indispensable in the recent past, and introduced measures to encourage personal savings.  That needs to be borne in mind.Deputy Sheahan quoted a New Jersey newspaper.  We all know that US economic policy is to encourage other countries to continue with stimulatory packages, presumably because that will help the US economy, but one cannot simply equate what might be appropriate for the US economy, which is the world's largest economy, with the Irish economy and to assume that what fits the one will fit the other.  I have often expressed the view that we do not have the funds to have a net stimulus which would increase borrowing.  I am interested that the new Fine Gael spokesperson for finance, Deputy Noonan, whom I wish well, and who has a considerable reputation, is going to look again at party policy in that regard.  I do not think a policy which requires an early increase in indebtedness is viable in the current context.

I was also pleased to hear the news about Deputy Perry.  He is another man whose work I admire.  I wish him well with his new responsibilities.As Bill Clinton often said, "It's the economy, stupid."  This debate focuses on that.  Even though we were told a week ago that the recession is over, which I hope is the case, it is clear as we go around communities that people need to see evidence of that.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware that there was bad news for my constituency tonight with the announcement that the Citywest complex has gone into receivership.  It is not in my constituency of Dublin South-West, it is adjacent to it in Saggart, but nevertheless, the announcement in that regard will shock the constituency.  I note a receiver has been appointed.  I hope he will focus on preserving and protecting the jobs at the complex.  Even though the complex is not physically in my constituency it is an issue about which I feel strongly.  We are all aware that it is one of the biggest hotels in Europe.  Hundreds of people are employed in the complex, many of whom are from my base in Tallaght.  I am very concerned about them.  From speaking to a number of them this evening I know they are shocked.It is important that the receiver understands the challenge the situation presents for him.  I hope he keeps to his word.  I understand he has made a statement to the effect that the hotel complex will be open for business as a growing concern, which is very important.  I took the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Taoiseach, as busy as he was.  I am pleased to say he was not so distracted that he did not listen to my concerns.  I had a conversation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who is on important business with other colleagues in Limerick tonight.  I mentioned my deep concern about the situation.  I was pleased to hear assurances from him that he will liaise with the receiver and hotel management and do what he can to preserve those jobs.  It is important to make that point during the debate.There has been much media coverage in the past 48 hours and especially today about events going on in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms as we speak.  My two colleagues across the Chamber will understand that these things do happen in party rooms.  Someone asked me today whether I had learned anything from the recent events in the Fine Gael Party rooms.  I said I did not know what went on so I did not learn anything.  However, it did give me an opportunity to say to media contacts who contacted me today that my focus is not on personalities, it is on the issues that are of concern.As I go about my business in my constituency and in the Dublin region, people talk to me of the issues of deep concern to them.  They talk about the economy, jobs, the need to protect funding for community projects, education and the need to protect the vulnerable, as Fianna Fáil has always done.  Political points can be made on this but it is important that we continue to speak up.I am sometimes taunted, albeit not seriously, by those on the Opposition benches about the role of Government backbenchers.  However, I believe very strongly my role is to stay on the ground in my constituency, come to the House, talk to Ministers and get my point across regarding what should be done.  I have very clear views on what should be done.  It is a question of jobs.  Any discussion on the economy in this recession must focus on jobs.  I have told all Members, and always without fear, that I am able to bring to my politics my life experiences.  These include having been made redundant three times and having to struggle with this.  It is "about the economy, stupid" and about getting the message across.  I will certainly continue to do that.There have been various reactions to the Government's press conference today on the report on mortgage arrears.  It was attended by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív.  I am sure colleagues from the Labour and Fine Gael benches will take the opportunity during this debate, as they did during Question Time, to voice their views on mortgage arrears.  The recommendations in the report comprise good work and are certainly a start.My colleague Deputy Thomas Byrne, who is to speak on this debate, was a cosignatory, along with me and Deputies Tom Kitt, Chris Andrews and Cyprian Brady, to a motion tabled for our parliamentary party asking the Government to do something about this issue.  We framed it some weeks ago.  As I mentioned in the House recently, I took the opportunity to bring the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, to Fettercairn in Tallaght to hear 60 community leaders express their views on Government policy on all the issues that have arisen in this debate.  I am glad they took the opportunity to do so and that the Minister listened.The subject of today's report arose at recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, chaired by Deputy Healy-Rae and which has included Opposition spokespersons Deputies Shortall and Enright.  I do not want to patronise again but Deputy Michael Ring will not mind my saying he will do a great job and that Deputy Enright has done a superb job as Opposition spokesperson.  The members of the committee have been very responsible and have worked well together.  It considered the issue of the new poor, who include those suffering over mortgage repayments and who, a year or six months ago, were comfortable and had jobs.  I hope the report today will result in some respite for these people and help them through difficulties.I fully support the recommendations in the report.  The time has long since come for all the banks, which are being supported by the taxpayer, to show compassion for those in difficulties.  I was glad to hear that the chairman of the Irish expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt, Mr. Hugh Cooney, has made it clear he wants improved communications and consistent policies applied by lenders to borrowers.  He is encouraging all lenders to take immediate steps to implement the recommendations that relate to them.  I hope they do so without delay.As with other colleagues, I have been receiving calls throughout the week from people concerned about their jobs.  They include those working in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, not only in the Tallaght branches but also in those throughout my constituency and the Dublin region.  I am quite sure all Members have been contacted in this regard.  It is important that we echo what Deputy Batt O'Keeffe stated on the record, namely, that this matter is of great concern.  At a time of serious unemployment in the State, I will put up my hand in the Fianna Fáil benches and say my constituency has suffered as much as any.  There are more than 10,500 people unemployed in the Tallaght region, signing off at its social welfare office.  This concerns me greatly.  I know what redundancy is like and what it is like for the families affected.  I understand what it is like to have to go home to tell one's family that circumstances will be even more difficult than they are.It is important to express these views to the Government.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, will convey to the Ministers that these issues are of concern to us all.  The concern and upset is not confined to those on the Fine Gael or Labour benches, although they take the opportunity regularly to articulate it very strongly.  It is important that one understands that those of us working on the ground listening to people want to express the view I am expressing.  I am not afraid to express it.How much time have I remaining?

Differences will be expressed but that is fair enough.  The amendment makes it very clear that the Government feels very strongly about employment and the restoration of confidence in the economy.  I hope that will continue to be the case.Confidence has increased.  The Government amendment makes the point that we are all spending money again, including on cars.  As one travels around Dublin, one notices quite a bit of activity in this regard, not least because of the scrappage scheme introduced in the Dáil last year, which was supported across the floor.  My colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Seán Connick, had strong views on it.  I hope my singling him out does not upset anybody else from Wexford.  I know it will not upset the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  From contact with garages in my constituencies, I know they were very pleased about the scrappage scheme.  It has led to increased sales and is very important.Private Members' business is very important because it gives us all an opportunity to make a contribution on current issues.  It is sometimes unfortunate that we must divide on it.  I am sure the Fine Gael spokespersons will be very clear tomorrow night that their views differ from those of the Government.  A very positive message must be sent out from the Oireachtas that this motion is a question of the economy, restoring confidence in communities, creating jobs, getting people back to work and encouraging investment.  I hope we will all continue to contribute to achieving these goals.

This afternoon saw the formal publication in the Dáil of the revised NAMA business plan.  In the context of this Fine Gael motion on the economy, the NAMA business plan is appalling news for taxpayers.  It shows that, in the nine months since the draft business plan was published, the people in NAMA have revised their estimate of it making a profit of €4.8 billion over its life to a worst case scenario of losses of €800 million, a turnaround in nine months of more than €5 billion in extra losses.  Clearly, the first NAMA draft plan was a fantasy.  It is difficult to believe the revised plan except in so far as it means more pain and no gain for taxpayers.While NAMA has transferred large bad assets from banks to the taxpayer, the banks, which have been the recipients of this largesse, are still effectively closed for credit.  We have a credit famine for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and indigenous businesses that rely on the guaranteed banks.  This alone is continuing to cost tens of thousands of jobs as small businesses yield to the inevitable and close up shop or reduce their employee numbers.  Other SMEs never get off the starting blocks.Today's business plan again confirms that Fianna Fáil in Government remains mesmerised by the banks and the developers and simply cannot turn its gaze or attention to the real economy, employment, job retention and job growth.  Even in the best case scenario where NAMA recovers the long-term economic value of the assets plus 10%, the revised profit figure would be €3.9 billion, a drop of €1 billion.  This scenario B, as set out in the plan, requires NAMA's assets to rise in value from their takeover values to 21%, representing 11% of an uplift plus 10% over the so-called long-term economic value.  This is a highly unlikely scenario.The business plan makes it clear that NAMA is definitely an asset management company and not a bad bank.  Assets with a value of €81 billion are being acquired from the eligible institutions, those being, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  Nine months ago, we were going to acquire assets worth only €77 billion.  The House must bear in mind that we are taking no assets valued at less than €5 million, which will stay with the banks.  Every scenario that this wretched Government comes up with regarding our economy is much worse than even it could have forecast.  One might call it bad luck for the Taoiseach, but such a deterioration in a nine-month period is unbelievable.According to a note on the first page of the new draft business plan, the State is to acquire derivate transactions with a nominal value of more than €14 billion.  When I asked about these during the debate on NAMA, I was told not to worry my little head about them and that everything would be fine.  We are now being told that a substantial number of these derivatives are non-performing and underwater.  We are also told that NAMA will pay nil consideration for them.  We will get non-performing derivatives for nothing, but what we do not know is what cost implications they and other acquired derivatives will have for taxpayers.  That information does not even figure in the plan.Almost everything about this plan is worse than was forecast.  Far from NAMA loans "washing their face", as claimed by the Minister and his economic adviser in the debate, taxpayers will be left wiping egg off their faces from this rotten deal, which aims to bail out bankers and developers.  We were told over and over that the good assets being transferred into NAMA would yield significant returns.  When the bundle went to NAMA, there were to be good and bad assets.  Some would be underwater, but others would be earning their keep.  Today's report confirms that, at most, only 24% of loans are generating any income, that is, repayments or interest payments.  In this climate, loans that are generating neither capital repayments nor interest payments are goners.  This is reflected in the fact that some of the NAMA good assets were, for example, shopping centres.  Retailers cannot pay the fantasy rents — based on upward-only rent reviews — that the developers want to charge for the banks in order to keep the property value of their non-performing shopping centres up for the purposes of NAMA.  This is an exercise in smoke and mirrors and the only people being taken to the cleaners are ordinary citizens and taxpayers.It is not clear what the floating rate on the NAMA bonds will be.  One of the key assumptions used was that this would be at a low level, which was always likely to prove to be a fantasy in the long run.  The European Central Bank, ECB, has set interest rates at an historically low level in order to pump money into real economies.  We are pumping money into NAMA, the exact purpose for which the ECB's low interest stimulus package is not meant.NAMA is coming in with expected administration costs, slightly behind those outlined in the draft business plan.  This is about the only positive in what is a deeply depressing business plan.  As a consequence of the plan and the extra €5 billion in losses to be loaded onto the taxpayer, the Government is redrawing the national development plan.  Key road and rail projects are to be axed as the money for them runs out because we are transferring that money to NAMA.  Technically, NAMA's debt burden is off the balance sheet, but it is on all of our shoulders.  As a consequence, an extensive list of more than 30 road projects, not to mention Luas and metro projects, will not proceed.  In September, little children starting school will pass through school gates.  Although they will be skipping along, their parents might not be skipping behind them.  If parents have problems repaying their mortgages, there will be no NAMA for them.  There is not even an extension from one year to two years in the work-out period for mortgages in difficulty.  Doing this would not be difficult, as it is only a framework to give people two years to try to recover their jobs and family incomes.  However, it was not even mentioned in today's report.To what do the boys and the girls walking into school together, aged four and a half or five and a half years, have to look forward?  Their new schools will not be built.  The roads from the motorway to their houses will not be improved.  Most of all they will grow up burdened by the extraordinary level of debt the Government has placed not just on this generation, but on their one as they head to school next September.  It is high time that this Administration left office and handed over to a new Government.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I thank Deputy Burton and the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Fine Gael motion.  When I started to read the document, I thought it was very good stuff and wondered whether a coalition might be possible, since I would not have thought so previously.  A special delegate conference of our people would have been completely hostile to it.  However, on reading the first seven or eight bullet points, I believed the motion was going exceptionally well. "Ireland has suffered the longest and deepest recession of any eurozone country because of reckless domestic management of the economy" was 100%  right and all of the bullet points were flagging valid issues, such as the Government "failing to recognise that its economic plan is failing to undo the loss of international financial market confidence in Ireland".  Of course that is correct, but then the very last one tripped me, referring to "restructure and re-capitalise the semi-State utilities in order to raise the necessary commercial funding to accelerate investments in water, high speed broadband and clean energy".I totally support the concept of raising funds for improving clean water and ensuring that it is available for our people, that there is high speed broadband and, of course, clean energy.  Where I disagree with Fine Gael is that I do not agree we should be selling off the State agencies, which it proposes revamping for this purpose, in order to fund that critical infrastructure.  There are other ways, which we set out most recently in our pre-budget submission in December 2009 in preparation for budget 2010.  We believe it is fundamentally important that the State maintains its critical infrastructure and its State services, such as, for example, the ESB.  It makes an annual return to the Exchequer which is very healthy and it is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  Why on earth would one consider privatising the ESB?  Another example is the social service role of An Post, aside altogether from the public service it provides.  The Minister of State is a rural Deputy, as are Deputy Perry and I, and we really value the service An Post delivers.  Privatising it would be an enormous additional burden on the people not just in financial, but also in social terms.  Whatever short-term economic gain might be achieved through selling services such as this would be very short-sighted indeed.Take the CIE group of companies.  I have no problem with private enterprise standing toe to toe with CIE in relation to public transport and transport generally.  However, we cannot have fair weather operators.  If we want to provide sustainable public transport, it needs to be what it says on the tin, sustainable, public transport offering a service to our people.  Sometimes that means elements of that transport operating at cost.  Hopefully, the elements which are particularly profitable will sustain that but I have no problem with toe to toe stuff or competition in that regard.  We have been through this before in relation to the whole banking crisis.If we had in place a properly run State bank, it would not have got involved in the whacky race to the bottom which occurred in the commercial sector.  I am not saying we should in any way diminish the commercial sector.  All we should do is govern it in such a way that it is practical and functions, so that it cannot get away with the carry-on in which it was engaged.  I am talking about loans circulating to the golden circle, without any guarantees whatsoever, and loans washing in and out of various banks as their AGMs approached.  It beggars belief that such carry-on could have happened in this State.  Then, of course, there was the whole issue of the auditors.  Where were the auditors in these companies because, after all, they are corporate entities?  They were obliged to submit audit reports and they did.  Those auditors were totally blind in relation to activities in the banks.  Some of them ended up working for NAMA.  Rather than being turfed out and never getting work with anything to do with the State again, they have been rewarded and are helping NAMA to value loans.  Is this something we should be tolerating?  We are a very passive society.However, I shall return to the economy because that is the essence of this motion.  I was amused by the Minister of State earlier when he said the policies being implemented by the Government were "having the desired effect".  The desired effect is, obviously, to squeeze every last cent out of the economy to ensure that the people who spend money are being hammered, such those on low incomes and the welfare dependent, who spend all their money on groceries and bits and pieces — this goes directly into the economy, creating the necessary dynamism.  The joke of it all this week is the Government claiming we are out of recession.  I thought the Minister for Finance would have been quiet on this "the recession is over" bit.  I accept it is a technical manifestation as to how recession is measured or otherwise but just talk to any single one of the 450,000 on the live register and ask them if the recession is over.  Ask the thousands of small business people who struggle from day to day to try to keep their businesses going because they have lost their customer base.  With that has gone their cash flow.A small business will try to organise an overdraft to keep going and keep as many people employed as possible.  The banks, however, respond with their shutters down, "no deal", and will not lend money.  The Irish Banking Federation representatives came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment this afternoon.  They were telling us that loans were flying and they were looking after small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, indigenous business, etc.  I had to remind them fairly forcefully that the people I meet on a daily basis, the small businesses who are keeping the economy going, have no trust or belief whatsoever in the banking sector, yet the Government is allowing them to get away with it.  If the Government had nationalised the two big associated banks, in particular, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, rather than telling lies to the Department of Finance, and various Oireachtas committees such as the enterprise committee, the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs and others, we could have cut to the chase.  The Government could have got its hands on the levers of these banks and made sure there was a proper funding stream going to small and medium-sized enterprises, so they were not depending on the lackeys in the banks.NAMA admitted to the finance committee just three weeks ago that the banks were still not coming clean, even at this late stage in the game.  NAMA has told us it is going to get quite cross with the banks because it is fed up with how they are behaving.  In terms of whether the country is "out of recession", talk to people in any of the constituencies involved in this House and ask them.  I do not know whether that is meant to be humorous or if it is just encouraging people to be scornful of the whole setup of politics here.  Certainly, I believe politics has got a bad name, particularly on foot of what the Government policies have been, to bail out the bankers and speculators.  We are letting down all those unfortunate people who cannot meet their mortgage repayments through no fault of their own, because they have been made unemployed.  Just this afternoon we learn that the Minister for Social Protection is increasing the mortgage interest relief to banks.  That will not gain one red cent for their poor unfortunates in their homes, but it will put extra taxpayers' money into the coffers of the banks, and that is scandalous.Government policy on having multinational companies as almost its entire centre of focus has been totally misguided.  It is time that the State recognised the role of the small business person, the entrepreneur, and turned this around to give some type of credence to job retention and job creation in that sector, which affords the vast amount of employment in the State.  It is time it was offered some type of additionality in terms of support for the services it is offering.  Those small businesses are the backbone of the economy, and will continue to be, but only if the Government gives them adequate support.

Is Bille an-ghairid é seo a bhfuil sé de chuspóir aige an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú ó chúig bliana go leith go dtí seacht mbliana go leith.  Tá glactha leis an mBille seo ag gach céim i Seanad Éireann cheana féin.Eascraíonn an leasú seo as cinneadh atá déanta ag an Rialtas na toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur siar ar feadh tréimhse áirithe.  De réir na reachtaíochta faoina bhfeidhmíonn an t-údarás i láthair na huaire, ní mór na toghcháin a reáchtáil taobh istigh de thréimhsí nach giorra ná ceithre bliana agus nach faide ná cúig bliana go leith ó dháta na dtoghchán deiridh.  Reáchtáladh toghcháin deiridh an údaráis ar 2 Aibreán 2005 agus ba chóir, dá bhrí sin, an chéad toghchán eile a reáchtáil roimh 1 Deireadh Fómhair 2010.  Níl aon fhoráil sa reachtaíocht chun na toghcháin a chur siar.I láthair na huaire, tá leasuithe maidir le cumhachtaí, feidhmeanna agus struchtúr Údarás na Gaeltachta sa todhchaí á meas i gcomhthéacs na moltaí atá sa dréacht-straitéis 20-bliain don Ghaeilge.  Tá an dréacht-straitéis á scrúdú ag an Chomhchoiste um Ghnóthaí Ealaíon, Spóirt, Turasóireachta, Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta faoi láthair.  Nuair a bheidh a chuid oibre curtha i gcrích ag an gcomhchoiste — agus tuigtear dom go bhfuil sé beagnach curtha i gcrích — cuirfear an dréachtstraitéis ar ais faoi mo bhráid.  Déanfar moltaí éagsúla an chomhchoiste a bhriethniú go cúramach sula gcuirfear faoi bhráid an Rialtais ina dhiaidh sin iad.  Mar a thuigfidh an Teach, ní féidir liom amscála cruinn a thabhairt don phróiseas seo, ach tá mé dóchasach go mbeidh dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ina leith sa chéad chúpla mí eile amach romhainn.Mar a rinne mé sa Seanad coicís ó shin, ba mhaith liom an deis seo a thapú le mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do bhaill an  chomhchoiste as an méid oibre atá á dhéanamh acu ar an dréachtstraitéis.  Is mór agam go bhfuilimid, mar Bhaill den Oireachtas, ag déileáil leis an dréachtstraitéis ar bhonn tras-pháirtí.  Léiríonn an cur chuige seo go soiléir nach mbaineann ár dteanga náisiúnta le haon dream nó páirtí ar leith ach gur gné an-tábhachtach í dár bhféiniúlacht agus dár n-oidhreacht choitianta.  Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann leanúint ar aghaidh leis an gcomhoibriú tairbheach seo chun toradh fónta a bhaint amach ar mhaithe le leas na teanga agus leas phobal na tire araon.Ag eascairt ó mholtaí éagsúla atá sa dréachtstraitéis i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta, meastar go mbeidh gá le leasú níos cuimsithí a dhéanamh ar reachtaíocht an údaráis a thógfaidh tréimhse áirithe ama lena chur i gcrích.  Tá gach cosúlacht ann go mbeidh reachtaíocht le tionscnamh chomh maith le teorainneacha nua a shainiú do na limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Sa chomhthéacs seo tá sé inmholta agus cuí dáta na dtoghchán a chur siar chun deis a thabhairt an próiseas seo a chríochnú.Go hachomair, is é an leasú atá molta sa Bhille seo ná alt 28(1) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 a leasú ionas go mbeidh síneadh curtha leis an tréimhse is faide idir thoghcháin don Údarás ó chúig bliana go leith go dtí seacht mbliana go leith.  Le hachtú an Bhille seo, is é 30 Meán Fómhair 2012 an dáta deiridh i gcomhair toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a reáchtáil.Agus an Bille seo á thionscnamh agam, is fiú tagairt a dhéanamh don chomhthéacs ghinearálta ina bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú faoi láthair.  Bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta i 1980 faoin Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 agus tá sé á mhaoiniú ag an Rialtas ó shin i leith chun forbairt eacnamaíochta, shóisialta agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé mar mhóraidhm ag an Údarás an Ghaeilge a chothú mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht.  Chun a chuid aidhmeanna a chur i gcrích tacaíonn an t-údarás le réimse de scéimeanna tairgiúla fostaíochta a dhíríonn ar leas a bhaint as acmhainní áitiúla, ar scileanna agus ar chumais fhiontraíochta a fhorbairt, ar infheistíocht shoghluaiste a mhealladh agus ar an fhorbairt phobail a threisiú.  Tacaíonn an t-údarás freisin le réimse leathan de thionscnaimh theanga, chultúrtha agus oideachais.Tá 20 comhalta ar bhord an údaráis, 17 acu tofa go daonlathach ag toghthóirí na Gaeltachta agus triúr eile, an cathaoirleach san áireamh, a cheapann an tAire.  Tá foireann de thart ar 100 duine fostaithe ag an údarás, a bhfuil gréasáin d'oifigí réigiúnacha aige sna ceantair Ghaeltachta éagsúla chun a chuid dualgas reachtúla a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ag deireadh na bliana 2009, bhí os cionn 8,000 duine fostaithe i gcliant-chuideachtaí a fuair tacaíocht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Léiríonn an t-athbhreithniú ar Údarás na Gaeltachta atá déanta mar chuid den Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact don tréimhse 2000 go 2008 gur baineadh torthaí mar seo a leanas amach d'eacnamaíocht na Gaeltactha trí ghníomhaíochtaí forbartha tionscail an údaráis: sa bhliain 2008, bhí díolacháin de luach €834 ag cliaint-chuideachtaí an údaráis a ghlac páirt sa suirbhé; bhí 6,500 duine fostaithe sna comhlachtaí seo; b'fhiú  €400 milliún onnmhairithe na gcuideachtaí seo in 2008.  Tháinig méadú mór ar an líon daoine a bhí ag obair san earnáil taighde agus forbairt idir 2005 agus 2008.  Faoin mbliain 2008, bhí 300 fostaithe ag comhlachtaí san earnáil seo.Is eagras forbartha réigiúnach é an t-údarás a bhfuil ról tábhachtach á chomhlíonadh aige maidir le polasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a chur i bhfeidhm.Cuimsíonn an reachtaíocht faoina bhfeidhmíonn Údarás na Gaeltachta na hAchtanna um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 go 1999.  Is fiú dhá cheann díobh sin a lua ach go háirithe, An tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 1999 a mheádaigh an tréimhse idir thoghcháin ó chúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí agus a léiríonn an fasach atá ann don chur chuige atá i gceist leis an mBille seo, agus An tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) (Uimh. 2) 1999 a chuir athruithe substaintiúla i bhfeidhm ar struchtúr Údarás na Gaeltachta tríd an líon comhaltaí a mhéadú ó 13 go 20.Tá sé tráthúil ag an phointe seo léargas a thabhairt ar pholasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Ainneoin na géadta bliain d'aistriú teanga ó Ghaeilge go Béarla, tá an Ghaeilge á labhairt go fóill mar theanga bheo pobail i roinnt áiteanna a d'fhan ina nGaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis seo, tá cuid mhaith daoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ag úsáid na Gaeilge go laethúil.  Tá bláthú tagtha ar litríocht agus ar chineálacha eile ealaíon trí mheán na Gaeilge le 100 bliain anuas sa chaoi is gur teanga iomlán nua-aimseartha Eorpach í an Ghaeilge anois.Tá sé mar aidhmeanna polasaí ag an Rialtas úsáid na Gaeilge a mhéadú mar theanga an phobail ar bhonn céimniúil agus a chinntiú go bhfuil an oiread saoránach agus is féidir dátheangach i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.  Tá na spriocanna seo a leanas ábharthach don bpolasaí seo: cur leis an méid teaghlach ar fud na tíre a bhaineann úsáid as an nGaeilge mar theanga cumarsáide laethúil; tacaíocht teanga a sholáthar don Ghaeltacht mar phobal labhartha Gaeilge; cinntiú chomh fada agus is féidir go mbeidh rogha teanga idir an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla ag an saoránach i ndioscúrsa poiblí agus i seirbhísí poiblí agus de réir a chéile go ndéanfaidh níos mó daoine ar fud an Stáit cinneadh a ngnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge; agus cinntiú go mbeidh an Ghaeilge níos infheicthe sa tsochaí againn mar theanga labhartha ag saoránaigh mar aon le bheith le feiceáil ar chomharthaí agus i litríocht.Treisíonn an Rialtas go mbaineann tábhacht faoi leith leis an nGaeilge do mhuintir, do shochaí agus do chultúr na hÉireann.  Mar theanga labhartha pobail, tá fíorthábhacht léi, ní hamháin chun féiniúlacht mhuintir na hÉireann a chur in iúl ach mar chuid shainiúil den oidhreacht chultúrtha dhomhanda.Ba mhaith liom anois léargas a thabhairt ar an gcineál smaointeoireachta atá sa dréachtstraitéís maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta chun go dtuigfear na hathruithe a d'fhéadfadh a bheith i gceist don eagraíocht sa todhchaí.  Ní miste dom a threisiú arís go mbeidh na hathruithe a dhéanfar ag brath ar mholtaí an chomhchoiste agus faomhadh an Rialtais a bheith faighte.  Maidir leis an bpríomhghníomhaireacht feidhmithe a bheidh freagrach as an straitéis a sheachadadh, tá sé molta go ndéanfaí athstruchtúrú bunúsach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta go gníomhaireacht Ghaeilge nua náisiúnta, Údarás na Gaeilge, a mbeidh freagrachtaí air maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge ar fud an Stáit, chomh maith le cuid mhaith de na feidhmeanna atá aige faoi láthair a choinneáil.  Beidh reachtaíocht le réiteach chun an eagraíocht nua a chur ar bhonn reachtúil.  Bíodh is go leanfadh feidhmiú beartas agus pleananna áirithe Gaeltachta mar fhreagracht ar mo Roinn, d'fhéadfadh sí, áfach, feidhmeanna a tharmligean mar is cuí chuig Údarás na Gaeilge.Ní miste a lua freisin go leanfaidh Foras na Gaeilge ag seachadadh a fhreagrachtaí reachtúla maidir leis an nGaeilge.  Áireofar orthu sin tabhairt faoi thionscadail thacúla agus deontais a thabhairt do chuideachtaí agus do ghrúpaí le tacú leis an teanga mar is cuí, forbairt a dhéanamh ar théarmaíochtaí agus ar fhoclóirí, tacú le hoideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge agus le teagasc na Gaeilge ar an oileán agus éascú agus spreagadh a dhéanamh tríd is tríd ar úsáid na teanga sa saol poiblí agus sa saol príobháideach.  Agus é ag comhlíonadh a dhualgais go hiomlán, ba mhaith liom a threisiú go bhfuil sé i gceist go bhfanfaidh Foras na Gaeilge mar phríomhghné den struchúr tacaíochta don teanga sa dá chuid den oileán, Thuaidh agus Theas.Ina ráiteas i leith na Gaeilge 2006, dhearbhaigh an Rialtas a bheartas maidir leis an Ghaeltacht a neartú mar phobal ina labhraítear Gaeilge agus daingníodh tacaíocht an Rialtais don Ghaeilge.  Tá trí chuspóir a thagraíonn don Ghaeltacht sa ráiteas: tabharfar spreagadh agus tacaíocht do phobal na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di an Ghaeilge a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile mar theanga teaghlaigh agus, chuige sin, cuirfear réimse leathan seirbhísí ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge; tabharfar tacaíocht ar leith don Ghaeltacht mar cheantar labhartha Gaeilge; agus leanfar le treisiú na hoibre atá ar bun ag An Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Comhionannais agus Gaeltachta agus ag na gníomhaireachtaí agus na comhlachtaí a thagann faoina scáth, ar nós Foras na Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn go náisiúnta agus chun í a chaomhnú agus a threisiú sa Ghaeltacht.Moltar sa staidéar cuimsitheach teangeolaíoch ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht 2007 gur chóir gurb é an phríomhfhócas straitéiseach ó thaobh beartas teanga sa Ghaeltacht ná tacaíocht a thabhairt do ghlúnta tuismitheoirí óga Gaeltachta amach anseo agus a chur ar a gcumas a gcuid leanaí a thógáil le Gaeilge.  Dearbhaíonn an staidéar ach go háirithe an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an méid cainteoirí gníomhacha Gaeilge atá i limistéir Ghaeltachta  a chaomhnú agus cur leis an líon sin.  Sa chomhthéacs seo, aithníonn an dréachtstraitéis go mbeidh gá le córas éifeachtach pleanála teanga ag leibhéal an phobail agus samhlaítear go mbeidh ról tábhachtach ag Údarás na Gaeilge i mbeachtú agus i bhfeidhmiú an chórais sin.Tá sé molta sa dréachtstraitéis go mbeadh sé cuí go ndéanfaí cineál nua ‘Gaeltacht gréasáin' a aithint.  Tabharfaidh an chatagóir nua sin deis do spriocthionscnaimh phleanála teanga forbairt a dhéanamh ar phobail/ghréasáin teanga nua lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  I bpobail uirbeacha, a bhfuil mais chriticiúil bhunúsach tacaíochta pobail agus Stáit iontu don Ghaeilge, nithe mar shaoráidí cúraim leanaí trí Ghaeilge, Gaelscoileanna, oideachas dara leibhéal trí Ghaeilge, clubanna óige Gaeilge agus seirbhísí eile a bheidh ann.  Bainfidh critéir shonracha a fhorbrófar don chatagóir sin le dearcthaí poiblí, cumas teanga, soláthar oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge agus an toil a bheith rannpháirteach go gníomhach i dtionscnaimh Ghaeilge.  Tabharfaidh mo Roinnse agus Údarás na Gaeilge tacaíocht do na pleananna teanga sin.Is fiú tagairt a dhéanamh freisin do chuid de na cúraimí a shamhlaítear a bheidh ag Údarás na Gaeilge chun gníomhaíochtaí eacnamaíochta Gaeilge-lárnaithe a spreagadh ar bhonn náisiúnta.  Tá i gceist go mbunófaí sraith tionscnamh le fiontraíocht agus gníomhaíocht eacnamaíochta a spreagadh i measc an phobail a labhraíonn Gaeilge ar bhonn cuideachta, earnála nó áitiúil.  Bheadh an cur chuige le cur i bhfeidhm, mar shampla, trí spreagadh agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don gheilleagar teanga atá in ann na seirbhísí riachtanacha a sholáthar don Stát agus don AE i réimsí mar aistriú, ateangaireacht, múineadh teangacha, foilsiúchán, comhchomhairle teanga, bainistiú tionscadal.  D'áireofaí ar na bearta tacaíocht do ghnólachtaí ag tosú amach, seirbhísí meantóireachta, forbairt táirgí, comhairle faoi mhargú agus chur chun cinn, agus seirbhísí forbartha bainistíochta.Dhéanfadh Údarás na Gaeilge éascú freisin do chruthu chumann tráchtála don Ghaeltacht agus do ghnóthaí eile trí Ghaeilge.  Dhéanfadh an cumann seo tuiscint a chothú i measc an phobail gnó faoin nasc atá idir an teanga agus forbairt eacnamaíochta, lena n-áirítear, mar shampla, an nasc idir leas eacnamaíochta limistéir Ghaeltachta agus stádas na teanga iontu sin, chomh maith le gné na teanga ó thaobh rathúlacht comhlachtaí aonair a bhaineann úsáid éifeachtach as an nGaeilge.  Is léir ón méid seo mar sin féin go bhféadfadh athruithe substaintiúla ar struchtúr agus ar chúraimí Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheith i gceist.Tá leasuithe maidir le cumhachtaí, feidhmeanna agus struchtúr Údarás na Gaeltachta á meas faoi láthair i gcomhthéacs na moltaí atá sa dréachtstraitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  Tá an dréachtstraitéis á scrúdú ag an chomhchoiste Oireachtais faoi láthair.  Tuigim go mbeidh sí le cur faoi mo bhráid go luath.  Fáiltím roimhe sin agus gabhaim buíochas arís as an obair dhíograiseach agus fhiúntach atá curtha i gcrích ag an gcomhchoiste.  Ach an dréachtstraitéis a bheith faofa ag an Rialtas, cuirfear tús le próiseas chun leasuithe substaintiúla a dhéanamh ar an reachtaíocht faoina bhfeidhmíonn Údarás na Gaeltachta chun moltaí éagsúla na straitéise i dtaca leis an údarás a chur i gcrích.Sa chomhthéacs seo, measaim go bhfuil sé inmholta agus cuí gan toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a reáchtáil faoi láthair chun deis a thabhairt an próiseas atá sonraithe thuas a chur i gcrich.  Go hachomair, is é an leasú atáthar ag moladh sa Bhille atá os comhair an Tí inniu ná alt 28(1) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 a leasú ionas go mbeidh síneadh curtha leis an tréimhse is faide idir toghcháin don Údarás ó chúig bliana go leith go dtí seacht mbliana go leith.Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I wish to share my time with Deputy McGinley.Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin mBille seo.  Tuigim go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta an-tábhachtach do na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Seo an chéad deis cainte dom ó cheapadh mar urlabhraí mé.  Tuigim tábhacht na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Tá me ag súil le cuairt a thabhairt ar na Gaeltachtaí go léir i rith an tsamhraidh go mbualfaidh mé leis na daoine agus na coistí iontu le héisteacht lena gcuid tuairimí agus pleananna agus, freisin, feabhas a chur ar mo chuid Ghaeilge.I look forward to working with the Minister and his Department in this important brief.Fine Gael has already opposed this Bill in Seanad Éireann on the basis that the Gaeltacht is suffering more than other regions with high levels of unemployment, a poor transport network, insufficient access to broadband and so on.  The Government is delaying the process under the guise of considering the future structure of Údarás na Gaeltachta and its preparation of a strategy for the Irish language.  In reality, it is merely putting off another election.We believe it is anti-democratic to deny people in the Gaeltacht an opportunity to elect representatives to the body charged with steering the Gaeltacht regions out of this economic crisis.  Under existing legislation, the next election is due to be held by 1 October 2010.  The Bill denies people in the Gaeltacht the right to participate in this election.There are plans under the Government's 20-year strategy for the Irish language to change the structure of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The organisation was reviewed in 2006 and recommendations were made in the comprehensive study on the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht, also in 2006.  The 20-year strategy suggests that the organisation be placed on a statutory footing as a national language agency under new legislation, but this is not expected to be published for some time.As Deputies know, there are 20 members of the board, 17 elected by the community and three others appointed by the Minister.  The Bill actually increases the maximum interval between elections to the board from five years and six months to seven years and six months.  This is undemocratic, and we will be opposing the Bill.

Bhí sé ar chlár an Rialtais le trí nó ceithre bliana agus is minic a chuireamar ceist sa Teach maidir le cén uair a bheadh An Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta os comhair an Tí.  Bhí fanacht fada orainn.  Anois, tá Bille againn, ach ní hé seo an Bille a bhí geallta, an Bille a rabhamar ag fanacht leis a bhí chun breis cumhachtaí agus freagrachtaí a thabhairt agus sainmhíniú eile a thabhairt ar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Bhí muid ag fanacht le blianta, ach anois is é an Bille atá againn ná An Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 2010.  Is Bille an-ghairid é agus níl ach fáth amháin gur tugadh isteach é, is é sin ionas gur féidir leis an Rialtas an toghchán atá dlite ó mhí Aibreán seo caite a sheacaint agus é a chur siar bliain, dhá bhliain nó trí bliana.  Is cuma cad a déarfaidh an tAire nó an Rialtas, níl sin daonlathach.  Tá siad ag teitheadh ón daonlathas.An buntáiste mór atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ná go bhfuil bunús daonlathach leis an údarás.  Bhí Gaeltarra Éireann againn sar a raibh Údarás na Gaeltachta againn.  Rinne Gaeltarra obair mhaith ar fud na tíre agus na Gaeltachta, ach i 1979-80 tháinig Údarás na Gaeltachta agus thug sé deis do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid baill a thoghadh go daonlathach.  Toghadh baill as an Tuaisceart, an iarthar, an deisceart agus fiú as Contae na Mí agus bhíodar go léir san údarás go daonlathach.  Bhí tuiscint acu ar a gceantair féin agus ar na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus ar na féidireachtaí atá sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tá jab an-mhaith déanta acu ó chuireadh ar bun iad.  Mar dhuine atá i mo chónaí sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil oifig de chuid Údaráis na Gaeltachta in aice liom, is féidir liom a rá nach mbeadh an oiread daoine atá ag obair sna Gaeltachtaí inniu ach amháin go raibh Údarás na Gaeltachta ann le blianta anuas ag gníomhú go héifeachtach, ag tabhairt fostaíochta isteach chomh maith le obair, monarchain, tionscail agus araile.  Is cinnte nach mbeadh oiread daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus Gaeilge sna ceantair Gaeltachta ach amháin an obair iontach atá déanta ag an údarás le blianta anuas.Le cúpla bliain anuas, níl an t-údarás ag fáil cothrom na féinne.  Tá na ciorruithe agus an géarchéim airgid ag cur isteach go mór ar an údarás agus is beag tionscnamh atá á cheadú ag an údarás mar nach bhfuil na hacmhainní ná an t-airgead aige leis na deontais ná tacaíocht a thabhairt do fhiontair úra sa Ghaeltacht.  Deacracht eile a fheicim leis an údarás le tamall anuas ná go bhfuil feidhmeannaigh sinsearacha ag fágáil an údaráis.  Tá siad ag dul amach ar phinsean, tá a seal rite agus na blianta curtha isteach acu agus níl éinne á gcur isteach ina n-áít.  Sílim nach bhfuil ach 100 ar fhoireann an údaráis anois.  Roimhe seo, bhí 120 nó 130 ann.  Is daoine tábhachtacha iad na daoine atá ag fágáil.  Feidhmeannaigh sinsearacha iad a bhfuil taithí agus eolas acu ar mhealladh tionscal isteach ón iasacht agus ar chuidiú a thabhairt.  Is cinnte gur easnamh mór é sin ar an údarás i láthair na huaire.  Is cuma mar gheall ar an mBille seo.  Cuirfidh an Rialtas tríd é mar tá tromlach ag an Rialtas. Ní bheidh aon toghchán ann ar feadh dhá nó trí bliana agus is olc an rud é sin.  Ba mhaith liom mar sin féin iarradh ar an Aire — is Aire úr é a thuigeann an Ghaeltacht agus a bhfuil meas aige ar a chuid oibre agus ar an Roinn — díriú isteach ar an bhfadhb sin, sé sin, nuair a fhágann duine sinsearach an t-údarás, go mbeidh duine éigin eile ann lena áit a ghlacadh agus an obair atá á dhéanamh leis na blianta anuas a choinneáil ag dul ar aghaidh.Tá seo go léir ceangailte leis an straitéis 20 bliain.  Níl aon rud ag tarlú anois agus aon cheist a chuirimid sa Dáil, tá an straitéis 20 bliain ag dul sa bhealach.  Nílimid ábalta plean de chineál ar bith eile a dhéanamh ná nílimid ábalta treoir de chineál eile a thógaint mar go bhfuil an straitéis ansin.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an straitéis, ach ní chóir úsáid a bhaint as an straitéis fá choinne an toghchán a chur siar.  Níl sin ceart agus tá sé i gcoinne an daonlathais.Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun ó 1980, 30 bliain.  Bhíomar ag súil le Bille níos mó ná seo, ach caithimid déileáil leis an mBille atá againn.  Mar a dúirt mé, thug an t-údaras tionscail isteach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fad agus rinne sé a dhícheall.  I mo cheantar féin, tá suas le 1,000 duine ag obair i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill agus sa pháirc ghnó i nGaoth Dobhair.  Tá áisleann agus naíonraí á chur ar bun acu agus mar sin de agus tá tacaíocht do sin go léir ag teacht ón údarás.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Más féidir liom a bheith beagáinín paróisteach, tá tionscal i nGaoth Dobhair i láthair na huaire, Bia Ghaoth Dobhair-Largo Foods, a bhfuil deacrachtaí beaga aige.  Feicim an tAire ag croitheadh a cheann agus tuigim go dtuigeann go bhfuil deacracht ansin maidir le pá agus gearradh pá agus mar sin.  Is tionscal an-tábhachtach é sin agus tá cúpla céad duine ag obair ann.  Tá sé mar "anchor industry" ar an eastát agus níor mhaith liom go dtarlódh aon rud dó.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil comhráite ag dul ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire idir na hoibrithe, na ceardchumainn agus an bhainistíocht agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh siad ar chomhréiteach sa dóigh gur féidir leis na poist atá ansin a chosaint agus a chaomhnú.  Tá an t-údarás i ndiaidh cead a thabhairt don tionscal sin tuilleadh fostaithe — 40 — a thabhairt isteach.  Caithfimid an deis sin a thapú, mar tá gach post a chuirtear ar fáil an-thábhachtach ar fad.Mhol MaCárthaigh i dtuairisc an Bhoird Snip go mbainfí feidhm fiontraíochta de Údarás na Gaeltachta agus mhol sé an fheidm sin a thabhairt don IDA nó do dhream éigin eile mar Fhiontar Éireann.  Dá dtarlódh sin, ba bhuille mór a bheadh ann d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ba bhuille mór é dá gcaillfeadh sé an deis a bheith freagrach as feidhm fiontraíochta sin, mar sin an rud, ór a rinne an t-údarás ó chuireadh ar bun é.  Bhí sé ábalta na poist a thabhairt isteach.  Má déantar é sin, ní bheidh fágtha ag an údarás ach feidhm chultúrtha, feidhm teanga agus feidhm shóisialta.  Tá siadsan uilig iontach tábhachtach, ach níl aon mhaitheas leis an údarás muna bhfuil fiontraíocht, fostaíocht agus obair aige fá choinne na daoine atá ina gcónaí ansin a choinneáil.  Ní bheidh aon teanga muna bhfuil daoine ann agus ní bheidh aon daoine muna bhfuil obair ann.  An dream is fearr a thuigeann an dóigh is fearr le obair a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht anois ná Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Níl buntáiste ar bith ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar Fhiontar Éireann.  Tá siad ar na coinníollacha céanna agus tá an modh céanna deontas acu agus mar sin de, ach tá eolas ag an údarás thar na blianta — eolas an-chruinn — ar na ceantair ina bhfuil sé ag gníomhú.Níl a fhios agam cén dearcadh atá ag na daoine atá ar bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an mBille seo.  Nuair a cuirtear siar toghchán, is dóigh go mbraitheann do dhearcadh ar má thoghtar tú.  Dá mbeadh Bille á thabhairt isteach fá choinne cur leis an Dáil, b'fhéidir go mbeinn féin ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Aire.  Tá an bord ann anois le os cionn cúig bliana.  Bhí an toghchán deireanach againn in Aibreán 2005.  Seo 2010 agus tá an bord ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí 2012.  Bhí sé de nós againn é sin a dhéanamh cheana leis na húdaráis áitiúla.  Nuair a bhí an chomhairle contae ann cúig bliana, d'fhéadfadh an toghchán a chur siar go dtí an séú nó an seachtú bliain.  Ach tá deireadh leis sin.  Tugadh isteach reachtaíocht agus níl sin ceadaithe a thuilleadh.  Is mór an trua é nach mbaineann an rud céanna le Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Dá mbeadh toghchán ann agus dá mbeadh mandate úr ag na baill, cuirfeadh sin fuinneamh úr isteach i mbord an údaráis agus cuideodh sin go mór leis an Ghaeltacht.Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá faoin Ghaeltacht.  Is mór an trua é gur Bille beag mar seo atá sa Bhille seo, ag cur siar an toghchán agus ag teitheadh ón daonlathas.  Níl a fhios agam cén uair a bheidh Bille ceart ag teacht isteach, Bille a thabharfaidh sainmhíniú ar na cumhachtaí agus na freagraíochtaí a bheidh ag an údarás.  Is é an eagla atá orm faoi reachtaíocht úr, gur údarás na Gaeilge a bheidh ann.  Níl sin de dhíth orainn.Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta de dhíth orainn sna blianta atá amach romhainn.  Má tá cúraimí eile ann dó ar fud na tíre, tá sin maith go leor ach má thugtar cúraimí Gaeilge dó, an gcuirfidh sin isteach ar Fhoras na Gaeilge, an mbeidh dúbláil i gceist?  Tá na ceisteanna sin le freagair.Seo an chéad Bhille a thug an tAire isteach agus tá súil agam nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt isteach an chéad Bhille eile, go mbeidh Bille tábhachtach ann, Bille a bheidh ag tabhairt téagair agus cumhachta agus freagrachtaí don údarás.  Má dhéanann sé sin, beidh tacaíocht le fáil aige uainne.  Níl sé ag déanamh sin inniu agus sin an fáth go mbeimid ag vótáil i gcoinne an Bhille.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Teachta Frank Feighan, a ceapadh mar urlabhraí nua d'Fhine Gael ar chúrsaí Gaeltachta.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis go breá sa phost nua.Bille gairid é an Bille seo, níl ann ach dhá alt.  Baineann an dara halt leis an ghearrtheideal agus leis an chomhlua.  Ba mhaith liom, áfach, go dtabharfadh an tAire sainmhíniú ar alt 1.  San alt sin, leasaítear alt 28(1) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta 1979 trí"seacht mbliana agus sé mhí" a chur in ionad "cúig bliana agus sé mhí".  Níl aon tagairt don "sé mhí" sin in alt 28(1) den Acht 1979.  Cuireadh isteach na focail "agus sé mhí" mar leasú in Acht Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 1999.  Pointe teicniúil é sin ach ba mhaith liom míniú a fháil ón Aire maidir leis.Ní bheidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille anocht — níl ciall leis sin ag an am seo — agus ní bheimid, ach oiread, ag iarraidh an Bhille a leasú.  Tá an milleán ar an Rialtas go bhfuilimid sa chruachás seo agus go bhfuil air an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach mar ní fiú bord nua a chur in ionad don seal a bheadh i gceist.Tá Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht anois ó 1997 agus fós níl an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge in áit.  Tá an straitéis seo tábhachtach ó thaobh chaomhnú agus fhorbairt na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Caithfidh an straitéis a bheith praiticiúil le spriocanna gur féidir a bhaint amach.  Beidh an comhchoiste ag cur a chuid oibre os comhair na Dála agus tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh díospóireacht sa Dáil faoin obair sin.  Má fheicimid ar an méid a tharla cheana, ní raibh díospóireacht faoin straitéis go dtí seo, cé go raibh díospóireachtaí ag an chomhchoiste, go ndearna an comhchoiste a chuid oibre agus gur eisigh sé tuarascáil eile.  Níl aon eolas ag an bpobal i gcoitinne ar an obair seo.  Caitheadh €750 milliún ar an nGaeilge agus caithfear cur in iúl don bpobal cad díreach atá ar siúl.  Níl eolas ar bith ag formhór na ndaoine faoin straitéis.   Mura ghlacann an pobal i gcoitinne úinéireacht ar an teanga, ní bhainfear an tairbhe is fearr as an straitéis nuair a chuirfear i bheidhm í.Tá seoid againn, an teanga, ach caithfimid cur in iúl do dhaoine atá i bhfabhar na Gaeilge chun gur féidir an tacaíocht sin a neartú.  Níl go leor daoine ag déanamh iarrachta ar bith an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a úsáid mar níl duine ar bith ag cur ina luí orthu gur ceart sin a dhéanamh.  Mionlach ar fud na tíre agus cuid de na Teachtaí istigh anseo, tuigeann siad go bhfuil dréachtstraitéis ann ach níl a fhios ag formhór an phobail.  Ar thaobh amháin, íocann an pobal an cháin lena gcuirtear seirbhísí ar fáil don tír ach ní mór dóibh bheith ar an eolas faoi cad tá ar siúl.  Theip ar an Rialtas go dtí seo an t-eolas a chur os comhair an phobail.Má labhraímid Gaeilge istigh anseo, is beag tuairisc a chítear sna nuachtáin nó ar an teilifís ina thaobh.  Seans go bhfuil suim ag The Irish Times agus na meáin Ghaeilge, ach seachas sin, is beag suim atá ag na meáin ghinearálta.  Tá sé tábhachtach, mar sin, go mbeidh díospóireacht dátheangach againn ar an dréachtstraitéis go gcuirfear an scéal os comhair an phobail.  Tá dualgas orainn mar pholaiteoirí agus mar Bhaill den Teach, agus ar na meáin fosta, an scéal faoin dréachtstraitéis a phoibliú chun go mbeidh díospóireacht ar fud na tíre.Is gá go mbeidh cúram na straitéise i Roinn an Taoisigh.  Tá comhordú ag teastáil agus níl aon Roinn Stáit eile gur féidir an comhordú sin a dhéanamh.  Bíonn an Taoiseach sa Dáil dhá lá sa tseachtain nuair a bhíonn an Dáil ina suí chun freagraí a thabhairt.  Deirtear linn go bhfuil dhá phríomhaidhm ag Fianna Fáil: an tír a athaontú agus an Ghaeilge a athbheochan.  Tagann an Taoiseach isteach agus freagraíonn sé ceisteanna ar na Sé Chontae ach ní fhreagraíonn sé ceisteanna i leith na Gaeilge.  Beidh sin i bhfad níos tábhachtaí nuair a bheidh an straitéis ann.Tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh díospóireacht sa Dáil gach bliain, ar an chéad lá don Teach bheith ar ais, ina gcuirfear spriocanna don bhliain atá le teacht agus ina bhfeicfear ar ais ar an bhliain atá caite agus na spriocanna a bhí ann don bhliain sin.  Ar chuireadh i bhfeidhm na spriocanna sin?  An ceart tabhairt futhu ar shlí eile?  Ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios ag an bpobal go bhfuil straitéis á chur in áit, agus go bhfuil ómós sa Teach seo don teanga.  Chun an fhírinne a rá, is fíor-annamh a labhartar an Ghaeilge sa Teach seo.  Is féidir é sin a athrú.  Tá an-iarracht á dhéanamh ag Baill den Teach seo a chuid Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a fheabhsú.  Níl aon rud níos tábhachtaí ná an dea-shampla.  Iarraim ar an Aire déanamh deimhin de go mbeidh díospóireacht cheart againn ar an dréachtstraitéis.  Tá sé sásta athruithe a dhéanamh ar an dréachtstraitéis agus na moltaí is fearr a thagann ón chomhchoiste a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ba chóir go mbeadh seans ag gach Ball den Teach seo moltaí a dhéanamh, agus go n-eisteódh an t-Aire leis na moltaí sin.  Mar a dúirt sé, ní le haon phairtí an Ghaeilge.  Is linn go léir í.Is trua é go bhfuil orainn déileáil leis an mBille seo anocht.  Ní cheart go mbeimid san áit sin.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, níl sé ciallmhar aon rud eile a dhéanamh um an dtaca seo.  Tá Fianna Fáil sa Rialtas ó 1997.  Chun an fhírinne a rá, is beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta, ó 1997 i leith, ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge de.

Is oth liom go bhfuilimid á phlé — ba chóir go mbeimid ag plé le toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó le torthaí an toghcháin sin.  De réir na reachtaíochta mar atá sí faoi láthair, bhí deis ag an Rialtas an toghchán a eagrú aon uair le breis is bliain anuas.  De réir na reachtaíochta sin, tá sé de cheart ag an Rialtas toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta a eagrú tar éis tréimhse idir ceithre bliana agus cúig bliana go leith.  Sa Bhille beag seo, tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh orainn an daonlathas a chur ar ceal, nó ar athló ar aon chaoi, ar feadh dhá bhliain eile.  Athraíodh an tréimhse idir na toghcháin roimhe seo i 1999, nuair a rinneadh leasú beag bídeach i reachtaíocht ceanann céanna — an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 1999, inar chur an Rialtas sé mhí leis an tréimhse chun a chinntiú go mbainfeadh an toghchán le toghcheantair athruithe an údaráis.  Ag an am, ghlac gach éinne leis gur chóir é sin a dhéanamh.  Níor chuir éinne ina choinne.  Bhí gá leis an athrú toisc nach raibh an Rialtas tar éis reachtaíocht eile — an tAcht um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) (Uimh. 2) 1999 — a ullmhú.  Arís i mbliana, táimid ag déileáil le fadhb an Rialtais, seachas fadhb an Fhreasúra nó fadhb an údaráis.  Níl an obair déanta ag an Rialtas chun an t-athrú suntasach maidir le Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur i bhfeidhm.Tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh orainn iontaoibh a bheith againn as.  Tá sé mar phlean ag an Rialtas go mbeidh an phríomhreachtaíocht os ár gcomhair agus rite in am le haghaidh toghchán i gceann dhá bhliain eile.  Tá go leor ama fós ann chun toghchán a bheith againn i mbliana, roimh 1 Deireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.  Measaim gur féidir linn athrú a dhéanamh a thabharfaidh deis don Rialtas, nuair atá an reachtaíocht mór atá molta críochnaithe sa Teach seo, an túdarás a scoir mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Déanfaidh mé an argóint seo arís i gcomhthéacs leasú atá curtha chun cinn agam.  Ó thaobh an daonlathais de, measaim nach bhfuil sé ceart go bhfuil an toghchán á chur ar athló.  Ba cheart go mbeadh deis ag an bpobal sna ceantair Ghaeltachta a chuid vótaí a chaitheamh.  Measaim freisin gur cheart dúinn soiléiriú do na comhaltaí a thoghadh cúig bliain ó shin cén uair a bheidh críoch lena dtréimhsí mar chomhaltaí an údaráis.  Tá ualach breise de dhá bhliain á chur ag an reachtaíocht seo orthu.  Cuirfidh mé críoch le mo ráiteas ansin.  Déanfaidh mé déileáil leis an chuid eile den méid atá le rá agam nuair atá mé ag moladh an leasaithe atá agam.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an seans cúpla rud a rá faoin reachtaíocht seo.  Bhí toghchán an údaráis le tarlú sé mhí i ndiadh na toghchán rialtais áitiúla, ach tá athrú molta sa Bhille seo.  Tuigim anois go dtarlóidh an toghchán sa bhliain 2012.  Tá an tAire agus an Rialtas ag caint mar gheall ar an straitéis 20 bliain.  Bhí díospóireacht againn ag an gcoiste mar gheall ar an straitéis agus ainm an udaráis.  Tá daoine ag moladh go n-aithreofaí an t-ainm ó "Údarás na Gaeltachta" go "Údarás na Gaeilge" nó "Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge".  Tá sé tábhachtacht, pé ainm a bheidh againn, go mbeidh úsáid na Gaeilge ar ár n-intinn nuair atá an Bille seo agus an túdarás á phlé againn.  Dúirt Colm McCarthy ón mbord snip gur cheart críoch a chur leis an údarás agus a chuid freagrachtaí a thabhairt do Enterprise Ireland.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin ceart ach an oiread.It is important to point out that Údarás na Gaeltachta has been concerned in a major way with employment and has done much good work in promoting employment in Gaeltacht areas.  This is not the only function carried out by the authority.I welcome what the Údarás has done with regard to ferry transport.  I refer to transport to the Aran Islands in County Galway as well.  The Údarás has been involved a good deal in air travel to the islands, which should not be forgotten.I refer to some other matters often forgotten, for example, the idea of providing child care projects in Gaeltacht areas.  The Údarás has been very proactive in securing sites for child care and crèches.  Similarly, there are co-operatives in some of the smaller Gaeltachts such as Rath Cairn and Baile Ghib in County Meath.Another important feature of Údarás na Gaeltachta is the fact that it works very effectively with local authorities.  I understand it works with the local authorities in Donegal and Galway especially towards the further development of the Gaeltacht in those counties.The Údarás record on employment is very good.  It is true to say the Údarás has lost very few jobs in Gaeltacht areas.  Recently, I met the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, in Indrebhán at the opening of a factory.The Údarás also moves with the times.  It was proactive when it became apparent that TG4 would come on stream.  The authority was able to make its programmes suitable to people coming to work with TG4.  In Belmullet, County Mayo, I understand a great effort was made by Údarás na Gaeltachta to create a building which could facilitate local authority work, including road tax, planning applications and library facilities, and a court house within its regional office.  That is a good practical example of an t-údarás and local authorities working together.  There have been good stories involving this agency in the areas of fish farming and pharmaceuticals.  As a Member representing a non-Gaeltacht area, I have been jealous that an t-údarás has been too good.  Sometimes it secured grants for so-called sensitive industries such as light engineering and cement production, which could not be secured for other areas outside the Gaeltacht.  I was a member of Galway County Council and I was very much aware of its partnership with an t-údarás.  I hope the example of Carraroe library can be replicated in other parts of the country.The straitéis represents a new departure in the work of an t-údarás, with the body getting involved in universities.  There is a budget for education and perhaps the Minister can indicate the allocation when he replies.  Questions have been asked about an t-údarás getting involved in education when the priority should be employment and industrial development.  I welcome its involvement in the sector, although others have a different view.  The question of how Roinn na Gaeltachta features in this issue must also be addressed.Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl anocht.  Tá an t-údarás an-tábhachtach agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann níos mó post a chur ar fáil.  Tá súil agam freisin go n-éireoidh leis an Aire forbairt a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá baill an údaráis ag obair go dian.  Anois tá an straitéis 20 bliain ann agus ní mór dúinn obair le chéile ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeilge.  Tá níos mó le déanamh ar son tuarasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht.  Téann a lán daoine óga chuig na coláistí samhraidh chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Uaireanta, téann an chlann iomlán go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Tá comórtas peile na Gaeltachta ag feabhsú, le tuilleadh daoine ag glacadh páirte sa chomórtas sin.Caithfimid moladh a thabhairt do Raidió na Gaeltachta agus do TG4.  Déanann siad cur síos iontach ar nuacht na Gaeltachta agus ar cheol, ar rince agus ar chultúr na háite.  Mar fhreagra don Teachta O'Shea, tá úsáid na Gaeilge le cloisteáil sna Gaelscoileanna agus sna scoileanna Gaeltachta.

Labhair an Teachta Kitt faoi phoist sa Ghaeltacht ach níl a lán jobanna sa Ghaeltacht le ceithre bliana anuas.  Principally, however, the Bill is concerned with the Government postponing the election to an t-údarás, not jobs in the Gaeltacht.  The Government does not want to call the by-elections or this election.  It should hold a general election and the election to an t-údarás on the same day.  Even in Gaeltacht areas, where Fianna Fáil was traditionally strong, it is afraid of an election.  Naturally it is holding on to power given its majority on an t-údarás and it is afraid of losing many seats, even in a Gaeltacht area.I congratulate the Minister on his appointment but I appeal to him to hold the election.  He should not be afraid of an election.  Perhaps the long grass is not as bad as he thinks it might be, although the people are waiting there. Tá súil agam nach mbeidh a lán baill san údarás ag an Rialtas nuair a bheidh an toghchán sin ann.

Tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé sár-jab agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann comhoibriú le chéile.Níl an Rialtas ag iarraidh teitheadh ón gcóras daonlathach.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh mé in ann reachtaíocht chuimsitheach nua a thabhairt isteach sa Teach i bhfad níos luaithe ná Deireadh Fómhair 2012.  Táimid ag brath go leanófar leis an chomhoibriú atá ann faoi láthair go mbeidh mé in ann an straitéis a thabhairt os comhair an Rialtais chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.  Aontaím leis an Teachta O'Shea, bheadh sé an-aisiúil go mbeadh díospóireacht chuimsitheach againn ar an gcéad lá de gach bliain Dála go mbeadh seans againn féachaint siar agus spriocanna a leagan síos don bhliain atá le teacht.  Níl an tuarascáil agam fós.  Tabharfar don chomhchoiste an tseachtain seo chugainn nó an tseachtain ina dhiaidh sin í agus ní féidir mórán a rá go dtí go bhfeicim í.

Dúradh a lán rudaí faoin dréachtstraitéis.  Sin an chuid is fearr den scéal atá a insint againn agus tá sé práinneach go gcuirfear sin i bhfeidhm chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.Luaigh an Teachta McGinley gníomhaíochtaí an údaráis agus Largo Foods.  Cheadaigh an Rialtas don údarás infheistíocht fhiúntach a thabhairt don chuideachta seo coicís ó shin agus tá 40 post le cruthú de thoradh air sin.  Tá tograí maithe eile le teacht freisin agus tá súil agam go mbeidh fógraí eile á ndéanamh go luath.  Luaigh an Teachta freisin cúrsaí foirne.  Tuigeann an Teach go gcaithfidh eagrais feidhmiú de réir na dtreoirlínte atá i bhfeidhm ag an Rialtas agus tá srianta áirithe i bhfeidhm faoi láthair, cé go gcloisim an méid atá le rá aige.D'iarr an Teachta O'Shea sainmhíniú a thabhairt ar an mBille.  Fuair mé comhairle ón Ard Aighne go bhfuil na hAchtanna 1979 agus 1999 le léamh in éineacht a chéile.  Luadh na hAchtanna sin ar leathanach 5 den mBille.  Tá moltaí an-suimiúla ag an Teachta.  Ba mhaith liom iad a phlé leis amach anseo.  Rinne mé dearmad rud amháin a rá.  Táimid go léir buíoch don Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív.  Rinne sé sár-obair ar son na Gaeilge nuair a bhí sé sa Roinn seo.  Ní aontaím nach raibh aon rud a dhéanamh ag an Rialtas seo ar feadh blianta fada.  Tá a lán déanta.  Má thaistilíonn éinne timpeall na Gaeltachtaí, beidh sé soiléir go bhfuil sár-obair a dhéanamh againn.  Tá leathnú agus treisiú tagtha ar an nGaeilge sna gaelscoileanna, mar shampla.  Tá fadhbanna ann, ceart go leor, ach tá mórán déanta.  Gabhaim buíochas le gach éinne a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht.  Rinne mé dearmad trácht a dhéanamh ar an leasú atá le moladh ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, ach is féidir linn é a phlé ar Chéim an Choiste.

Tá mé ag iarraidh a chinntiú nach bhfuil an daonlathas á chur ar athló againn.  Ní cheart dúinn an toghchán a chur siar níos faide ná mar is gá.  Is féidir linn an toghchán a eagrú roimh 1 Deireadh Fómhair i mbliana.  Thabharfadh sé sin deis do phobal na Gaeltachta údarás nua a thoghadh.  Molaim gur féidir an túdarás nua a scoir tar éis bliana, más gá, nó aon am suas go dtí cúig bliana go leith, mar atá sa reachtaíocht cheana féin.  Mar a luaigh mé, nuair a chaith muintir na Gaeltachta a chuid vótaí chun an túdarás reatha a thoghadh, thuig siad go mbeadh na baill in áit le haghaidh tréimhse áirithe, agus go gcríochnódh an tréimhse sin roimh Dheireadh Fómhair 2010.  Rinneadh conradh leis an bpobal nuair a chuaigh daoine ag vótáil i 2005.Chomh maith leis sin, bhí conradh déanta leis na baill a bhí tofa go mbeidís in oifig ar feadh cúig bliana go leith.  Mar an gcéanna, nuair atáimid tofa, tuigimid go mbeimid sa Dáil ar feadh tréimhse de chúig bliana, ar a mhéad.  Ní chuirtear leis sin ach más gá.  Má theipeann an Rialtas is féidir sinne a chur faoi bhráid an phobail arís.  I gcás an túdaráis, an rud a bhí ann roimhe seo ná go mbeadh an údarás ann, agus bord an údaráis, ar feadh tréimhse nach bhfuil níos lú ná ceithre bliana, nó níos mó ná cúig bliana go leith.  Tuigim cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an Bille atá á fhógairt ag an Rialtas, ach níl a fhios agam an dtiocfaidh sé amach i gceann bliana, i gceann dhá bhliain nó i gceann trí bliana.  Ní Bille beag a bheidh i gceist.  Bille cuíosach suntasach a bheidh ann.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé fite fuaite leis an straitéis teanga agus go mbeidh an chumhacht ag an údarás tabhairt faoi gnéithe oiriúnacha na straitéise.  Níl mé chun plé iomlán a dhéanamh ar an straitéis, ar an Ghaeilge nó ar tharrtháil na Gaeilge.Tugadh feidhmeanna cuíosach suntasach don údarás nuair a chuireadh ar bun é sa chéad dul síos.  Tá mé ag caint mar dhuine atá ina chónaí sa chathair.  Tríd is tríd, tá tar éis éirí cuíosach maith leis an údarás ó thaobh roinnt de na feidhmeanna a bhí ag an údarás, poist a chruthú agus monarchana agus comhlachtaí a mhealladh isteach i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Chomh maith leis sin, bhí obair eile leagtha síos.  Níl a fhois agam cé chomh mhaith is a d'éirigh leis an údarás, ó thaobh caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar phríomh meán cumarsáide na Gaeltachta a spreagadh.  Níl a fhios agam ar bhain baill an túdaráis é sin amach, mar an phríomhaidhm a bhí liostaithe ag an údarás.  Tá a fhios agam gur dhein an údarás obair.  Tá súil agam nach dtógfar an aidhm sin ón údarás, nó pé struchtúr a chuirfear sa tsiúl, amach anseo.Ba mhaith liom labhairt mar gheall ar an toradh a bheidh ar an leasú seo dá nglacfaí leis.  Ní hamháin go mbeadh toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta againn, ach freisin beimid in ann bord nua an údaráis a scoir aon am is mian leis an Aire tar éis bliain amháin.  Má tá moill ar an reachtaíocht atá á chur le chéile faoi láthair, ar fáth amháin nó fáth eile, beidh an Rialtas in ann bord an údaráis a fhágaint sa tsiúl ar feadh tréimhse suas go dtí cúig bliana go leith.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh an gá sin ann, ach ní fios go mbeidh.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh olltoghchán againn agus beidh gach rud ina chíréib agus ina chac ar feadh roinnt míonna ina dhiaidh.  Níl a fhois againn.  Tá mé ag iarraidh a dhéanamh cinnte de go dtarlóidh rud éigin agus, ar a laghad, muna dtarlaíonn an reachtaíocht sin, go mbeidh údarás ann leis na bunfeidhmeanna atá ag an údarás faoi láthair.  Mar atá léite amach agam cheana féin, tá sé mar phríomhfheidhm ag an údarás an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathnú.  Tá ról reatha an údaráis — an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn — leagtha amach sa straitéis cheana féin.  Más gá an struchtúr a choinneáil mar atá sé ar feadh tréimhse beag eile, ba chóir dúinn é sin a dhéanamh.Níl mé ag iarraidh moill a chur ar an Teach agus muid ag déileáil leis an leasú beag seo, ach ba mhaith liom pointe eile a dhéanamh.  Tá sé luaite ag daoine eile go bhfuil eagla ar an Rialtas dul os comhair an phobail agus is fíor sin.  Tá seasamh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ar an gceist seo ait.  Cheap mé go mbeidís ag iarraidh brú a chur ar an Rialtas dul os comhair an phobail in aon toghchán — na trí fhothoghcháin, toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta nó olltoghchán.  Ba chóir go mbeadh na fothoghcháin tarluithe cheana féin.  Is trua é nach bhfuil Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt tacaíochta dos na páirtithe Freasúra eile agus sinn ag cur i gcoinne na reachtaíochta seo.  Tá fadhbanna ollmhóra na tíre le thabhairt faoi ndeara sna ceantair Ghaeltachta freisin.  Tá mé ag caint faoi fadhbanna fostaíochta, infreastruchtúra, dífhostaíochta, turasóireachta agus, anois agus arís, imirce.  Tuigeann éinne a tógadh sa Ghaeltacht, nó a chaith aon tréimse fada sa Ghaeltacht, conas mar a buaileadh na ceantair sin go dona maidir le himirce.  Bheadh sé níos fearr dá mbeadh údarás nua in ann déileála leis na ceisteanna atá le freagairt.  Ba chóir go mbeadh bord nua, le sainordú nua, tofa ar feadh tréimhse éigin, ionas go mbeidh sé in ann tabhairt faoi na ceisteanna sin.  Molaim go mbeadh an tréimhse sin bliain ar a laghad, ach d'fhéadfadh sí a bheith suas go dtí cúig bliana go leith muna bhfuil an reachtaíocht nua i réim níos luaithe.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, is í aidhm an Bhille seo ná síneadh a chur le tréimhse oifige bhord reatha Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Ciallóidh sé seo go mbeidh leanúnachas ann le linn tréimhse thar a bheith cinniúnach don eagraíocht, nuair a bheidh leasuithe maidir lena cumhachtaí, feidhmeanna agus struchtúr á mheas.  Sa reachtaíocht atá i bhfeidhm cheana féin, tugtar tréimhse cheithre bliana ar a laghad do bhaill tofa an Údaráis.  Ní shílim go mbeadh sé cuí, sa chomhthéacs atá i gceist leis an reachtaíocht seo, é sin a laghdú mar atá molta ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh.  Sa reachtaíocht chéanna, is é cúig bliana go leith an tréimhse is faide idir thoghcháin don bhord.  Dá nglacfaí leis an leasú atá molta ag an Teachta, bheadh athrú substaintiúil déanta ar an mBille, rud a chuirfeadh comhartha ceiste maidir le bailíocht na mball tofa tar éis 2 Deireadh Fómhair 2010.Ní mór cur san áireamh go bhfuil sé i gceist reachtaíocht nua maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta a ullmhú chomh luath agus a bheidh an straitéis 20 bliain faofa ag an Rialtas.  I measc nithe eile, bainfidh an reachtaíocht sin le ceisteanna faoi chomhdhéanamh agus faoi thréimhsí íosta agus uasta an bhoird.  Dá bhrí sin, níl mé chun glacadh leis an leasú seo.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Ní dhéanann an leasú seo aon difríocht.  Caithfidh an toghchán a bheith ann le linn tréimhse níos lú na ceithre bliana.  Tá ceithre bliana caite agus dá bhrí sin is féidir go mbeidh an toghchán ann ag aon am.  Ní dhéanann leasú an Aire ach seal eile a chur le tréimhse an bhoird, gur féidir leis an bhord faoi láthair bheith ann go ceann seacht mbliana go leith.  Níl aon athrú ar an cheithre bliana agus mar sin is féidir toghchán a reáchtáil.Chuir sé ionadh ar an Teachta Ó Snodaigh nach bhfuil Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo.  Shíl mé go raibh mé soiléir faoi seo.  Ní féidir an reachtaíocht nua a chur in áit roimh 1 Meán Fómhair, níl an dhréachtstraitéis aontaithe go fóill fiú agus ní mór reachtaíochta a bheidh casta go leor a chur in áit.  Níl mé ag moladh an Rialtais, a mhalairt ar fad.  Is beag atá déanta aige i leith na straitéise ó 1997.  Tá milleán ar an Rialtas go bhfuilimid sa chruachás seo ach níl ciall ar bith aon rud eile a dhéanamh seachas an toghchán a chur siar agus an bord a fhágáil mar atá sé.Tá rudaí eile ann faoin reachtaíocht nua.  Dé réir na gcosúlachta, beidh bord níos lú ann don Ghaeltacht agus ionadaithe air ó cheantair eile; cuireann sin eagla orm nach mbeidh áit ar an bhord do na trí Ghaeltacht bheaga - Gaeltacht na nDéise, Gaeltacht Uíbh Ráthach agus Gaeltacht Ráthchairn.  Tá mé ag iarraidh bheith praiticiúil, áfach, agus níl sé praiticiúil an toghchán a reáchtáil anois.  Sin an áit ina bhfuilimid.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Tá a lán ráite faoin toghchán a chur ar ceal go ceann cúpla bliain faoin mBille.  Ní hé sin an rud is tábhachtaí; ba mhaith liom níos mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá sin ag dul in olcas i gConamara.  Sna Gaelscoileanna tá a lan oibre déanta ag na múinteoirí agus ag na tuismitheoirí, agus tá níos mó béime ar labhairt na Gaeilge ná mar atá sna scoileanna Gaeltachta.Because of the efforts put in over the years for the revival of Irish and the use of Irish by the people in the Gaeltacht it is important that i bhfad níos mó béime would be put on the speaking of Irish.  The Minister has been involved in education down the years and I hope he would emphasise to the Minister for Education and Skills, who is herself an Irish speaker, that once and for all, the emphasis in education with regard to Irish should be changed, in particular at primary school level.  It has been clearly identified in the Gaelscoileanna throughout the country that where there is an emphasis on the spoken language, it can succeed.  Nobody in Europe can understand why it is that after six to ten years' in education that we, collectively, come out the other end unable to converse in our native tongue.  There is talk of a report and a review.  It is most important that this review puts the emphasis on making the Irish language acceptable and making it easy to converse in.At one time the universities taught Old Irish and Old English.  The teaching of Irish must be tackled in a meaningful way.  The Irish language in its written form is presented by the newspaper, Foinse and The Irish Times which regularly publishes a column that is easy to read and writes about issues in very attractive, simple Irish.  It can be read and understood without any difficulty.  If a review of the Irish language and our commitment to it is to be carried out, there is no point just blaming any Minister or Government at any given time; there must be a willingness on the part of the people themselves, on all of us, to use the Irish language.  It is embarrassing that many young immigrants are being taught in the gaelscoileanna and they are chomh líofa le gach duine eile sa rang.I did not have an opportunity to speak on Second Stage.  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me speak on this issue.  I want to make the point to the Minister that if this review is going through, it must re-examine the written word and its presentation.  There is need for the grammar to be revised and simplified.  There are difficulties that make young children turn away from the language.  I hope the Minister and his officials, in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills, would examine the presentation of the Irish language, both the written and spoken word.  We have to pay tribute to TG4 and Raidió na Gaeltachta for all they have done and to the media which presents the written word, Foinse and The Irish Times.

Ansin, nuair a bheadh sé cuí, i ndiaidh ritheadh na reachtaíochta a mhol an tAire, agus an Teachta Ó Cuív roimhe le ceithre bliana anuas, ag déileáil leis na hathruithe a bheadh réidh le tabhairt isteach, d'fhéadfaí an t-údarás nua sin a scoir.  Aon am tar éis tréimhse bliana, d'fhéadfadh an tAire ordú a thabhairt a chuirfeadh deireadh leis an bhord sin go dtiocfadh an bord nua, agus cibé struchtúr a bheadh i gceist aige, i bhfeidhm.  Tugann sin deis don Aire agus don Rialtas níos mó ama a chaitheamh le cinntiú go mbeidh cibé struchtúr nua a thiocfaidh i réim foirfe leis na feidhmeanna cearta.Má tá trí bliana de dhíth, ar a laghad ní bheimid ag teacht ar ais i gceann bliana a rá go gcaithfimid síneadh ama eile ag thabhairt agus ní bheimid ag rith reachtaíochta faoi dheifir.  Faoin gclár ama a leagtar amach anseo, caithfear gach rud a dheánamh go huile is go hiomlán roimh Dheireadh Fómhair 2012.  Sin brú ollmhór ó thaobh na straitéise de.  Smaoinítear cé chomh fada agus a bhí de dhíth chun déileáil leis an tuarascáil maidir le meath na Gaeltachta agus cé chomh mall agus atá an Rialtas — agus sinn féin chomh maith — leis an straitéis a leagan síos.  Is féidir linn cúpla mí a thabhairt dúinn féin más gá.  Más féidir linn é a chur isteach i gceann bliana, déanfaidh an leasú cinnte go dtiocfaidh deireadh leis an bhord nua.Déanann an tAire iarracht loighciúil a rá gur chóir go mbeidh leanúnachas ann.  Faoin loighic chéanna, ba chóir go gcuirfí síneadh le tréimhse an Rialtais seo, go dtabharfaí cúpla bliain eile toisc na hathruithe suntasacha atá ag teacht ar an gheilleagar.  Ní aontaím leis sin.In ainneoin a dúirt an Teachta O'Shea, ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt tacaíochta do sheasamh an Fhreasúra ag lorg toghcháin roimh Dheireadh Fómhair i mbliana, go mbeadh bunadh na Gaeltachta ag caitheamh vóta i bhfabhar nó i gcoinne na mbeartas atá an Rialtas seo ag cur i bhfeidhm.  Bheadh i bhfad níos mó acu ag cur i gcoinne an Rialtais ná mar a tharla go dtí seo.  Sin an fáth gur ait liom nach bhfuil an páirtí ag seasamh linn anois.

Cur amú acmhainní Stáit a bheadh ann dá mbeadh toghchán ann anois agus ansin ceann eile i gceann bliana.  Nílim chun an leasú a ghlacadh.Rinne an Teachta Ulick Burke roinnt pointí maithe maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge.  Iar-mhúinteoir is ea mé féin.  Tá cuid mhaith le déanamh againn sa chóras oideachais agus táim ag plé na ceiste sin leis an Aire faoi láthair.  Tá mórán le rá sa straitéis faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais.  I measc príomhspriocanna na straitéise, tá líon na ndaoine a bhaineann úsáid as an nGaeilge go laethúil a mhéadú ó 85,000 faoi láthair go dtí 250,000 roimh 2030.  An-sprioc é sin ach is féidir é a bhaint amach má leanaimid ar aghaidh leis an phróiseas atá againn faoi láthair, is cuma cén páirtí a bheidh i réim.Aontaíonn formhór an phobail sa tír gur gá rud éigean a dhéanamh sa treo is gur féidir linn cur leis an nGaeilge.

Tá súil againn, ag an chéad chruinniú eile den chomhchoiste iomlán ar an 14 Iúil, go mbeimid in ann an obair a thabhairt chun críche agus saothar ar gcuid oibre agus na haighneachtaí a rinneadh a chur chuig an Aire agus a chur os comhair an Rialtais chomh luath agus is féidir.Tá lúcháir orm mar iar-mhúinteoir go bhfuil an tAire agus an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna ag dul i gcomhairle le chéile maidir le teagasc na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.  Is léir nach bhfuil ag éirí leis an bheartas a bhí á chur i bhfeidhm go dtí seo.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth, seans go bhfuil gá le níos mó béime ar an chomhrá in ionad litríochta agus scríobh.  Comhartha dochais é sin.Rinne an tAire tagairt ar 250,000 cainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge sa bhliain 2030.  Tá aicme eile ar a gcaithfimid díriú isteach: cainteoirí dúchais.  Tá uimhir na gcainteoirí dúchais faoi bhrú i láthair na huaire.  Mura bhfuil cór cainteoirí dúchais Ghaeilge sa tír, gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga teaghlaigh agus teallaigh, ní mhairfidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo.  Beidh sí cosúil leis an Laidin; bhí Laidin againn go léir agus sinn ar scoil ach cé atá ag labhairt Laidine?  Ní raibh cainteoirí dúchais Laidine aon áit ar domhan, fiú sa Róimh féin, leis na cianta.Is cainteoir dúchais mé féin agus feicim cad tá ag tarlú timpeall orm gach lá, go bhfuil cainteoirí dúchais faoi bhrú.  I measc na moltaí sa straitéis, caithfear cuidiú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do theaghlaigh a thógfaidh a gclann le Gaeilge mar tá laige mhór ansin.  Tá ról fosta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta obair a chur ar fáil do na tuismitheoirí.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	443	As it is now 10 o'clock and in accordance with an order of the Dáil today, I am required to put the following question:"That sections 1 and 2 are hereby agreed to in Committee; the Title is hereby agreed to in Committee; the Bill is accordingly reported to the House; that the Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed."
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I thank the Minister for allowing me the opportunity to raise a sensitive issue concerning Paul Barrett from Market Hill in Fethard, County Tipperary, who is detained in prison in Lille, France.The story of Paul Barrett goes back to 7 March when a truck he was driving was impounded by the French authorities.  He was allowed home and left the truck behind him.  A week later he was contacted by his employer who told him the truck was to be collected in France.  Paul Barrett was arrested by French police on his return to France on 14 March when he arrived to collect the truck and he has been detained in France since then.  Last Friday he was brought before a magistrate.  Documents that were required for the investigation were to be provided by the Government to the French authorities.  That is my understanding but I need clarification on the matter.  To his horror and that of his family and all belonging to him he was put back in prison.I and others have listened to the family talk about the case in recent months.  They are in a state trying to find out what is happening to their son.  I have a letter which he wrote from prison some hours after the case was heard last week.  I have never read an account of such a frightened person in a letter from anyone.  A person in detention in a prison in another country is bound to be frightened.  Mr. Barrett is worried about his representation in particular.  Much of what I say I have heard from the family which is highly respected in the community.  I have known them for a long time.  They are extremely worried about their son.  They are concerned about the handling of the case by the solicitor, which is not to their satisfaction.  That concern is expressed in the letter which Mr. Barrett's mother handed to me in my constituency office this morning.  The reason I raise the matter is because those people are living in fear.  They are extremely concerned about the representation their son is receiving.  His mother said she is extremely concerned that her son will come home in a box.  As a representative of the Government the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has a responsibility to this man.I did not refer in my contribution to the implications of the case or how the truck came to be there and what was in it.  My concern is the individual involved and the human aspect of the case.  The Government has a responsibility to this young man.  Usually when we raise matters on the Adjournment we do not get an answer.  I accept that officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in contact with the family, but someone in the Government needs to take the case firmly in hand to give Mr. Barrett his legal right to choice in terms of being properly represented.  If the Irish Government has documentation on Mr. Barrett, it should be sent to the French authorities.  The French courts will be in recess in two weeks and this will mean he will be in prison until next September.I am thankful for the opportunity to raise this very sensitive matter.  In the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, who has met the family in question, I want the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to do everything he can, in spite of the ongoing frustration, to save the young man's life.  His mother, brothers, sisters, father, everyone belonging to him and the people of the Fethard area are extremely shocked at what is happening and believe he is innocent.  The Government has a responsibility to help him.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I can well understand the concerns of any family with a member detained, for whatever reason, in another jurisdiction.  It is difficult.  It is very traumatic for a young man to be detained in a jurisdiction with whose legal processes he may be unfamiliar.  Mr. Paul Barrett is an Irish citizen and is currently in detention in Lille in France.  He was arrested on 16 March this year by the customs authorities in Caen on charges relating to the transportation of a large amount of illicit cigarettes.I understand the worries of Mr. Barrett's family and empathise with it, particularly his mother, regarding his arrest and detention.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has met the family and assured it every assistance will be offered.  The consular assistance section of the Department and the embassy in Paris have been heavily involved in this case.  We have maintained close contact with Mr. Barrett's family on all consular matters associated with the case.  However, there is a clear distinction between the provision of consular assistance, which we can and do provide, and legal proceedings in another jurisdiction, which we cannot interfere with.On this subject, a lawyer was appointed to represent Mr. Barrett by the French court.  The Department has provided Mr. Barrett, through his family, with a list of alternative lawyers should he be unhappy with his current representation.  It is solely a matter for the French court to decide on Mr. Barrett's guilt or otherwise in this case.Our embassy in Paris has made, and will continue to make, every effort to ensure that Mr. Barrett is treated no less favourably than a local citizen would be treated if he were charged with a similar offence.  The assistance provided thus far has included, inter alia, two visits by a member of our embassy staff in Paris, who has travelled to Lille expressly for this purpose.The Deputy made a very clear case that there are concerns regarding Mr. Barrett's health.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been in continuous contact with his family on that issue.  We have raised the family's concerns with the prison authorities.  Our embassy has gone so far as to make contact with the prison kitchen staff to convey recommendations made by Mr. Barrett's family as to his dietary requirements.The embassy is informed that Mr. Barrett is assessed and monitored on a regular basis by the prison doctor and the prison psychologist, who lived for a number of years in Ireland and who speaks fluent English.  That is important in such a case.  The replies we have received from the prison, following the many requests for clarification that we have made, confirm the prison had no significant physical or psychological issues to report regarding the health and general welfare of Mr. Barrett.  The latest such request for an update was received today and notes that, at present, Mr Barrett is not deemed what has been described as "a danger to himself".  This should be of assurance to the family.  The doctor has advised that if there were any doubt in this regard, Mr. Barrett would be placed under observation.The Department of Foreign Affairs has a large number of consular cases and has a good record in respect of them, particularly traumatic cases such as this.  I assure the Deputy and, through him, the Barrett family, that the Department will continue to liaise with the French authorities on Mr. Barrett's behalf through the embassy in Paris, which has worked very hard on his behalf.  We will keep in contact with the family on developments pertaining to the case.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	446	Deputy English is giving way to Deputy McEntee.I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me and my Oireachtas colleagues to raise the extremely important issue of the 400 kV Meath-Tyrone interconnector passing through Cavan-Monaghan.  We want to know where the Minister stands on this issue given that EirGrid withdrew its application on 29 June due to misinformation that was put on the planning notice, and possibly on other issues.Community groups and individuals made a great voluntary effort to brief themselves on the planning laws and how this application would affect their homes and communities.  They collected significant moneys in their communities and this has been spent on costs of legal and other experts whom they had to pay.  I urge the Minister to ensure that these groups are reimbursed their out-of-pocket expenses in light of the fact that EirGrid withdrew the application.Under the relevant section of the relevant legislation, section 182, the cost does not have to be reimbursed in a Bord Pleanála case for electricity or gas lines.  On EirGrid's own admission, however, the application in this instance was faulty, in which context the circumstances are totally different.Under ordinary planning laws, a plan would be examined and validated by the planning authorities before acceptance.  However, no such requirement exists regarding An Bord Pleanála, which is unfair.  It is also unfair that a differentiation should be made between an interconnector and a road structure.  Section 182 must be changed as it is unconstitutional and unfair under EU law.Can the Minister of State advise when the planning structures will be put in place in Northern Ireland?  If there is a public hearing, it could take up to six or seven years.  Does the Minister of State not agree that, in the present economic circumstances, the scheme should be put on hold until the legal issues are sorted out and until more research is done regarding underground cabling, which is becoming more possible technically by the day.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I thank my colleague Deputy English and all my colleagues in the north east for the opportunity to speak on this matter.I want to make a few basic points on the recent embarrassing withdrawal by EirGrid of its planning application for the Meath-Tyrone interconnector project.  I live in the heart of the north east where serious stress and anxiety have been visited on many constituents on foot of EirGrid's proposal.  There are a number of lessons that need to be learned from the sorry state of affairs brought about by EirGrid's performance and actions at the oral hearing into its planning submission.An issue arises regarding respect for the integrity of the public consultation process, which is a central pillar of our democracy.  Three years ago, EirGrid announced its intention to place over 100 km of extra-high-voltage lines and over 300 massive pylons across the region.  The public responded by engaging fully in the democratic process of public consultation.  It formed local representative groups, such as NEPP and others, and met elected representatives.  They made submissions at joint Oireachtas committee hearings, met EirGrid and even went abroad to meet other transmission system operators.  The people of the north east raised significant funds to examine acceptable alternatives, especially the undergrounding of the cables.  They have never resorted to any activities other than those associated with dialogue and persuasion, based on well-researched evidence.  They have participated fully with the oral hearing process and have at all times behaved in a respectful and professional manner.The groups were met by a semi-State company that has shown total disregard for its duties and its responsibility to the very public it is charged with serving.  It is unacceptable that EirGrid, which through the taxpayer had access to unlimited resources and consultant expertise, could have been allowed to submit such a shoddy application, withdraw it whenever it suited and then walk away with no apparent accountability or penalties.  This is an injustice to the people of the north east, an injustice which we as elected representatives cannot ignore, nor can we stand idly by.  EirGrid may or may not have a statutory obligation to reimburse the public participants and voluntary groups for their reasonable costs, but it certainly has a moral obligation to do so.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has an even greater responsibility to ensure they are reimbursed.  Ignoring the issue will only serve to alienate the public even further from the democratic process and will harden their resolve in vigorously opposing the project.  EirGrid has lost all credibility in the eyes of the people of the north east.  Let us not join it by sitting on our hands.The second lesson we need to learn is that the oral hearing has shown yet again that undergrounding cables is a practical, win-win solution for all concerned.  However, EirGrid has remained steadfastly opposed to examining this option properly.  There is deep frustration in rural communities that EirGrid can ignore this alternative without any accountability.  In contrast with other countries, we have not been subjected to a blight of pylons across our countryside and we should not allow it to occur.  When established, they impose significant negative effects in terms of visual and environmental impact, land and property devaluation and health and safety concerns.  This clear fact is neither addressed by EirGrid nor factored into its project cost estimates.I call on the Minister to compel EirGrid to return to the drawing board, rid itself of its inherited bias towards pylons and get real about addressing the practical option of undergrounding.  I understand there are technical challenges around this option, but technology moves quickly and we need to move with it rather than against it.  For EirGrid to submit a patched up version of its original planning application would waste taxpayers' resources further because it would be a futile exercise.

The time expended, the energy employed and the financial outlay demanded of all concerned has been considerable.Given EirGrid's decision to withdraw its application in the later stages of the hearing process, the Government must commit to meeting all reasonable costs incurred by these individuals, families and communities.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources must also undertake to amend the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 to provide for automatic reimbursement in such cases and for a verification by An Bord Pleanála of the detail of all applications made under this legislation in future.In light of all that has been exposed and the toll the process has taken on so many ordinary citizens, the Minister should instruct EirGrid to place a stay on any further application of at least 24 months, inform itself of the prospects of approval and the intention to proceed to work stage if approved of the NIE application North of the Border, and undertake to set international best standards in preparing any future application by committing to employ underground cabling in place of the overheard pylon-supported power lines.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I wish to apologise on behalf of my constituency colleague, Deputy Conlon, who had hoped to be present.  Unfortunately, she cannot attend due to illness.  She had intended to share time.Last night, I attended a meeting of North East Pylon Pressure, NEPP, in Monaghan.  Much anger and concern was expressed at the fact that EirGrid needed to withdraw its application from An Bord Pleanála on the 22nd day of the hearing because of errors in the public notices, something that should not have occurred.  The concern was at the prospect of needing to go through the whole procedure again, given the amount of time and expense involved, particularly on the part of members of the public with legitimate interests in this development.  Those at last night's meeting were anxious that Oireachtas Members would draw the Minister's attention to section 182 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and that the Act would be amended to ensure provision for legitimate expenses for members of the public with an interest who wish to give evidence.Will the Minister consider the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 given its apparent defect?  An Bord Pleanála does not need to validate applications, which local authorities must do when they receive applications for planning permission.  It is important that this matter be examined.  If An Bord Pleanála was obliged to validate an application, we would not be in a situation in which an application was withdrawn after a 22-day hearing.A great deal of time will pass before we get back to the point at which we left off last week at the hearing.  I hope that, during this time, everyone concerned will examine the rapidly developing technology to determine whether it is technically feasible and economically viable that the cable would be placed underground, as requested by me and my Fianna Fáil colleagues in counties Cavan, Meath and Monaghan in our submission to An Bord Pleanála.

Having dealt with EirGrid and its predecessor, the ESB, it is not a pleasant experience for any public group.  It is unforgivable that an error appeared in an advertisement taken out by a body such as EirGrid.  Under strategic planning legislation, the expectation would be that EirGrid would at least get its advertisements right.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has provided a long reply, but I will truncate it to suit the time allotted.The Government's overall policy objective is to ensure that energy is consistently available with minimal risk to supply disruption to meet the needs of businesses and domestic consumers.  No Deputy would argue against this objective.  The Minister has no direct role in the operational planning and construction of transmission systems,——
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	454	We got that first page previously.  The Minister of State can skip it if he wants.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	455	——which are operational matters for EirGrid, or in the planning process, which is a matter for An Bord Pleanála.EirGrid has been developing proposals for a 400 kV interconnection project from County Meath to County Tyrone.  It is a large interconnector.  This transmission and interconnection project is a key policy priority from a number of perspectives.  It will further consolidate the all-island single electricity market, with which every Deputy agrees, providing for the seamless transfer of electricity across the island of Ireland, delivering greater competition and reducing the need for further investment.  It will assist in the integration of renewable electricity and provide security of supply, new business opportunities and more sustainable energy.  It will also enhance competitiveness and opportunities for inward investment.EirGrid applied for planning consent for the development in December 2009 under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.  An Bord Pleanála convened an oral hearing on the matter in May 2010.  On Thursday, 24 June, it was drawn to EirGrid and the inspector's attention that there was an error in the newspaper public notice and site notice relating to pylon height ranges.  Full details of the correct heights of the towers concerned were fully described in the environmental impact statement, EIS, and in the accompanying planning drawings, but the error was in the advertisement.  Following consultation with its legal advisers, EirGrid was advised that, under the applicable legislation, there was no mechanism to correct the error within the context of the application.  When the original legislation was drafted, there was a presumption that statutory agencies like EirGrid would get something right.  EirGrid notified An Bord Pleanála on 29 June of the withdrawal of its application.  The Meath-Tyrone 400 kV interconnection project is of significant strategic importance from an all-island electricity market perspective.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has already made clear his strong disappointment that EirGrid has had to withdraw its planning consent application for this important development.EirGrid is undertaking a full review of the circumstances which led to the error in the public notice and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has asked to be fully informed of the findings of this review.  It is estimated that the total costs incurred by EirGrid on this project since 2006 are approximately €8 million.  EirGrid advises that most of this work remains valid and applicable to the new planning consent application and that the new application will largely reflect the original application.EirGrid has been working closely with its Northern Ireland counterpart, Northern Ireland Electricity, NIE, on development of this important strategic project.  The planning application for the Northern Ireland section of interconnection development project was submitted by NIE to Northern Ireland's Department of the Environment Planning Service in December 2009.  The Minister understands that the planning authorities in Northern Ireland are considering the application and the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me or Minister Ryan to comment on a live planning consent application in either jurisdiction.The two application processes are entirely separate and will be the subject of a separate decision in each jurisdiction.  The Minister is advised that EirGrid's revised application will largely reflect its original application, and it is not anticipated that the revised application should have any bearing on the Northern Ireland process.  While the Minister has no operational role in respect of transmission development or planning, he expects that EirGrid will work assiduously and quickly to prepare the new planning consent application, with a view to avoiding any further delays in progressing this important project.  Once the updated application is submitted, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority, in this case An Bord Pleanála, to bring the process to its conclusion, and the Minister cannot prejudge the outcome of the process.  As Deputies will be aware planning legislation is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the issue of costs borne by applicants or participants in any particular planning consent process are appropriate to that legislation.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources works closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the question of any amendments to the existing legislation is obviously a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is advised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that since the introduction of the Strategic Infrastructure Act in 2007 over 35 formal applications for major strategic infrastructure projects have been received with 26 now completed.  The overall rate of compliance with the statutory objective to decide these cases within 18 weeks is high, with nearly 70% of cases being determined within this period.I will pass the very specific points that Members have made to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and draw his attention to the points that were made, regarding the cost imposition in particular.  The point made by Deputy O'Hanlon as regards the delay perhaps being a mixed blessing in giving developing technology an opportunity to look at under-grounding, is particularly interesting.  In my view, however, it is unforgivable for a State agency such as EirGrid to make such a fundamental error as to get an advertisement wrong in a local newspaper.  That should not happen.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Táim an-bhuíoch don Cheann Comhairle tar éis deise a thabhairt domsa labhairt faoin scoil náisiúnta i gCnoc, Ros Cré, Contae Thiobraid Árann, ag smaoineamh é a oscailt arís.I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise the issue in relation to the proposal before the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan, at the moment to reopen Knock national school as a recognised school of status in the charming village of Knock, south east of Roscrea, County Tipperary.The parish of Kyle and Knock enjoyed the presence of a national school from 1900 until the 2003-04 school year when it was closed because of the rapid decline in numbers in the village and the surrounding areas of Knock.  However, the last census has shown an increase of 13% in the local population and as a result there is an urgent need to reopen this lovely building, which is in very good condition.  It is a school building that continues to serve the local community as a meeting place, and in recent times acted as a community crèche until the service provider saw fit, owing to the increased population, to move in 2003 and open a private state-of-the-art building.The empty building in the little village remains unused despite that in the school year 2011-12 it is envisaged that 32 children will be of school-going age and seeking to attend a school in their local area.  Plenty of research has been undertaken by a dedicated parents' committee, which has identified that these 32 children, at least, will have to find a school to attend.  Many schools in Roscrea are experiencing over-capacity as it is.There is a clear and strong case already on the Minister's desk for the reopening of this school, and its closure in 2003-04 is now seen to have been a temporary arrangement because of the decline in numbers.  Now the population figures present a strong case for its reopening and the parents' committee has fund-raised tirelessly to bring the building up to standard.  I took the opportunity recently to visit the building and see its condition at first hand.  It is a credit to the local community, with a tarmaced school yard, tennis courts and an impressive stone protective boundary wall.  The school lies at the heart of the four roads in the little village of Knock, Roscrea.It would be a small call on the Minister to give it the status it needs under section 11(4) of the Education Act 1998, whereby recognition may be restored to a school where the Minister sees fit and a patron takes on the responsibility to act in patronage.  The Bishop of Killaloe has stated his commitment to repatronise that school, should the Minister see fit to open it.  The request is for two teachers to be installed for the school year 2011-12, with 32 pupils ready for attendance and where a very small amount of refurbishment work is required, which could be undertaken by a community employment scheme that would restore the school to a very high standard.  This is necessary to restore the laughter, music and games associated with any school yard in a rural village.I believe this is a very reasonable request.  It has been before the Minister for some months, and I am asking that she seriously considers the reopening of the school.  We hear a good deal about sustainable rural development.  I believe this request is a typical example, where we want to see populations remaining in rural areas.  It is compatible with Government policy to see the growth of villages, and the development of hurling and camogie teams as well as all types of activities that are integral to the nature of rural communities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I thank Deputy Hoctor for her very heartfelt presentation.  I have a response from the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills but, unfortunately, it does not contain the positive response the Deputy was hoping to elicit.  I will pass on the Deputy's well made and sincere comments to the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills who, for family reasons, cannot be in the Chamber tonight.The Department of Education and Skills took the decision to close Knock national school at the end of the 2002-2003 school year because of the downward trend in enrolments with no prospect of a reversal in the decline at the time.  Numbers dropped from 37 pupils in 1993-1994 to three pupils in 2002-2003.  The decision to close the school under rule 36 of rules for national schools was taken after consultation with the patron, the school's chairperson, the local school's inspector and the INTO.In taking this decision the Department was aware there was sufficient school accommodation in the area to cater for the numbers of preschool children in the area.  Representations on behalf of the school concerned, seeking to have recognition restored, have recently been made to the Department by local and other elected representatives, including Deputy Hoctor.The forward planning section in the Department utilises the latest in geographical information systems, GIS, technology to assist in planning school requirements.  The GIS contains information on all schools in the country, at both primary and post-primary level.  Utilising GIS, the forward planning section has carried out a national study to identify areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection, in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.The study indicates the requirements for additional primary provision in the coming years is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.The forward planning section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis of over 40 locations of highest population growth to identify the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014-2015.  When the required reports have been completed, the section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country.The sting, however, is in the tail.  Initial demographic analysis on the Roscrea area indicates there will be no requirement for significant additional accommodation in the short to medium term.  It is not envisaged that Knock national school will be re-opened.I wish to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Knowing Deputy Hoctor as I do, I have no doubt as to the sincerity of the case she has presented.  I will make the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills aware of the concerns of the people Deputy Hoctor so ably represents on this issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Ireland takes an active interest in the successful resolution of the Cyprus question. The UN has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement and the Government fully supports the leadership of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Representative Alexander Downer in this important work.We will continue to encourage progress towards the achievement of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal state through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic rights of all Cypriots.  We encourage Turkey to bring its influence to bear in supporting a durable settlement — something I discussed with the Turkish Foreign Minister in the course of our meeting in Dublin on 10 March.The current phase of negotiations to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem began in September 2008, under the auspices of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Alexander Downer.  By the end of March 2010, over 70 rounds of talks had taken place between President Christofias, the leader of the Greek Cypriots, and Mehmet Ali Talat, the then leader of the Turkish Cypriot community.As Deputies will be aware, Mr Dervis Eroglu was elected leader of the Turkish Cypriot community in the elections held on 18 April, defeating Mr. Talat. A first round of talks between President Christofias and Mr. Eroglu took place at the end of May. Given the negative positions previously taken by Mr. Eroglu on the negotiations, it was encouraging that the two leaders could agree to continue the talks on the basis of the UN parameters, Security Council resolutions and the landmark joint statements made by Christofias and Talat during their talks in 2008. The two leaders held a further round of talks on 23 June, when discussions focused on property issues. The next meeting between Mr. Eroglu and Mr. Christofias will be held on 9 July.Both sides have said that they wish to find a solution by the end of 2010. While much needs to be done before agreement can be reached, I believe that the necessary momentum is present.Regarding property rights in Northern Cyprus: in the case of Demopoulos v. Turkey in March this year the European Court of Human Rights determined that the Immovable Property Commission (IPC) provided an accessible and effective framework of redress in respect of complaints about interference with property owned by Greek Cypriots. This Commission was set up in 2005 by the Turkish Cypriot community as a means of recourse for displaced Greek Cypriots.There have been previous judgments, including the interstate case of Cyprus v. Turkey, which have been transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, responsible for supervising the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe met in June to discuss the implications of the Demopoulos decision and whether it could conclude that Turkey had now implemented fully that part of the Cyprus v. Turkey judgment dealing with property rights of displaced persons. Cyprus opposed closure of this matter and raised a number of questions which it felt ought to be addressed prior to adopting a final closure resolution on this aspect of the Cyprus v. Turkey case. A number of states, including Ireland, felt that questions raised by Cyprus merited a response and asked the Council of Europe Secretariat, responsible for advising the Committee of Ministers on the execution of judgments, for further information and clarification before making a decision on closure. The Committee of Ministers will meet again in September to consider the matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Under the Government's decentralisation programme announced in 2003, the headquarters of Irish Aid, the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has moved to Limerick.The decentralisation of Irish Aid is fully complete and is making an important contribution to the economy of Limerick and the Mid-West region.  It also contributes to civic life in the area through events such as the annual Africa Day celebration.The development programme is recognised as one of the best in the world.  This was highlighted by a peer review of Irish Aid carried out by the OECD and published in April 2009.  The OECD reported that "Irish Aid is a strong, cutting edge, development cooperation programme, fully integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs".  It stated that "Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective".The report of the peer review is a thorough and detailed document, providing a very positive assessment of the impact, effectiveness and focus of the aid programme.  It was based on work conducted while decentralisation was being completed and represents the most authoritative and impartial international assessment which an aid programme can receive.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The Government welcomes the new Strategy which was adopted by the European Council on 17 June and fully supports the core elements as they have been agreed . We believe that the Strategy will provide an essential framework for action by the EU and its Member States to achieve higher levels of sustainable jobs and growth as economic recovery is secured.We are very satisfied with the broad thrust of the five EU headline targets which the European Council have agreed upon, which are: to raise to 75% the employment for women and men aged 20 — 64; raising investment in research and development, including innovation to 3% of GDP; reducing greenhouse gases by 20% compared with 1990 levels; increasing the share of renewable in energy consumption to 20% and working towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency; improving education levels by reducing the school drop-out rates to 10% and increasing the share of 30 — 40 year-olds having completed tertiary or equivalent education to at least 40%; and promoting social inclusion, in particular through reduction of poverty by aiming to lift at least 20 million people out of risk of poverty.  As I have mentioned before, we have already exceeded the 40% target for tertiary education and are close to the 10% drop-out rate target at 11.3%.This choice of targets is consistent with the desire to keep the Strategy focused on key policies which can be mobilised to unlock the growth potential of the European Union. The targets on greenhouse gas reduction and increasing the share of renewables had already been agreed by the European Council in the context of the EU's negotiating position in the UN Conference on Climate Change. The targets also have the added potential for inter-linkage, where progress under one target can contribute to reaching another. In particular, we welcome the conclusions agreed by the European Council on this new Strategy which noted that "a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the new Strategy, considering the growth and employment potential; of rural areas while ensuring fair competition". We believe that this provides a most useful platform on which to build linkages between this Strategy and the agriculture and food sector.The Strategy will provide an essential framework for action by the EU and its Member States to achieve higher levels of sustainable jobs and growth as economic recovery is secured. We now look forward to the implementation of the Strategy at Member State and EU level. Over the months ahead, we will be taking the necessary measures at national level, supported as appropriate, by action at EU level, to set this ten year Strategy in motion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 377 together.The establishment of a Certificate of Irish Heritage was proposed in the Strategic Review of Ireland-US Relations, published in March 2009.  The initiative is being taken forward by the Government in direct response to a strong demand for such a scheme among those members of our Diaspora who are not entitled to Irish citizenship and is a practical demonstration of the inclusive approach adopted by successive Governments when it comes to defining the Irish identity.The Certificate of Irish Heritage will give official recognition to the many people worldwide who are conscious of their Irish heritage and feel a strong affinity for Ireland, but who are not eligible for Irish citizenship.  The Certificate will not confer any citizenship or other legal rights or entitlements to the successful applicant.My Department published a request on the Government's eTenders website in April seeking expressions of interest from suitably qualified service providers for the establishment of a service concession to operate the service on behalf of the Department.  A deadline of 28 May was set for the receipt of applications.  Expressions of interest were received from a number of interested service providers and are currently under consideration.Those applying for Certificates of Irish Heritage will be required to submit comprehensive details of their Irish ancestral connections and relevant documents and certificates to show their connection with Ireland.  As the tender process for the award of the licence to operate the service is ongoing, I am not in a position to provide details on those companies that may have applied or the fee that is expected to be charged for the service. It is hoped that the scheme will be operational by the end of the year.Although it is not possible to put a figure on the number of people who may apply for the Certificate, it is expected that there will be a substantial demand abroad for the service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	462	It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of a true American statesman, a hero to the state of West Virginia, and a true friend to the island of Ireland, Senator Robert C. Byrd. In this regard, I would like to note the Senator's support for the International Fund for Ireland, during his time as Chair of the Senate's Appropriations Committee.Throughout his 52 years in Congress, Senator Byrd had a front row seat to some of America's most memorable moments. Whether it was the assassination of a beloved President, the landing of a man on the moon, or the tragedies of September 11th, Robert Byrd was at hand to lead and to serve not just the people of West Virginia, but the citizens of the United States.He was never a man to sacrifice his own personal beliefs for the sake of political gain. He would often courageously voice his opinion, with candour, while dedicated to the principles of the US Constitution. As the Deputy notes in his question, this was particularly so in the clear stance Senator Byrd took on Iraq. He was one of the few to change his own views on race relations in America. In the words of President Obama, "He had the courage to stand firm in his principles, but also the courage to change over time.”Robert Byrd's talents didn't just end in the halls of Congress. Apart from being the longest serving member of the United States Congress, he would often showcase his talents as a fiddle player. Senator Byrd played some of the most famous venues in America, including the Kennedy Centre — even releasing an album while he was Majority Leader.President Obama referred to the Senator as "uniquely American”, a more fitting description I think you could not find. On behalf of the Irish Government, I wish to extend our condolences to his family. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughters, their grandchildren and great grandchildren, and all the people of West Virginia who loved and cherished Robert C. Byrd. May he rest in peace.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 53, 79 and 396 together.While much attention has rightly been concentrated on the recent events surrounding Gaza and their aftermath, it is crucial that we continue to focus on the efforts needed to reach a comprehensive political settlement. Ultimately this is the only way to fully achieve our goals of ending the occupation and its inherent injustices, ending the isolation of Gaza, and providing for the long-term peace and security of both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.The proximity talks under the chairmanship of Senator Mitchell commenced in May and are expected to continue for a period of four months, after this the parties will consider the basis for continuing them, or indeed progressing to direct talks, which we would all hope will be possible.The key issues are borders (including the question of Jerusalem), security, refugees and water. These are difficult issues, but they have been debated for decades now, many ideas and visions have been put forward and the parties have a broad understanding of each others' needs and positions. I believe that these issues are all capable of being resolved, within the two year timeframe set out by President Obama, if the parties are genuinely willing to find solutions.The process initially involves Israel and the Palestinian Authority but in due course, if progress allows, the wider issues of Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and general Israeli-Arab relations will need to be addressed as well if we are to attain settlement.We are all very well aware of the mutual distrust and lack of confidence on the part of both the parties that the other is genuinely serious. We are also aware of and concerned by the possibilities of events on the ground derailing the process, intentionally or otherwise. The Irish Government strongly supports the EU, President Obama and his Administration, and the Quartet in their efforts to urge all parties to engage seriously, to refrain from negative acts on the ground, to be mindful of the needs of the other protagonists, and to do all in their power to achieve a final settlement of this destructive conflict.I would commend in this respect the efforts of President Abbas to speak to the Israeli media, and thus to the Israeli people in order to set out his vision for a shared and peaceful future. I am struck by the contrast between this example of real leadership, and the dead end represented by some elements of Hamas who seem to be fixated on destroying the facilities built by UNRWA for the childrens' Summer Games in Gaza.Ireland, with our EU partners, will continue to encourage and support the parties in their engagement with each other, and to consider any and all practical steps we can take to help the process, bearing in mind that we need to be ready to assist over the long haul. Ireland will also remain focussed, directly and at EU and UN levels, on the key human rights and justice issues which continue to affect the daily lives of the people of Gaza and the other Occupied Territories, and which have the potential to derail political efforts.I agree absolutely that the continuing relentless process of settlement expansion and squeezing out of Palestinian families, especially in Jerusalem — which is continuing even if there has been some slowing of the pace this year — is both dangerous and incomprehensible, against a background where both sides are supposed to be committed to reaching a final settlement of borders within a short period.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The Government's aid programme, administered from within my department by Irish Aid, is sharply focused on the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger.  Our partnership with development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionaries represents a very important element in this effort, reflecting the broad support among Irish people for the development programme.  The Irish aid programme channels over 20% of overall assistance through NGOs and missionaries, one of the highest proportions internationally.Funding for NGOs is administered through a range of funding schemes covering long term development, emergency and recovery assistance and development education.  Additional funding is provided to NGOs under the development programmes in the nine priority countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Irish Aid also cooperates closely with the representative group Misean Cara, providing very significant funding for the work of Irish missionaries with poor communities in the developing world.In 2009, the Government provided a total of €696 million for Official Development Assistance.  €571 million of this was provided under Vote 29 (International Co-Operation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the aid programme managed by Irish Aid.  Of this amount, over €152 million was channelled through development NGOs and missionaries, to support their work in livelihood and food security, rural economic development, health, education, gender equality and humanitarian response programmes.The overall ODA allocation which the Government has provided for 2010 involves a relatively small reduction of €25 million on the total for 2009.  As a result, it is likely that the outturn for 2010 will show some reduction in funding for NGOs.  However, the precise amount will depend on appraisal and approval processes which are still underway.  I can confirm that the amount of funding provided to the five main NGO partners for long term development work and to Misean Cara will remain at the same level as 2009:  Concern, Trócaire, Goal, Self Help Africa and Christian Aid will receive a total of €56 million for this purpose, and Misean Cara will receive €16 million.It will be necessary this year to limit the number of new projects funded, while honouring the multi-annual commitments to NGO partners.  As a number of NGO projects have reached the end of their funding cycles with Irish Aid, it will be possible to release some funding for new projects this year.  Proposals from NGOs are currently under consideration and I expect that the details of successful candidates will be announced after the summer.The Government is determined that our aid programme will maintain its focus on poverty and hunger, and that we will continue to strengthen our partnership with civil society, and our concentration on achieving clear development results.  This partnership goes beyond funding arrangements, and involves continuous policy dialogue across a range of vital issues, to ensure that the overall Irish contribution to development has the maximum effect on the lives of the poorest people in the world.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Iceland applied for membership of the EU in July 2009.  On 24 February, the Commission delivered a largely positive opinion (avis) on Iceland’s readiness to begin accession negotiations and recommended that a date should be set for commencement of talks. In light of the Commission opinion the application was considered by Foreign Ministers at the General Affairs Council on 14 June and by Heads of State and Government at the European Council on 17 June 2010.  The European Council decided that accession negotiations should be opened and invited the Council to adopt a general Negotiating Framework.The Negotiating Framework will set out the broad principles, parameters and negotiating procedures governing the talks with Iceland.  The Commission has prepared an initial draft of the Framework and this will be discussed by Member States at working group level over the coming weeks.  The final draft will then be submitted to the General Affairs Council for approval and the Council will then set a date for the commencement of the formal talks.Iceland is a country with which we have strong ties of geography, history, culture and politics.  It is already closely integrated with the EU in several areas, through its membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen area, all of which should facilitate the process of negotiating in some areas.As in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted.  Some of the areas to be covered in the negotiations will present challenges both for Iceland and for some existing member states.  I am confident that workable solutions can be found. The outcome of negotiations must, as I say, be awaited but the possible accession of Iceland is something I would regard as a positive development.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I have received a number of appeals in relation to the situation of the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, most recently in connection with the murder of over 90 members of that community in Lahore as they worshipped in two mosques in the city on 28 May.I have condemned these murders on a number of occasions in this House, just as I now condemn the murders of innocent civilians in the attack on a Sufi shrine in Lahore last week.  Nothing can justify attacks which cause such senseless carnage and destruction.  On my own behalf, and on behalf of the Government, I once again extend my deepest sympathies to the bereaved families on their great loss.These attacks bring to public attention once again the threats which exist to the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, the discrimination they can face there and in neighbouring countries, and issues relating to other minority communities more broadly.Promoting religious tolerance remains a key objective of Ireland and the EU in relation to Pakistan.  Bilaterally, and through the EU, we have urged the Government there to make every effort to promote effectively the rights of minorities and to improve their current conditions.  In our bilateral contact with Pakistan, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining adequate protections for minorities in Pakistan.  Minority and human rights issues in that country were discussed at political consultations held between Ireland and Pakistan at Political Director level in Islamabad on 10 February last.  The issue of the recent attacks has been raised with the Embassy of Pakistan and my Department will continue to discuss issues relating to minorities in its ongoing bilateral contacts with Pakistan.At EU level, Council Conclusions of 28 April and 8 December 2008 reaffirmed the importance of human rights in Pakistan as a central priority for the EU.  Human rights and minority issues are regularly discussed with Pakistan, most recently at the second EU-Pakistan Summit held in Brussels on 4 June.The Government of Pakistan has made it clear that it is committed to the protection of minorities, the promotion of religious tolerance and combating the terrorist actions of the local Taliban and other radicals.  However, it faces very serious challenges in this regard.  Many hundreds of innocent Pakistani civilians from many parts of the country, from many tribal and religious groups and from all levels in society have fallen victim to terrorists.  In the case of the attacks on the Ahmadiyya community on 28 May, I note that the Punjab wing of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility and that the police are reported to have arrested seven men with alleged links to this group.  There are also reports that a further two persons suspected of having taken part in the attacks were arrested in Lahore on 2 June and remain in custody.The EU has pledged to assist the Government of Pakistan in its efforts to fight terrorism. In this context, leaders at the EU-Pakistan Summit on the 4 June agreed to further strengthen cooperation between the EU and Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, both within the framework of the United Nations as well as in other relevant forums.  The EU and Pakistan also reiterated that counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and should be implemented in full respect of international law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The Government has provided assistance to Timor-Leste through Irish Aid since 2000.  In March 2003, Timor -Leste was designated a programme country, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  The Conflict Resolution Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs has been working with Timor-Leste since 2008, assisted by Ireland's Special Envoy, Nuala O'Loan.In 2009, Ireland provided a total of €4.5 million in support to Timor-Leste, covering development activities and conflict resolution efforts. We are providing a similar level of funding this year.This year, Ireland has completed a new Country Strategy for assistance to Timor Leste, for the period 2010-2013.  This is an integrated strategy, bringing together development work and conflict resolution in one coherent programme. In developing the new programme, lessons have been learned from the experience of working in Timor-Leste over the past decade.  The overall goal is to contribute to building peace and reducing poverty through three interlinked areas of assistance. Ireland will provide support for the development of basic infrastructure such as roads and bridges in rural areas, which will help create much-needed employment through private sector contractors.  We will also help make government more accountable to its citizens through support for elections, building civil society and increasing the participation of women in politics. Finally, the programme will help strengthen peace-building in Timor Leste through support for remembrance and reconciliation efforts, developing systems to provide early warning of conflict, building political and community dialogue and assisting with security sector reform.Despite the many challenges facing the people of Timor-Leste, important progress is being made in building a democratic system of government, with effective, accountable institutions. When I met President Ramos-Horta during his State Visit to Ireland in March, I assured him of our continuing commitment to working in partnership with government and local communities in Timor-Leste in support of their long-term development goals.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Government remains in close and regular contact with the British Government about the range of ongoing issues which are the legacy of the Troubles.On 13 May, I visited Ballymurphy where the relatives of the eleven innocent people killed there between the 9 and 11 August 1971 took to the locations in the area at which their loved ones were killed. My visit was at the invitation of the families as agreed at my earlier meeting with them in January 2009. On both occasions, the relatives told me of their demand for an international, independent investigation, a demand I undertook to relay to the British Government.  The families made similar views known to my colleague, Dermot Ahern, Minister for Justice & law reform, when they met with him in November 2008. My officials are in ongoing contact with the families and their representatives.I have raised the relatives' case directly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, as I also did with his predecessor, Shaun Woodward. With both of them, I reiterated the Government's strong support for the Ballymurphy families.  I understand that, since we last spoke on the matter, Secretary of State Paterson has confirmed his intention to meet with representatives of the families in the coming weeks.As the Deputy is aware, the Ballymurphy families are not alone in seeking answers and justice for loved ones lost during the Troubles. Lord Saville's report into the events of Bloody Sunday, published last month, provided welcome relief and vindication for the families of those killed and injured on that dreadful day. Its success in doing so has, naturally, raised the question of how the needs of other victims might best be addressed.This Government has consistently maintained that there should be no hierarchy of victims. Just as families in Ballymurphy are looking for information about how their loved ones were killed, there are families across the North and, indeed, in this jurisdiction, who lost loved ones in the many other atrocities of the conflict who are anxious to find out more about how their loved ones were killed. The challenge that political leaders in these islands face is finding a way for all of those people to get the answers they need.Dealing with the terrible legacy of the conflict in the North will not be a single or a simple task. How to address this is a significant challenge for all those with a stakeholding in building a better, shared future, including political leaders.Last year we saw the report of the Consultative Group on the Past presented to the Secretary of State. Its recommendations were wide ranging and have been much studied and commented on in the months since. The debate which that report provoked was a clear sign that dealing with the legacy of the Troubles will not be an easy task but it is one that is vital. The British Government has not yet responded to the formal consultation on Eames Bradley and I understand, following on from publication of the Saville report, the Secretary of State is intending to consult further on this whole question.Last week, the Commission for Victims and Survivors presented a paper to the Secretary of State and to the First and deputy First Ministers on dealing with the past. I look forward to meeting with the Commissioners tomorrow to hear from them about their proposals.As the Deputy himself said in this House last week during the debate on the Saville report “
We remember all the victims of the conflict without exception and sympathise with all the bereaved
.”   I fully agree. It is for all those victims and their relatives that we must continue to work with the British Government and with the Executive to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.

To date, twenty-four former detainees have been received by EU Member States. I understand that in the case of certain Member States, the consideration of whether or not to accept detainees is ongoing.Two former detainees have been received for resettlement in Ireland. They arrived in Ireland in late September 2009.Together with our EU partners, Ireland continues to encourage the US to bring about the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in the shortest possible time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I visited Uganda from 27-30 June. The key objectives of my trip were to visit Irish Aid funded development projects and programmes, and to strengthen Irish-Ugandan bilateral and trade relations.  Uganda is one of nine priority countries for the Government's aid programme. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 157 out of 182 countries on the UN's Human Development Index.During my visit I met with 10 Government Ministers including Prime Minister Nsibambi and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Education, to discuss political and development issues. Discussions focussed on key governance issues, human rights, economic and social development and the prospects for the economy in the light of the development of major oil and gas fields. I also had valuable discussions with the Ugandan Human Rights Commissioner and we reviewed both the progress which Uganda has made in human rights and the undoubted challenges that remain.  I also met with the Inspector General of Police in relation to assistance that has been requested in community policing from the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.During my visit, I launched our new Country Strategy for Uganda (2010-2014) which sets out our priorities for the next few years. The Country Strategy has a strong focus on reducing chronic poverty among some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in Uganda. Key areas of support will be: HIV and AIDS activities, education, gender, strengthening good governance, private sector development and support for Karamoja, which is one of the poorest and most marginalised regions in Uganda.In line with the priorities set out in our Country Strategy, I visited the Karamoja region with Mrs. Janet Museveni, Minister of State for Karamoja and First Lady of Uganda, to officially launch Ireland's new programme of assistance for that region.  To date, Irish Aid has helped to rehabilitate 11 primary schools and 2 teacher training colleges in Karamoja which has created some 2,000 additional student places. In addition, educational bursaries have been provided to 1,000 students. During my visit to the region, I also visited a local secondary school and opened a new wing which has been funded by Irish Aid. I can confirm that Ireland continues to work with the most vulnerable and marginalised in one of the most difficult operating environments in the world.While in Kampala, I was pleased to open a new Centre of Excellence for Palliative Care, which has been part funded by Irish Aid. I also met with representatives of NGOs and Irish missionaries working on the ground and took the opportunity to thank them for their work, which is a source of great pride to the people of Ireland. Finally, I met with members of the local Irish community and Irish business people who are developing business opportunities in Uganda's growing private sector.My visit has helped enhance Ireland's bilateral and trade relations with Uganda, which is one of our key partner countries in Africa and one in which there has been enormous progress in the last 25 years. It also provided me with an opportunity to see at first hand the real difference Ireland's development assistance programme is making to the lives of ordinary people in Uganda, and to reaffirm Ireland's commitment to reducing poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries in the world. It also afforded me an insight into the real potential of Uganda, if its resources are husbanded and managed carefully, to become a middle income country within a generation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 65,  81 and 83 together.Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, as well as the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination. UN Secretary General Ban's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, is continuing his efforts to convene direct negotiations between the two sides, following the last such discussions held in March 2008.In an attempt to resume contact this year, Mr. Ross hosted a second round of informal discussions in New York in February following an initial round held in Austria in August 2009, but unfortunately he has had to report that so far there has been no real engagement between the two sides, Morocco and the Polisario, in resolving the outstanding issues. The major issue is Morocco's refusal to allow a Referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara. This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum. Mr. Ross visited the region in the early part of this year, and reported back to the UN Security Council in some detail.Issues pertaining to the Western Sahara are regularly raised at EU level within the framework of the EU-Morocco dialogue. The most recent EU — Morocco Summit took place in Granada on the 7 March.  The EU conveyed its concerns over the situation of Western Sahara as well as the need to safeguard the rights of both Moroccan and Saharawi human rights defenders, and these concerns were reflected in the joint statement after the meeting.The EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement which was adopted in May 2006 is primarily the responsibility of the Agriculture Council of Ministers. The Agreement is of substantial economic importance to a number of our EU partners.  The Agreement relates to Moroccan waters, and while Morocco considers that the Western Sahara and its waters is Moroccan, the EU does not accept this position.As Morocco controls the territory and their waters, however, there is no practical way to ensure that fishing vessels do not follow the stocks — which move up and down the coast — into Saharan waters.Ireland and other EU Member States worked to ensure that language was included in the agreement to make clear that it was without prejudice to the EU's position on the status of the Western Sahara, while Ireland also made a National Declaration at the time of adoption reiterating that the agreement was conditional on this.Three members of the Permanent Defence Forces serve in an observer capacity with the MINURSO mission. Ireland has maintained such a presence with the mission since 1991, when the mission was established under UNSCR 690.Ireland's Permanent Representation to the United Nations and the Department of Defence monitor and engage, as appropriate, on matters relating to MINURSO on an ongoing basis. Resolution 1920, adopted by the Security Council on 30 April 2010, extended the mandate of MINURSO until 30 April 2011. The Security Council considered a proposal to include human rights monitoring in the mandate of MINURSO, but did not include this in the renewed mandate. The UN Secretary General has reiterated his call that all parties should remain engaged in continuous and constructive dialogue with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), with a view to ensuring respect for the human rights of the people of Western Sahara, both inside the Territory and in the refugee camps.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The practice of female genital mutilation is a clear violation of the human rights of women and girls.  It has serious social, health and psychological consequences, and it infringes on children's rights to special protection. The World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of female genital mutilation. In Africa alone, it is estimated that three million girls are at risk annually.Ireland is playing an active role in global policy development, funding and research to address this appalling practice.  We recognise that it is a form of gender-based violence, and that it must be an important element in our comprehensive approach to tackling such violence through the overseas aid programme.  The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid includes a firm commitment that Ireland will build its support for measures focused on preventing and responding to gender-based violence.Irish Aid, the Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs which manages the Government's aid programme, is a founding member of the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence, which brings together representatives from Government Departments and Irish development, humanitarian and human rights Non-Governmental Organisations to promote a coordinated response to all forms of gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation.Internationally, we are cooperating with United Nations agencies in a concerted effort to end the practice of female genital mutilation.  Last year, the Government provided core funding of €8 million to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and €3 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support their work on child protection, gender equality, reproductive health, maternal mortality and HIV and AIDS.  We are providing funding at the same levels for 2010.  These agencies operate a joint programme to counter female genital mutilation with the aim of ending the practice in seventeen countries by 2012.  Ireland contributed €0.5 million to this specific programme in 2007.  In addition, in 2009 a total of €1.1 million was provided specifically for support to gender equality and women's empowerment, including through support for the UN Trust Fund for actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women.Progress is being made towards ending the practice of female genital mutilation, but detailed international coordination and consultation remains essential.  On 6 February 2010, the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation, UNICEF and the UNFPA reported that there has been success in reducing the incidence of the practices in several countries where it was once prevalent.  They noted that it is important to focus on encouraging change from within societies, and that where communities have chosen to make public declarations against the practice, for example in Senegal, declines of up to 65 per cent have been recorded.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 70 and 74 together.The outbreak of ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan earlier this month left hundreds dead and thousands injured.  I join with those who have condemned this violence.  I also offer my condolences to the families of those killed and my sympathy to those who were injured or displaced.The violence in Kyrgyzstan resulted in a serious humanitarian crisis.  Tens of thousands of ethnic Uzbeks crossed the border into Uzbekistan while thousands more were displaced within Kyrgyzstan itself.  The international community and NGOs responded quickly to the crisis.  The OSCE, UN and EU have been working together effectively on the ground to help stabilise the situation and provide urgent humanitarian assistance in both Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.Irish Aid has responded to the crisis through a contribution of €250,000 to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and an airlift of 2,650 blankets and water tanks from its emergency stockpiles.  A member of Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps has also been deployed to work as a Protection Officer with the UNHCR in Kyrgyzstan.  The European Commission provided €5m in emergency aid.  The Commission is also refocusing its €6m stabilisation and democratisation support package for Kyrgyzstan to address current challenges such as institutional reform and inter-ethnic relations.Despite the violence and humanitarian crisis, the planned referendum went ahead on 27 June.  The referendum proposed a new constitution and the confirmation of the appointment of Ms Roza Otunbayeva as Acting President.  Provisional results indicate that the proposal was approved by a large majority.  Turnout is estimated to have been in the region of 70%.  The OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which sent a limited mission to observe the vote, noted the peaceful conduct of the election, as well as the high turnout, despite the challenging circumstances.  High Representative Ashton, on behalf of the EU, welcomed the peaceful conduct of the vote saying it marks "an important step towards the re-establishment of constitutional order and democratic process in the country".While the situation in Kyrgyzstan has stabilised, and many of those who fled to Uzbekistan appear to be returning, assistance from the international community will be required for some time.  The EU and regional organisations such as the OSCE are now considering ways in which to help Kyrgyzstan overcome both the immediate crisis and to meet its medium and long-term challenges.  Ireland will play its part in this process.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 58 together.The recent gas dispute between Belarus and Russia appears to be moving towards a resolution and I understand that supplies into Belarus have resumed.Although the dispute did not have any impact on Ireland, we kept the situation under close review through our participation in the EU's Gas Coordination Group.  This expert group, which meets in Brussels, is chaired by the European Commission and consists of representatives from all EU Member States and the European gas industry.  Its purpose is to monitor the gas security situation within the EU on an ongoing basis and to coordinate the EU's response to events such as the Russia and Belarus gas dispute.At a meeting of the Gas Coordination Group on 18 June, Member States were briefed on the unfolding situation between Russia and Belarus by both the Energy and External Relations Directorates of the Commission.  Reports were also received from Poland and Lithuania, the EU Member States for which Belarus provides transit for imports of Russian gas.  Daily updates were subsequently provided to Member States.  I understand that gas flows to Poland and Lithuania have now returned to normal.The Russia/Belarus gas dispute again illustrates the importance of energy security for the EU and why this issue remains at the top of the EU agenda.  A key driver for action to strengthen EU energy security was the experience of the Russia/Ukraine gas crisis in January 2009.  Since then the EU's ability to respond quickly to potential gas supply problems has been strengthened significantly.  In recent weeks agreement has been reached on a new EU regulation for security of gas supply.  The aim of the new regulation is to increase the security of gas supply within the EU by ensuring each Member State has an adequate level of preparedness for a gas disruption.  The regulation will greatly enhance cooperation across the EU in all aspects of planning for, and response to, a disruption to gas supply.While the recent Russia/Belarus situation has not impacted adversely on Ireland, it does remind us that other parts of the EU gas market can experience volatility.  As it now appears to have been resolved no impact is expected on our gas prices this winter.All of this takes place within the political context of the EU's efforts to enhance relations with both its eastern partners and Russia leading to an environment where disputes can be addressed in a constructive atmosphere.  In this regard, I welcome the significant improvements we have seen in the EU's relationship with Russia, as evidenced by the more positive atmosphere at recent EU-Russia Summits.  I also welcome the ongoing development of the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative which was launched in Prague in May 2009.  The Eastern Partnership aims to enhance the EU's relations with our eastern neighbours, including Belarus, and provides a mechanism through which we can help support domestic reform and economic development.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	475	The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid included a commitment to the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Development, to be chaired at Ministerial level.  The Committee, which is currently chaired by Minister of State Power, was launched in April 2007 with the objective of strengthening coherence in the Government's approach to development and making best use of the expertise and skills available across the public service.  It has become a key forum for the sharing of knowledge and views on development issues across Government Departments. The Committee is working to ensure that a strong development perspective is integrated into Government decision-making in all relevant areas, including trade, which is vital to developing countries' efforts to end poverty and eradicate the scourge of global hunger.The Inter-Departmental Committee has met eleven times to date and has held discussions on a wide range of development policy issues. These have included the report and recommendations of the Government's Hunger Task Force; the impact of climate change on development; the views of Non-Governmental Organisations on improving policy coherence for development; Ireland's engagement with the Bretton Woods Institutions; health issues in the context of development; other countries' experience in developing a more integrated approach to development issues; the findings and recommendations of the OECD peer review of the Irish aid programme; and the upcoming Millennium Development Goals Review Summit in September.At each meeting, the Committee has received reports on developments at EU level and on the ongoing work on policy coherence for development within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Two Sub-Groups have been established, and report regularly to the Committee.  The Sub-Group on Multilateral Organisations focuses on the development of a coherent inter-Departmental policy approach for Ireland's participation in international meetings on development, particularly at the United Nations.  The Sub-Group on Skills Sets is examining how to make best use across Ireland's development programme of the range of skills and expertise available throughout the public service.Ireland's international development policy is strongly focused on the fight against global poverty and the eradication of hunger. In this respect, the Government seeks to ensure that the development of global trade builds economic growth and contributes effectively to the reduction, and eventual eradication, of extreme poverty in developing countries. Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs, works closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on trade and development issues, including in discussions at EU level and at the World Trade Organisation.The Government is committed to ensuring that the close cooperation between relevant Government Departments which has developed under the Inter-Departmental Committee is maintained and strengthened so that the full range of policies, including on trade issues, supports the long term objective of eradicating poverty and hunger among the world's poorest people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The European External Action Service (EEAS) is an important innovation under the Lisbon Treaty to support the work of the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton.The functions of the EEAS will focus on the High Representative's mandate to conduct the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and to ensure the consistency of the EU's external action. The EEAS will also have functions relating to the High Representative's role as President of the new Foreign Affairs Council and in respect of her role as a Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for external relations and for coordinating other aspects of the EU's external action. An important instrument in carrying out its role will be the network of Union delegations which the EEAs will maintain in third countries.As indicated in my reply to a question on 20 May, Ministers reached a broad political understanding at the April General Affairs Council on the essential elements of a Council Decision which will establish the organisation and functioning of the EEAS.  Subsequent discussions with representatives of the Parliament have concluded recently and some amendments to the draft Council Decision have been proposed in light of those discussions.  On this basis, it is hoped that agreement can be reached on the Council Decision at the July General Affairs Council.The Treaty provides that the EEAS will comprise officials from relevant departments of the Commission and the Council Secretariat, as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the Member States. The process for recruiting staff from these three sources will be laid out in the Council Decision but appropriate amendments to the EU's Staff Regulations will also be required and it is hoped that these amendments can be finalised in September.Ireland has consistently pressed for the EEAS recruitment process to be open, transparent and merit-based, while also ensuring that EEAS staffing is representative of the diversity of the Union. I welcome the fact that these principles are reflected in the draft Council Decision. If agreement is reached at the July Council on the Council Decision, the High Representative can begin the process for recruitment to the EEAS although actual recruitment must await the relevant amendments to the Staff Regulations.Irish candidates will be able to compete for positions within the EEAS on an equal footing with candidates from other Member States and from the EU institutions. My Department has sought general expressions of interest from its officers who might consider working for the EEAS and has received a very positive response. However, it is not possible to say at this stage how many Irish staff will serve in the EEAS as the overall size of the EEAS is still under consideration and it will be some years before it reaches full operational strength.Staffing from the member States, including Ireland, is likely to start more slowly than from the EU institutions but a target has been set to have one third of the EEAS staff coming from the diplomatic services of the Member States by 1 July 2013. The High Representative has indicated that she intends to achieve this target on a phased basis over the next three years.I expect there will be tangible benefits to the State from the experience which will be gained by Irish officials serving on rotation with the EEAS and returning to the Irish diplomatic service. I look forward to Irish candidates of the highest calibre being recruited into the new Service.Before the EEAS recruitment begins formally, the process of appointing Heads of EU Delegations — formerly Commission Delegations — has already been opened to candidates from the diplomatic services of the Member States. I understand that a number of Irish candidates, including officers from my own Department, have applied for these posts, of which 34 are due to be filled this year. Applicants were subject to a preselection process and the remaining candidates are currently being assessed by interview panels on which Member States are represented as observers. Appointments are expected to be made soon.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	477	In response to the Moroccan occupation of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara in 1975 and the ensuing conflict, much of the indigenous population of the region fled into Algeria. This resulted in the creation of the Saharawi refugee camp in the Tindouf region of south-western Algeria, which now represents one of the world's most protracted refugee situations. There is no formal registration of refugees in the camp, but they are believed to number more than 150,000, of whom 80 per cent are believed to be women and children.Ireland provides core funding to United Nations agencies which work on our behalf in areas such as Tindouf. For example, the World Food Programme, a key partner for Ireland, provides a general food package to the most vulnerable refugees in the Saharawi camp.  Since 1986 the value of this assistance has totalled more than €125 million.The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is also active in the Tindouf region, where it provides for basic needs and services in most sectors including food, transport, domestic needs, water, sanitation, health, shelter, community service and protection. Providing health and education assistance is the responsibility of UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). Its role includes vaccination coverage, establishing family centres, distributing schools kits, and supporting the printing of text books and improving teacher training.In addition, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland has contributed €73 million since 2006, has provided funding for Tindouf. In 2009 UNHCR received funding from CERF for its emergency programmes to help some 90,000 Saharawi refugees.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	478	The Government is deeply concerned at the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Niger.  The country is in the middle of a severe nutrition and food crisis following insufficient and irregular rains in 2009 that caused poor food harvests and water shortages.  In Niger, as many as 7.1 million people, representing 48 per cent of the country's population, do not have access to sufficient food.  According to the UN, at least 900,000 children are at risk of moderate malnutrition and 378,000 of severe malnutrition over the next 12 months if urgent action is not taken to prevent the consequences of a worsening food crisis caused by drought.To date in 2010, Ireland has provided €700,000 in humanitarian funding to two of our partners, Concern and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Niger.  Concern received funding of €500,000 for a food and nutrition programme targeting children under the age of five and pregnant women in Tahoua region.  Funding of €200,000 was directed to MSF for its work in providing medico — nutritional assistance for children under five with acute malnutrition and associated diseases in Zinder region.The Government will continue to closely monitor the situation in Niger, in co-operation with our partners on the ground including NGOs, the Red Cross and UN agencies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The security situation in the Darfur region of Sudan, where the UN estimates that seven years of conflict have resulted in the deaths of over 300,000 and the displacement of nearly three million, is of grave concern.  The persistence of sporadic violence in the region is not only affecting the population but is also directly targeting the humanitarian community.  The United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) has come under attack on several occasions in recent weeks and the UN has warned that the killing of peacekeepers, repeated kidnappings of humanitarian staff, as well as vehicle hijackings and banditry, are seriously impeding the overall humanitarian access.  The most recent incident took place on Monday 19 June, resulting in the deaths of three Rwandan peacekeepers and bringing to 27 the number of UNAMID members killed in Darfur since the force was deployed there in January 2008.Progress on the political front in Darfur is crucial to seeing some improvement in the security situation.  The Doha peace process is the focal point for international efforts to bring an end to the conflict in Darfur.  The negotiations are being led by the joint AU-UN chief mediator, Djibril Bassole, whose work Ireland fully supports.  Unfortunately, after some welcome progress earlier in the year, the Doha process suffered a serious setback in May when the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), one of Darfur's biggest rebel groups, withdrew from the negotiations.The AU-UN chief mediator, Bassole, has sought in recent weeks to persuade the main parties back to the negotiating table.  JEM has publicly announced a number of requirements before any return to the talks.  While the Government of Sudan continues its negotiations with the Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) umbrella group of rebels, it is doubtful that this group has enough numbers of combatants in south Darfur to result in substantial security gains on the ground.  Meanwhile, the Sudanese Liberation Army/ Abdul Wahid faction (SLA/AW) continues to refuse to participate in the Doha peace process or any other consultative process.  The Government of Sudan now seems to be applying a two-pronged approach by trying to weaken militarily JEM and SLA/AW, while negotiating politically with LJM.The security situation in Darfur is further exacerbated by the fact that those responsible for the violence appear free to operate in the area with impunity.  This problem has been raised frequently by the UN Secretary General in his reports on Darfur.  It has also been highlighted in the report last year of the AU High Level Panel led by former South African President Thabo Mbeki and by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Louis Moreno Ocampo, most recently in his statement last month to the UN Security Council.  In this regard, Ireland urges the Government of Sudan to fulfil its international obligations and cooperate in full with the International Criminal Court.Ireland, with its EU partners, will continue to support the ongoing efforts of the AU-UN chief mediator to achieve progress in the Doha talks.  We also welcome the commitment of other regional and international stakeholders to securing peace in Darfur.  At the same time, we believe that it is essential that a unified and coherent international approach is taken.  This approach will continue to inform EU policy on Darfur.  Ireland will also continue through its humanitarian aid programme in the region, which totalled almost €3.5 million since 2008, to provide assistance to the large numbers of people displaced by the conflict.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	480	A recent report by Concord, the European umbrella organisation for development Non-Governmental Organisations, focuses on the use of tax planning and trade pricing mechanisms by multinational mining corporations to avoid tax payments in African countries.  It calls for the implementation of a series of measures to counteract such practices, including "country by country" reporting in European and international accounting regulation and the imposition of sanctions for uncooperative tax havens.  The report also focuses on the need to build the capacity of tax collection administrations in developing countries.The Government believes strongly that the building of developing countries' capacity to mobilise domestic revenues is vital to development.  This is particularly the case in countries which are rich in natural resources.  Several of the priority countries for Ireland's development programme rely on the utilisation of natural resources to augment their domestic revenues: for example gold, precious stones and minerals in Tanzania, oil in Uganda and copper in Zambia.The Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiative, which has been developed under the EU-Africa Governance Partnership, has been instrumental in supporting improved governance and accountability through the verification and full publication of company payments and government revenues from oil, gas and mining.  Ireland strongly supports the further development of this important initiative.We also support the work now taking placing within the OECD to examine the question of a mandatory county-by-country reporting requirement for the extractive industry sector.In recent months, Ireland has contributed to the formulation of Council Conclusions on Tax and Development which were adopted by the June 2010 Foreign Affairs Council.  They set out an action plan for the further development by the EU of a comprehensive approach to support for tax administration and reforms.  They promote improved donor coordination in the tax area, and a concerted EU effort to contribute to the wider OECD agenda on tax transparency, including on transfer pricing, exchange of information, and country-by-country reporting.The EU also seeks to promote good governance in taxation as an essential element in development cooperation.  Ireland is actively supporting these efforts to develop a more transparent, cooperative and fair international tax environment, which we regard as essential to enable developing countries to finance their development, fight poverty and reduce their dependency on aid.

In the context of the clear view taken by this House on these matters, it would be for this House to decide what further steps, if any, it may wish to take in pursuance of the motion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 399 together.The issue of enlargement features regularly on the agenda of the General Affairs Council which I attend and in my bilateral discussions with EU Ministerial colleagues.  The December 2009 Council adopted detailed conclusions, subsequently endorsed by the European Council, regarding enlargement generally and in relation to the position of various aspirant member states.  It underlined that enlargement is based on consolidating commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality and the EU's capacity to integrate new members, and that each country is assessed on its own merits.On Turkey, the December Council welcomed progress in some areas of reform including judicial reform and civil-military relations.  It identified areas where further efforts are required and invited Turkey to step up the pace of reform.  Recalling previous conclusions the Council noted with deep regret Turkey's non-compliance with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol and that it had not made progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus.  It called for further progress without delay.  I may add that I had interesting and productive exchanges with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu on the negotiations when he was in Dublin on 10 March 2010.The December Council also reaffirmed its full support for the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries, which it considered remains essential for the stability, reconciliation and future of the region.  It set out detailed conclusions in respect of each of the countries in the region.The Council commended Croatia for the considerable efforts it had made in 2009 and the good overall progress achieved in meeting benchmarks in the accession process.  It noted that negotiations were entering their final phase and underlined that further efforts would be required in respect of a number of areas of reform and in relation to cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  A working group commenced work on the drafting of the Croatian Accession Treaty in December 2009.Foreign Ministers had a further discussion on the Western Balkans at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June and heard the views of prosecutor Brammertz of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on current cooperation of Serbia and Croatia.  The June Council reaffirmed the EU's unequivocal commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries and reiterated that each country's progress towards the European Union depended on its individual efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.  It welcomed the commitment of the Western Balkans to intensify the pace of reform in key areas and stressed the importance of addressing the challenges ahead.On 17 June, the European Council decided that accession negotiations should be opened with Iceland and it invited the Council to adopt a general Negotiating Framework.It is important to note that enlargement is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predetermined.  The next key milestone will be the publication by the Commission in October of annual progress reports on candidates and applicant member states.  This in turn will provide a basis for further discussion and conclusions at the December Council.As a beneficiary of past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is generally supportive of enlargement.  The prospect of enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe.  Ireland takes an active role in discussions on the issue, both at Council meetings and in bilateral discussions with existing and aspirant member states.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 71, 391 and 392 together.The issue of Iran and the major international concerns regarding its nuclear programme was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 14 June, which I attended. Discussion focussed on appropriate follow-up by the EU to the new UN Security Council Resolution 1929 which had been adopted on 9 June and which imposes further sanctions against Iran in light of its continuing non-compliance with previous UN Security Council and IAEA Resolutions. Conclusions were agreed welcoming the adoption of Resolution 1929 and reiterating the Council's support for a negotiated solution and for the continuing efforts of High Representative Ashton to engage in direct negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme as well as on other important international issues.I briefed colleagues at the Council on the discussions which I had had with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki during the course of a recent visit to Dublin. I emphasised that my message to Foreign Minister Mottaki on the nuclear issue had been very firm and clear and that I had strongly encouraged Iran to engage with High Representative Ashton on this and other matters. I also briefed on the discussions which I had had with Foreign Minister Mottaki on human rights issues and the Middle East Peace Process.The Foreign Affairs Council of 14 June also considered and agreed a draft Declaration on Iran which was subsequently adopted at the European Council meeting in Brussels on 17 June. The Declaration underlined the EU's deepening concerns about Iran's nuclear programme and, in welcoming the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1929, invites the Foreign Affairs Council to adopt accompanying EU restrictive measures which would focus on the areas of trade, the financial sector, the transport sector, key sectors of the gas and oil industry and new visa bans and asset freezes, especially in relation to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.The European Council Declaration made clear that these additional EU restrictive measures were  necessary because Iran had consistently failed to avail of the many opportunities which had been offered to it to remove the concerns of the international community over the nature of its nuclear programme. Indeed, the decision by Iran to enrich uranium to the level of 20 per cent, contrary to its international obligations under existing UN Security Council and IAEA Resolutions, had further increased these concerns. In this regard, I particularly note the last report of the IAEA of 31 May and the concerns which it clearly identified.The European Council Declaration also welcomed the recent efforts by Brazil and Turkey to secure progress on the Tehran Research Reactor agreement proposed to Iran by the IAEA in October 2009. As I made clear at my meeting with Foreign Minister Mottaki on 9 June, the tripartite agreement reached between Iran, Brazil and Turkey in Tehran on 17 May, while welcome, essentially constituted a confidence-building measure rather than addressing the core issues arising in relation to Iran's nuclear activities. The involvement of Turkey and Brazil in negotiating this agreement with Iran was no doubt a contributory factor to the decision of both countries to vote subsequently against Resolution 1929 which was otherwise adopted with twelve votes in favour and one abstention by Lebanon. Foreign Minister Amorim of Brazil has indicated that he does not envisage any future role for his country in relation to negotiations on the Tehran Research Reactor.As the European Council Declaration made clear, Ireland and our EU partners remain fully committed to working for a diplomatic solution of the issue of Iran's nuclear programme. The door to diplomatic engagement remains open and it is very much in Iran's own interests to walk through it and to take up the offer of serious negotiations with High Representative Ashton. Ireland will also continue working with our EU partners to ensure that any accompanying EU measures agreed and adopted in the coming weeks will focus on those within the regime who are driving forward the nuclear programme and will seek to avoid penalising the Iranian people at large.

Most will have worked extensively overseas in humanitarian and/or development settings.Individual members of the Corps are deployed at the request of the UN and other humanitarian organisations in need of their specific skills. Those agencies and organisations have the requisite knowledge and experience to determine where gaps exist and how best to use the skills of the Corp members.Since 2007, there have been 82 deployments of the Corps to more than 20 countries.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation. I would urge anybody who might be tempted in the current economic climate to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of the plight in which they now find themselves.Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States continues to be an important priority for this Government. We are also committed to enhancing our bilateral migration arrangements with the US through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme, known as the E3 visa, and the further development of the recently agreed working holiday programme.Over the last 12 months my Department and the Embassy in Washington in particular, has worked proactively with the US Administration and Congressional leaders to achieve positive progress on this important issue. The status of the undocumented can only be changed by virtue of legislation passed by both Houses of Congress in the US — it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments.During our St Patrick's Day visit to Washington, the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to discuss immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish in our meetings with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and leading members of Congress. As part of his St Patrick's Day address, President Obama offered an assurance that his own commitment to comprehensive immigration reform remains unwavering.President Obama has since reiterated this commitment to reform, most recently in his comprehensive speech on the issue delivered in Washington on 1 July, in which he signalled his willingness to move forward and shape a "practical, common-sense approach". Previously, President Obama welcomed what he described as the "strong proposal" for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez.The Democratic Senators' outline legislative proposal draws on the draft framework for action on immigration published in March by Senator Lindsay Graham and Senator Charles Schumer. This bipartisan proposal included provision for a path towards legalisation for the undocumented, including the Irish, provided they first admit to having violated US laws, undertake the repayment of taxes and perform community service.  This outline legislation also specifically mentions an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens. Although the proposal is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an Irish E3 scheme at this initial stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.While I am encouraged by these developments, very considerable political challenges remain, particularly in an election year.The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead. Through the Emigrant Support Programme, we have provided $285,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, since 2006, to assist with their lobbying efforts. In 2009, we also provided $10,000 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform.

In this regard the Department is constantly urging that passports should always be kept in a secure place and that citizens take particular care of the document when travelling.  However, passports are lost and the Department strongly advises that citizens notify the Passport Service of any lost passport at the earliest opportunity.Once a passport is reported lost, this information is relayed to Interpol through An Garda Síochána.  Interpol receives these updates on a daily basis.  The information is then made available immediately to police forces and border control officers worldwide.  Any individual who attempts to travel on a lost or stolen passport will as a result most likely be stopped at border control points.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 403 and 404 together.For 2010, the Government has provided an overall allocation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) of €671 million. Based on current projections Ireland's expected expenditure on ODA in 2010 will amount to approximately 0.52% of GNP, and confirms that Ireland will remain one of the most generous donors internationally on a per capita basis.The 2010 allocation represents a slight decrease of about €25 million on the 2009 ODA allocation of €696 million.   Effectively, against a background of enormous budgetary pressures, the Government succeeded in stabilising the 2010 ODA budget at its 2009 level. This was a significant achievement, and firmly reflects the Government's continued determination, supported by the Irish people, to help those in the world who can least help themselves.As the Deputy is aware, ODA as a percentage of GNP is the internationally recognised comparator of a country's aid effort.  The UN has established a target for developed countries to spend 0.7% of their GNP on ODA.  The EU has committed to meeting the UN target by 2015.  Following the budget last December, the Government committed Ireland to meeting the UN target by 2015, thereby aligning us with our fellow EU Member States.  Ireland remains ahead of most Member States in progress towards the 2015 target and we will exceed the interim target set by the EU of spending at least 0.51% of GNP on ODA in 2010.As we move towards 2015, the Government will make every effort, subject to the need to stabilise our public finances, to progress to the 0.7% target.For 2010 the Government is determined that our aid programme will continue to maintain its sharp focus on poverty reduction, concentrating on a limited number of very poor, mainly African, countries. I have just returned from visits to Uganda and Ethiopia where I witnessed for myself the excellent work being carried out on the ground by my Department, through Irish Aid and by other development organisations such as NGOs and missionaries. We are making a real and tangible difference in the lives of many and there is great hope for the future.In the current difficult economic environment, we will work to ensure that we continue to deliver the programme so that it has maximum impact and is rigorously focused on achieving clear results for the lives of the poor and the hungry.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	489	On 20 June 2010, the second round of Presidential elections took place in Colombia.  Juan Manuel Santos of the Social National Unity Party (Partido Social de Unidad National), was declared the winner with 69% of the vote while the Green Party candidate, Antanas Mockus, attained 27.5% of the vote.  President-elect Santos will take office on 7 August.  The Organization of American States electoral observation mission noted that the elections took place in a transparent manner and were conducted correctly.I note that President-elect Santos has called for a Government of National Unity with a view to consolidating democracy in Colombia.  Ireland will fully support all efforts by the incoming Government to advance social and economic development for the people of Colombia.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	490	As I indicated to the Deputy on 02 June last I have asked my officials to examine the feasibility of providing passport production equipment in other parts of the country.  However, I do not expect that a decision in this regard will be made in the short term.  The priority for the Passport Service at present is to reduce the substantial backlog in passport applications and to restore the normal turnaround time for passport processing at the earliest opportunity.  At that time the question of additional passport office services will be examined in more detail.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I am aware of China's announcement that it is planning to sell two nuclear reactors to Pakistan. This has raised concerns in the international community both in relation to undertakings by China regarding the transfer of nuclear goods, as well as potential proliferation risks associated with Pakistan. At the recent plenary meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, Ireland was among those who expressed concern and sought further information on the issue. A representative of China at the meeting explained that in recent years China has had a level of cooperation with Pakistan in civil/nuclear energy in line with the two countries' legal obligations. He assured the plenary that such cooperation was exclusively for peaceful purposes and that the facilities were subject to IAEA safeguards.Pakistan has long been the focus of international unease related to nuclear proliferation. There are serious concerns that rogue states or terrorist organizations could obtain nuclear material or expertise from Pakistan. This concern has been heightened due to the ongoing conflict in neighbouring Afghanistan, and the porous nature of their common border. These worries have not been helped by the knowledge that a former top Pakistani nuclear official — A.Q. Khan — for many years used a clandestine network to supply Libya, North Korea, and Iran with materials related to uranium enrichment.The proposed China-Pakistan deal underlines again the pressing need for Pakistan to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon State. Pakistan is one of only three States not party to the Treaty. India — another key regional player — and Israel are the other two. In May this year I addressed the Review Conference of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty in New York and called on these three States to join the Treaty. We will continue to press for the Treaty's universality, and for these three States to place all their nuclear facilities under IAEA Full-Scope Safeguards. Only in this way can the international community have the necessary confidence that potentially deadly materials cannot be diverted for terrorist or other destructive purposes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The Deputy has highlighted an issue that is both current and sensitive, and it is true that food shortages give rise to discussion about the potential of genetically modified crops to feed the growing world population.We have a very clear position on this issue in relation to our aid programme. Ireland's support to the agricultural strategies of partner countries is provided within the context of the national policies of each country and in accordance with Ireland's policy of promoting local ownership of the development process. The use of genetically modified (GM) food and crops to feed the growing population in the developing world is a matter for the government of each developing country and we respect their decision in this regard.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 380 together.The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by Heads of Government at the Millennium Summit in 2000 provide the framework for international development up to 2015.  Progress on the MDGs will be reviewed at a UN Summit in New York in September.  The Government has been actively engaged at the UN and with our EU partners to ensure that, working together, developed and developing countries can maintain their commitments to the world's poorest people in the face of increased global challenges and continuing international economic difficulty.  Ireland is playing an important role in the preparations for the Review Summit.The Report on the MDGs for 2010, which was launched recently by the UN Secretary General, notes that much progress has been made and that, through nationally-owned development policies and plans supported by international partners, the MDGs can still be achieved by 2015.  However, progress remains too slow and in some cases progress has been eroded by the global financial, economic and food crises since 2007.The Government has taken a lead internationally to focus attention at the Summit on the continuing scandal of global hunger.  We have made the point strongly at meetings in Europe, Africa and the United States that slow progress on the first of the MDGs, the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, is not only a scandal in itself, but is impeding progress across the whole range of development goals.  We are also arguing that priority be given to those regions and groups that are making the slowest progress, in particular those most vulnerable to extreme poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, which is the primary geographic focus of the Government's aid programme.Ireland played a major role in the preparation of a strong EU position for the Summit.  Two weeks ago the Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions focusing on increasing the direct engagement of developing countries in achieving the MDGs, improving the effectiveness of development efforts and mobilising resources for development.Nationally, we are also preparing with the US Administration for the organisation of a joint High Level Forum which I will chair with Secretary of State Clinton during the Summit to promote a comprehensive international approach to the global hunger crisis.  This will highlight the need to link agriculture, food security and nutrition programming in order to provide a realistic and sustainable solution to world hunger.  We are also consulting closely with Irish and other development NGOs in advance of the Summit.The Government is determined that Ireland will play an important role at the New York Summit, in line with the effectiveness and international reputation of our development programme.  I will ensure that the composition of the delegation from my Department will reflect this foreign policy priority.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I am extremely concerned about the situation of those in same-sex relationships in certain African countries.  In many countries in Africa, though not all, same-sex relationships are illegal.  Even where they are not illegal, they are often not well tolerated, with people suffering violence and discrimination as a result of their sexual orientation.  At the same time, many such countries have signed up to international conventions and made commitments in relation to human rights which they must be urged to respect in full.Most recently, there have been high profile situations of concern in Uganda and Malawi, which we have been monitoring since they arose.  In Uganda a new Private Member's Bill entitled "Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009" was submitted by MP David Bahati late last year which aimed to broaden the criminalisation of homosexuality by introducing the death penalty for certain categories of conviction.  The Bill subsequently was sent to a committee for review, although it has not yet been withdrawn.   In Malawi, two men, Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, who held a traditional engagement ceremony were charged with "unnatural practices between males and gross public indecency" and subsequently convicted for "unnatural acts" and gross indecency and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour.  Although President Mutharika subsequently granted them an unconditional pardon, the decision was taken on humanitarian grounds and the law which was used to convict them has not changed.Our ongoing dialogues with Governments in Africa include human rights issues.  Uganda and Malawi are priority countries for our Irish Aid programme and as such we have better access to the Governments of those countries.  Since the Bill was first proposed, our Embassy in Kampala expressed our deep concerns to the Government of Uganda.  When I was in Kampala last week, I availed of the opportunity in meeting with Foreign Minister Kutesa, to raise this issue again and to renew our serious concerns.  The Foreign Minister assured me that his Government is dealing with the matter; he reiterated that this was a Private Member's Bill which was not sponsored by the Government.  I also discussed the matter with the Chair of the Uganda Human Rights Commission, which has been asked by Parliament to give its views on the Bill and which underlined to me its view that Uganda should respect its obligations under international covenants.  The Irish Embassy in Kampala will continue to monitor the situation closely and will remain in contact with local human rights and representative groups on this issue.Similarly, our Embassy in Lilongwe expressed our serious concerns to the Government of Malawi as soon as charges were brought in the case there.  My colleague, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Peter Power, TD, made a public statement condemning the conviction.  In addition, we supported a similar statement made by Catherine Ashton, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  The Irish Embassy in Lilongwe will continue to coordinate with partners to seek appropriate changes to the relevant laws in Malawi.Another forum for discussion is the Universal Periodic Review mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council, which provides opportunities to raise human rights situations of concern and allows each State under review to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to fulfil their human rights obligations.  Ireland has been an active participant in this process, raising matters of interest and making recommendations, including on issues of sexual orientation in the case of a number of reviews.  The 9th session of Universal Periodic Reviews at the Human Rights Council will take place in November, when the human rights situation in Malawi will be reviewed.  Uganda's review will take place at the 12th Session in late 2011.Both Malawi and Uganda are states parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  The Human Rights Committee, which monitors the implementation of the ICCPR, has affirmed that the principle of non-discrimination includes the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.  This principle underpins the ICCPR, as it underpins the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Along with EU and international partners we shall continue to impress upon both Governments the need for them to comply with their own obligations under international human rights agreements and to protect all their citizens.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I welcome the decision taken by the UN Secretary General on 22 June to appoint a Panel of Experts to advise on the issue of accountability with regard to alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended in May last year.The Panel will be made up of three distinguished legal officials, Mr Marzuki Darusman (Indonesia), who will serve as Chairperson, Ms Yasmin Sooka (South Africa) and Mr Stephen Ratner (USA).  It is expected to complete its work within four months.  In particular, it will look into "modalities, applicable international standards and comparative experience with regard to accountability processes, taking into account the nature and scope of any alleged violations in Sri Lanka".As reported to Deputies previously, I have long called for the establishment of an independent inquiry to investigate responsibility for alleged violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law committed by both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the course of the conflict in Sri Lanka, particularly during its final months.  I believe that accountability is an integral part of the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka.The European Union has taken the same view.  In Council Conclusions issued on 27 October 2009, EU Foreign Ministers repeated their view that possible violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law by all actors in Sri Lanka should be subject to an "independent and credible inquiry".Regrettably, intensive efforts by the EU last year to secure the agreement of the UN Human Rights Council for the establishment of such an inquiry were unsuccessful.  Nevertheless, in spite of this, I am still firmly of the view that an inquiry of this kind is essential, though I am not optimistic that one will be authorized in the near future.The Panel which has now been set up by the Secretary-General is particularly welcome in these circumstances and I believe its work will form an important element in the overall response of the international community to Sri Lanka's post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs.   In this context, it is deeply disappointing that the Government of Sri Lanka has reacted in such a negative way to the appointment of the Panel, describing it as an unwarranted and unnecessary interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation.A genuine process of dialogue and reconciliation must be initiated in Sri Lanka with a view to securing sustainable peace for all the people of the island.  Such a process should involve the UN and others in the international community.  Without reconciliation there can be no return to long-term security or prosperity for Sri Lanka.  Ireland will continue with its efforts, both bilaterally and with our partners in the EU, to support the peace process in Sri Lanka.Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 47.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The eradication of global hunger is a key component of Ireland's foreign policy and a cornerstone of our development programme.  We recognise that strengthening international coordination and enhancing global governance for agriculture, food and nutrition security through a global partnership among development partners, which builds on existing institutions and fosters effective partnerships among key stakeholders, is fundamental to addressing world hunger.  We also recognise the central role that the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and its Committee on Food Security play in the shared objective of increasing agricultural productivity and providing food and nutrition security for the world's rapidly growing population.A reform process is underway at FAO in order to enhance its authority and capacity to effectively and rapidly respond to the challenge of world hunger.  While the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has primary responsibility for Ireland's engagement with the FAO and its reform process, I expect that the Committee on Food Security will become the main global forum for discussion on global food and nutrition security issues.  Its revitalised role will ensure greater policy convergence including through the development of international strategies and voluntary guidelines on food security and nutrition based on best practices and lessons learned from countries which have managed to make progress in reducing hunger.The new Committee is also now the most inclusive food security forum, ensuring that all relevant voices are heard in the policy debate on food and agriculture.  Its participation has been expanded to include a wide range of organisations working in the food security and nutrition areas from UN agencies and international financial institutions, to civil society and non-governmental organisations, and international agricultural research institutions.As noted by the Deputy, the World Bank also has a key role to play in the area of agriculture, food security and nutrition.  Ireland, acting through the Department of Finance which has lead responsibility, and my own Department, supports the World Bank's activities and operations aimed at increasing agricultural productivity in developing countries and improving nutrition outcomes in the households of the world's most poor and vulnerable people.Ireland supports the World Bank's International Development Association, one of its development institutions which aims to reduce poverty and improve living standards with a focus on the world's poorest and most food insecure nations.  We also support the Bank's International Finance Corporation and its private sector development work, which includes assisting developing countries to enhance the role of agribusiness and improve access to markets for farmers.We support the World Bank's Global Food Crisis Response Programme established in 2008 to provide rapid financing to poor countries hard hit by rising food prices.  We support the Bank's continued investment in agricultural development through its various programmes in developing countries, which is estimated at some $8 billion this year.  These programmes focus on increasing agricultural productivity, and improving farmers' access to markets.  We supported the establishment last year of a new Agriculture Finance Support Facility to increase farmers' access to financial services, such as credit and insurance.Just last week, Ireland contributed €500,000 to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme, a new trust fund managed by the World Bank to scale up support to help poor countries improve food security through increased agricultural production.Our support to the World Bank's agricultural interventions, and for a more effective and coherent Food and Agricultural Organisation and Committee on Food Security, are fully in line with the recommendations of the Government's 2008 Hunger Task Force.We are committed to giving effect to the recommendations of Hunger Task Force and continue to work on the three priority areas identified in its Report, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition, especially maternal and infant; and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger.  We are making good progress in implementing the recommendations of the Report across the Irish Aid programme, the overseas development assistance programme channelled and delivered through my Department.The Government will continue to ensure that Ireland plays its role in all efforts to eradicate the scourge of global hunger and to meet our clear international target, the hunger target of the first Millennium Development Goal, to halve the number of hungry by 2015.  Ireland’s Special Envoy on Hunger, Kevin Farrell, will report on the progress that we and our partners are making towards the end of this year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 401 together.The entire world was deeply moved by the plight of the Haitian people following the earthquake on 14 January.  The devastation wrought and the impact on peoples' lives were made all the worse by the levels of poverty experienced by most Haitians.The Government responded quickly to the events in Haiti by undertaking Irish Aid's largest-ever humanitarian airlift.  More than 130 tonnes of emergency shelter, water and sanitation equipment were transported to Haiti on two DC10s and a Hercules C130 aircraft and were distributed by Irish NGOs Concern, Goal and Trócaire.  More than 12,000 Haitian families received vital assistance in the aftermath of the earthquake as a result of this operation.  The Government also provided emergency funding to UN and other humanitarian agencies working to save lives in Haiti.  Lives were saved by our rapid response to this enormous natural disaster.My colleague the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Deputy Peter Power, is visiting Haiti this week to assess the impact of Ireland's contribution to the relief effort and to discuss the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti with representatives of the United Nations.  While in Port au Prince he will visit a number of Irish Aid-funded projects being implemented by development agencies, as well as meeting members of Irish Aid's Rapid Response Corps.At an International Conference on the reconstruction of Haiti held on 31 March the Government pledged €13 million over three years towards relief, recovery and development in Haiti.  This includes €1 million towards the cancellation of Haiti's remaining debt to the World Bank.  The Irish statement to this conference highlighted the generosity of the Irish public in contributing millions of Euro to emergency appeals, as well as the role played by Irish NGOs and others in addressing the humanitarian crisis.  The International Conference mobilised more than US$9 billion in donor support for Haiti's recovery and reconstruction, including €1.2 billion from the EU.  The international community, in partnership with the Haitian government, has established an Interim Commission to oversee the reconstruction effort and a Trust Fund, which will be managed by the World Bank.To date direct emergency funding provided by Ireland in response to the earthquake amounts to more than €3.2 million and covers a range of sectors, including sanitation, child protection, education, cash for work and agricultural recovery.  Funding has been provided through three groups of partners: UN humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs such as Christian Aid, Concern, Goal, Haven, Plan Ireland and World Vision.Because of the direct impact of the earthquake on personnel and infrastructure, the Haitian Government will require technical and other support from international experts in order to fully discharge its responsibilities.  In response to this, Irish Aid has allocated €200,000 to the UN Human Settlements Programme, UN-HABITAT, for the provision of technical and secretariat support services to the Haitian Government, to assist them and build their capacity in areas such as housing, social and physical infrastructure, and urban and spatial planning.  UN-HABITAT carried out an extensive analysis of the urban spatial and planning requirements of Port au Prince prior to the earthquake and had already identified areas where improvements needed to be made to ensure a safer city.The Government's contribution of in kind assistance via our humanitarian airlift exceeds €1.4 million.  This also includes the deployment to date of eleven members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps.  These highly skilled volunteers have been supporting the emergency operations of organisations such as the World Food Programme, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Concern and Goal.In addition to our direct support to Haiti, Ireland is a strong supporter of the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund which has provided funding to Haiti as part of its remit to respond to humanitarian crises around the globe.  Ireland has contributed €73 million to the CERF since it was established in 2006.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	498	Trade relations with Israel are determined at EU level.I have been very active in criticising and drawing attention to those aspects of Israeli policy with which we disagree, particularly in relation to the continuing occupation of Palestinian Territories.  I will continue to do so, both directly and at EU and UN level, and also to encourage both Israelis and Palestinians who are prepared to work and engage together to achieve a settlement.However, as I have made clear on many occasions, including at the ICTU Conference on Palestine in April 2010, the Government does not support proposals for trade, academic, cultural or other boycotts against Israel.  This has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments.Such an approach would not increase our influence on Israeli policy or public opinion, nor among our EU colleagues.  Nor is there any possibility of reaching agreement on such a policy at EU level.As the Deputy will be aware, I set out my views on this matter in more detail in a recent meeting with the Joint Committee on European Affairs, on 22 June 2010.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Rockall is a small uninhabitable rock, 25 by 30 metres wide, located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.  It marks a point at which the Rockall Bank, part of the very large Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf extending under the north-east Atlantic Ocean, protrudes 21 metres above sea level.  During the 1960s and 1970s the issue of Rockall was a source of legal and political controversy in both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom claims sovereignty over Rockall and his sought to formally annex it under its Island of Rockall Act 1972.As I said in response to the most recent question on this issue on 19 May last, while Ireland has not recognised British sovereignty over Rockall it has never sought to claim sovereignty for itself.  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, Ireland worked hard to achieve agreement on this principle.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that:  "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf."  Rockall falls into precisely this category.In 1988, Ireland and the UK reached agreement on the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries, stretching out up to 500 nautical miles from their respective coastlines.  This included the division of the Hatton-Rockall area of continental shelf on which Rockall is situated, although under the terms of the Law of the Sea Convention the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary.  According to that determination, Rockall is situated to the north of the boundary agreed with the UK in 1988 and lies outside the zone claimed by Ireland.As with any claim to continental shelf lying beyond 200 nautical miles from shore, the UN Convention requires that Ireland and the UK submit their claims for examination by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  However, the claims to the Hatton-Rockall shelf agreed between Ireland and the UK are not accepted by Iceland or the Faeroe Islands, which make their own claims.  The four sides have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  In view of the 10-year deadline for the making of submissions to the UN Commission — which for Ireland expired in May last year — Ireland lodged its national claim for this area in March 2009.  While the Commission's rules of procedure prevent consideration of the submission without the consent of all the states concerned, its submission at this time stops the clock on the deadline and preserves Ireland's legal position.  In the meantime, the four sides intend to keep the matter under regular review and we will continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of the submission by the Commission as soon as possible.The State's continental shelf has already been successfully extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the area to the west of the Porcupine Bank.  Together with France, Spain and the UK, we have also made a successful submission to the UN Commission in relation to a large area of seabed in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay and the four countries will shortly begin discussions on its division between them.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 93 together.Angola has undergone major development since the end of its civil war, one of the longest-running civil wars in Africa, in 2002.  It has achieved rapid economic growth, thanks to a boom in oil production and high international oil prices.  However, this wealth has not translated to the general population but has remained in the hands of a restricted number with a huge disparity between wealth and poverty.  In addition, hopes that the ending of the civil war would lead to more political openness have only partially been fulfilled.Angola last held parliamentary and presidential elections in September 2008.  While an EU Election Observation Mission welcomed the peaceful conduct of the elections it did not go as far as describing them as free and fair and made several recommendations in its final report, including strengthening the impartiality the National Elections Commission (CNE).  Although the Government of Angola took note of the recommendations of the report, no major changes have been implemented to date.  The next Parliamentary elections are due to be held in 2012.  In relation to possible international assistance for the elections, the EU-Angola Country Strategy Paper for the period 2008-2013 allows for support to the Angolan electoral cycle as defined.  The areas of voter education and capacity-building to key institutions, including the National Electoral Commission have been identified as possibilities for assistance.  However, EU assistance, including a possible electoral observation mission, is of course dependent on a request being made by the national authorities.The situation in Angola has not been the subject of recent discussions at Ministerial level in the EU.  It is, however discussed at working group level of the EU and EU missions in Luanda work with the Government of Angola on an ongoing basis including political dialogue within the framework of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.Corruption in Angola is a serious problem, with the country regularly amongst Transparency International's top 20 most corrupt countries.  There have been some efforts in recent months by the Government to improve governance and introduce more accountability into the system.  Measures include legislation to introduce greater transparency to the national budget which was passed by the National Assembly in March.Conscious that the country's rapid economic growth masks huge inequalities, Irish Aid provides some funding to the Angolan people, amounting to almost €7.6 million since 2006.  This funding is channelled through Irish and international NGOs including Trócaire, Concern and Christian Aid and through Irish missionaries .  These funds have been employed in programmes promoting good governance, also programmes combating HIV & AIDS, reducing food insecurity and various humanitarian assistance projects.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I spent last week visiting Uganda and Ethiopia, two of the nine priority countries for the Government's aid programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.I visited Ethiopia from 30 June to 2 July.  My main objective was to assess the impact of our development programme on the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Ethiopia, and its contribution to the remarkable development and economic growth which the country has experienced in recent years.  I held political discussions with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Acting Foreign Minister, Dr.  Tekeda Alemu, and I reviewed regional issues, including the situation in Sudan, with the Chairman of the African Union Commission Jean Ping, at the Headquarters of the organisation in Addis Ababa.Ireland has been providing development assistance to Ethiopia since 1990.  Ethiopia has been a priority country for long term development assistance from Irish Aid since 1994.  Building on the remarkable work of Irish missionaries over many decades, the Irish aid programme has focused clearly on hunger and food security and the provision of basic services to the Ethiopian people.  I witnessed the impact of this cooperation when I visited health facilities and schools outside Addis Ababa with the Minister of Health, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  I also visited projects being undertaken by Irish NGOs and missionaries with street children and with people living with HIV and AIDS.  I met with a wide range of Irish NGOs and volunteers working in Ethiopia with a commitment to partnership with local communities to tackle poverty, hunger and disease and building a brighter future for the country and its people.Ethiopia has made enormous progress in recent years.  The proportion of people living on less than $1 a day has fallen from 60% in 1990 to 36% in 2007.  Over the past twenty years, primary school enrolment has quadrupled, and child mortality has been reduced by almost fifty percent.  The country continues to face significant development challenges, not least as a result of continuing population growth and the effects of climate change.  However, I was deeply impressed by the commitment of the Government and the Ethiopian people to the development of their economy and their country.  I visited the new Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which has been developed with support from Irish Aid, and saw the impact it is having on the lives of producers of basic commodities including coffee, and the influence it is beginning to bring to bear on the lives of rural communities and on Ethiopia's economic role in Africa.  I also met with a number of Irish business people who are investing in Ethiopia, helping to create opportunities for employment, trade and new links with Ireland and Europe.I am convinced that by continuing to focus on a development partnership with Ethiopia aimed at reducing poverty and fighting hunger and at the same time building closer business and trade links between our two countries, Ireland can continue to make a very significant contribution to sustainable development in the country and the wider region.Ireland's role in Ethiopia over many decades was recognised in all my discussions during my visit.  Against this background, I had the opportunity for very open discussions with the Prime Minister and other political leaders on political developments in Ethiopia and on the conduct and aftermath of the recent elections, the human rights situation and the very positive role Ethiopia is playing internationally on global issues, including climate change.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	503	China has rapidly increased its engagement with nearly every African state in recent years.  Trade between Africa and China has grown an average of 30% per annum in the past decade and now stands at over US$100 billion, making China the continent's second largest trading partner after the US.  China shares with other major economic powers a desire to gain access to natural resources, but also important is the desire to tap Africa's huge market of one billion people.  This is testament to the enormous economic potential of Africa, which is now the third fastest growing region in the world, after China and India.  It is also indicative of a growing trend of economic ties being formed between African and other developing and emerging market countries.  This South-South trade cooperation is proving to be a critical new catalyst for Africa's economic growth.I am aware of the contrast often made between what has been perceived as the commercial focus of China's policy in Africa and the primary focus of Ireland and the EU on issues such as poverty reduction, human rights and good governance.  However, I believe that this contrast can be overstated.  There are signs that China is increasingly aware of the importance of peace and stability in Africa and, as such, these are areas of shared interest with Ireland and the EU.  China also has a large contribution to make in Africa by the sharing of experience on the reduction of poverty, including in some key areas for Africa such as raising agricultural productivity.  At the most recent EU-China Summit, held in Nanjing last November, both sides welcomed trilateral dialogue between the EU, China and Africa, and agreed to explore appropriate areas for cooperation.  They reaffirmed their commitment to supporting the full and timely achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and to supporting Africa's sustainable development and early economic recovery from the global financial crisis.  I am also of the view that the commitment of African countries to human rights, gender equality, good governance and the fight against corruption is not only the product of pressure related to assistance from donors.  African countries are participants in a wide range of international instruments which guarantee such freedoms and are, as is Ireland, accountable under the terms of these international agreements.Ireland, for our part, has had a long and fruitful relationship with Africa.   With the increasing globalisation of Africa, opportunities also lie there for Ireland to develop our relationship with the continent in new areas that will benefit us both.  Ireland's total merchandise trade with Africa in 2009 was approximately €1.4 billion.  However, I firmly believe that there is potential to grow and expand our trading relationship with the continent of Africa.  The improvements in infrastructure, energy, and the availability of skilled workforces achieved in many partner countries with support from Irish Aid, means that doing business in Africa can be a real possibility for the right companies in the right sectors.  My Department welcomes the opportunity to provide support to Irish companies wishing to expand their business into Africa.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I refer the Deputy to my reply of 22 June last to Parliamentary Question number 26769/10 regarding the extensive consultation process undertaken by my Department as part of the development of Ireland's National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325.The guide referred to by the Deputy is a welcome addition to the extensive literature already in existence on how to shape a National Action Plan.  The eight steps mentioned in this recent publication have informed the work of developing the draft National Action Plan and are an important input to the process.  They reflect ideas which have been conveyed by civil society members of the consultative group on 1325, which was established to advise on the drafting of the Plan.The National Women's Council of Ireland and the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence were invited to select participants to contribute to the group's work and the Department also nominated other experts to become involved in its work.A comprehensive audit of Government activity in the areas covered by UNSCR 1325 was also conducted and replies were received from the Departments of Defence and Justice, incorporating responses from the Permanent Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  My Department also conducted an audit of its own activities and a submission was received from the civil society organisations present on the consultative group.  The structure and content of the draft National Action Plan, currently being prepared, draws on the Resolution itself and deals with the key issues of participation, protection and gender perspectives.  The draft also proposes a monitoring framework which sets out clear actions and indicators, and allocates responsibility to a specific Government body, with clear timelines for each action.The success of the National Action Plan will depend on effective monitoring and evaluation and I look forward to further discussions with civil society representatives as to how best this can be achieved.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	505	Ireland supports African countries' efforts to achieve the aims of the Maputo Declaration in a variety of ways.  We are directly engaged in the agricultural sector in a number of countries particularly Malawi and Tanzania.  Ireland's programmes of General Budget Support are also helping our partner countries meet the Maputo Declaration target.  We also support the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme, or CAADP.CAADP is an African owned regional framework for guiding investment in the agricultural sector that was endorsed by the member states of the African Union in the Maputo Declaration of 2003.  CAADP is based on the pursuit of six percent average annual growth in the agricultural sector at national level as well as the Maputo Declaration's explicit target of an allocation of ten percent of national budgets to agriculture.  Agricultural spending by African governments is now increasing.  To date at least eight countries have met the ten percent target while another sixteen countries reached expenditure shares of five to ten percent.  There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that the agricultural sectors of countries signed up to the CAADP agenda are already demonstrating improved growth.Ireland supports the CAADP process on a number of levels.  Last year we provided €1.5m through the appropriate World Bank Multi Donor Trust Fund which was established to support the development of the CAADP process.  Eighteen African countries have now signed up to the framework and aligned their agricultural policies.  This year Irish Aid has contributed €500,000 to the new Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme of the World Bank which is managing support for the national investment plans developed through CAADP.  In addition we are focusing our support at country level to ensure the quality of these investment plans, particularly in Malawi and Tanzania, two countries where we are coordinating all donors in the agriculture sector.  The €23m of Irish Aid funding channelled through the European Development Fund in 2010 is also a significant and relevant contribution to the agricultural work of our partner governments.  The European Commission is a major donor to the agricultural sector in general and also to CAADP.  In relation to the CAADP process it has provided €5m over the last three years.The Commission will continue to provide significant levels of funding to the development of the agriculture sector in Africa in various ways that are aligned with CAADP priorities.  We understand that the overall level of assistance from the Commission for CAADP and related agriculture sector development programmes is likely to remain above €400m per annum up to 2013.

My Department coordinates the national response to the Commission's requests for information in respect of this Regulation.Article 16 of the Regulation specifically mandates the Commission to work with the Member States, in the context of the work of the Committee set up under this Regulation, to develop a common classification for reporting consumer complaints and enquiries, which they will use to inform future policy decisions.  On 12 May 2010, the EU Commission issued two documents on this issue: 2010 Document C(2010) 3021 and document SEC(2010) 572.  The latter contains very detailed specifications in regard to a harmonised methodology for classifying and reporting consumer complaints and enquires across a broad range of sectors.  The Commission has requested my Department to use this methodology in reporting consumer complaints and enquiries for 2009.  My Department is currently in contact with all relevant stakeholders in this regard.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I am advised that the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is running a grant scheme called the "home energy savings scheme" which gives grants to homeowners to upgrade the thermal performance of their homes.  Two of the methods that can achieve this are insulating the external wall using external insulation and/or full fill cavity insulation.The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), operates certified installer schemes for contractors to allow them to offer services in accordance with the home energy savings scheme.  In total, the NSAI currently has 3 installer schemes: Full Fill Cavity Wall Insulation (262 registered installers); Blown Loft Insulation (10 registered installers); External Insulation (34 registered installers).  NSAI has established these schemes where the quality of installation and workmanship is critical to the performance of the system/product.  The schemes are focused on the verification of the competence of the installers and ensuring that they have a quality system in place.An additional 125 applications are awaiting an audit.  I am advised that all of these outstanding applications are for registration on the external insulation installer scheme.  Of the 125 contractors waiting to be audited 78 have been contacted to arrange a suitable date for an audit.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received statutory redundancy lump sum claims on 25 March, 2010 in respect of the individuals concerned.  These claims await processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from November 2009.In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2010 new claims amounted to 33,876 — a fall off of 20% on the corresponding 6 month period in 2009 when 42,323 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome.  Inroads are being made in the backlog of claims reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a level of 33,729 at end June 2010.  In the first six months of 2010, 40,527 claims were processed, up 115% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

In addition, services imports from that country for 2008, the last year for which data are available, were valued at €75 million.I understand that a preferential customs status applies for certain goods traded between the EU and Israel but that goods exported from illegal Israeli settlements cannot benefit from these preferential rates.  However, it is the Revenue Commissioners Customs Service that is the competent Irish Authority to implement rules of origin controls on imports of goods into Ireland and to apply the appropriate tariff duties.  My Department has no function in regard to these matters.

As I advised the Deputy in previous replies, I can confirm that my Department has received claims for the former employees of the company concerned under both Schemes.In relation to the Redundancy Payments Scheme there are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums payable to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can advise the Deputy that payment issued on 14 June 2010 in respect of six statutory redundancy lump sum claims received in my Department over the period October/November 2009 for the former employees of the company concerned.In relation to the claims under the Insolvency Payments Scheme, my Department received applications from the liquidator in respect of holiday pay for 11 former employees of this company in the period November 2009 to April 2010.  These claims have been processed by the Insolvency Payments Unit and payments issued in respect of eligible claims in May 2010.

She indicated that, in the light of these concerns, she would look at whether the level of harmonisation in the proposed Directive was sufficiently targeted towards those issues that would have most benefit from a Single Market point of view.  She added that ‘a possibility' in this context ‘could be to go for fully harmonised rules on distance contracts and allow diverging national rules for face-to-face contracts.'While Vice-President Reding has restated her willingness to take a flexible approach to future discussions on the proposed Directive, her more recent remarks have signalled something of a shift from the previous suggestion that different levels of harmonisation might apply to different types of contracts.  In an address to the 2nd Consumer Rights Forum on 2 June 2010, she stated that a distinction between distance and off-premises contracts on the one hand and on-premises contracts on the other was ‘less helpful' in the areas of remedies and guarantees for faulty goods and of unfair contract terms.  In the area of pre-contractual information requirements for consumers, she appeared to suggest that the proposed Directive might retain fully harmonised rules for distance and off-premises contracts as these were the types of transaction for which the single market case was strongest.  In the case of information requirements for on-premises contracts, however, it ‘could be appropriate to allow Member States to keep their current rules' rather than to have Community rules that would apply on a minimum harmonisation basis.The comments and suggestions from Vice-President Reding should be viewed in the context of the fluid and complex character of the discussions and perspectives on the proposed Directive.  If agreement is to be reached on the proposal, all sides will have to show flexibility and a willingness to consider new approaches while upholding a commitment to the maintenance of a high level of consumer protection.I am not aware of any specific concerns expressed by consumer groups at suggestions that a mixed harmonisation approach might be taken to the proposed Directive.  As consumer groups had previously expressed concern at the across-the-board application of full harmonisation to the proposal, it is not implausible that some may have taken encouragement from the signs of greater flexibility on the issue.

Amgen subsequently entered into contracts to purchase the entire holding from IDA and, in 2006, applied for Planning Permission for a Bulk Manufacturing facility and associated works.  Site ground works commenced in late 2006.  The terms of the agreement, between IDA and Amgen included a provision for the reversion of the beneficial interest in the site to IDA in the event of the project not proceeding and this occurred formally in January 2010.In October, 2007, Amgen announced a postponement of its Cork Project.  At that time Amgen gave an undertaking to maintain the site in a good secure manner in order to protect the asset and maintain good local community relations.  An assessment of its business needs has led Amgen to conclude that it no longer wishes to proceed with the project.  In keeping with the terms of the original agreement, ownership of the Carrigtwohill site has now reverted to IDA Ireland.  IDA Ireland will continue to market this Strategic Site and the Cork City Gateway.  Since 2007 there have been 35 IDA supported announcements with in excess of 3,000 jobs and over €728 million total investments agreed and announced for the South West.

They provide protection, typically, to the lender and not the borrower.  As against this, they would reduce the systemic risk of high loan to value loans.  Like other insurance products, they have a premium so making such insurance mandatory imposes an additional cost which is likely to ultimately fall on the borrower.  I would expect that the role of such credit risk mitigants in the mortgage market going forward will be considered by the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt in the next phase of their work.

I am happy to outline to the Deputy the current situation on the implementation of the carbon tax, at a rate of €15 per tonne, which I announced in the Budget last December.  The first phase involved the carbon tax being applied to transport fuels, petrol and auto-diesel, from Budget night onwards, ie, December 10, 2009.  The second phase came into effect from 1 May 2010 with the carbon tax applying to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as ‘green diesel' or ‘agricultural diesel'), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas.  The third and final phase involves the application of the tax to coal and commercial peat, which is subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order.Solid fuels are subject to a commencement order so as to allow time for issues such as fuel poverty and the sourcing of coal of a lower environmental standard from Northern Ireland to be addressed.  In the context of preparing for the final phase of the application of the carbon tax the views of the Solid Fuel Trade Group are being considered and indeed meetings have taken place with the relevant Government Departments in this area.

Under EU rules, contracts for supplies and services above certain thresholds must be advertised EU wide.  The thresholds are currently €125,000 for the Central Government sector and €193,000 for most other authorities. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal sanctions which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.The Government recognises the important business opportunities that public service contracts represent for business enterprises and encourages participation to the greatest extent possible. My Department has been examining issues impacting on the small and medium business sector in the current public procurement market and, in consultation with the recently established National Procurement Service within the Office of Public Works, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other stakeholders in the public procurement market, has developed guidance for contracting authorities on measures to facilitate SME participation in the public procurement market. This will be issued shortly.

As the Deputy will be aware, Member States must apply a standard rate of VAT, and may opt to also apply one or two reduced rates of VAT to certain goods and services listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive.  In addition, where a Member State applied a zero rate or reduced rate to specific goods or services on 1 January 1991, they may retain that system.  However, no other items may be charged at the zero rate, or items outside of those listed in Annex III at a reduced rate, where they had not been subject to the reduced or zero rate before 1991.  In this context, Annex III permits Member States to apply a reduced rate to certain pharmaceutical products, of between 5% and 15%, and this applies to non-oral medicines.  However, as the zero rate did not apply to non-oral medicines on 1 January 1991, they cannot legally apply at that rate.In Ireland the zero VAT rate applies to oral medicines, as it was in place prior to 1 January 1991.  The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to non-oral medicines, as it does to the majority of all goods and services in the State.  The standard rate of VAT is applied to non-oral medicines in view of the cost involved in applying a reduced rate.  The application of a reduced rate to such medicines would also lead to calls for other goods and services to be charged at a reduced rate.

Negotiations in respect of the Bank of Ireland plan are at an advanced stage, and a decision is expected from the European Commission by mid-2010. AIB has adjusted the content of its plan to reflect the new capital requirements announced by the Financial Regulator in March, while Anglo Irish Bank, on foot of a request by the Commission, submitted a revised plan on 31 May 2010. It is too early to assess when final approval of the restructuring plans for these institutions will be granted by the Commission.

To the extent that the gap is not filled by the private sector the State is willing to convert some or all of its preference shares as required on terms to be agreed that will provide full value for the State. Accordingly, I am not in a position at this stage to say how the dividend rate on the State's preference share investment in the bank will be affected.

However, arrangements were put in place on an administrative basis between the Chief Justice and the Revenue Commissioners in April 2009 to facilitate voluntary payments by members of the Judiciary in the context of the pension related deduction scheme.  I have no function in relation to those arrangements. However, I understand that information in relation to the voluntary payments in 2009 was published in Revenue's Annual Report for that year. This showed that by 31 December 2009, 109 Judges had paid, or made arrangements to make voluntary payments, under these arrangements. The Annual Report also showed that payments amounting to just over  €652,000 had been received by the Commissioners by that date. In addition, commitments via standing orders, etc, which amounted to €56,800 per month, had been given. I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that arrangements with individual judges are personal information and are confidential.  The Deputy may be aware that Section 161 of the Finance Act 2010 replaced the administrative arrangements mentioned above by providing for a voluntary scheme which enables members of the Judiciary to make a gift to the State of an equivalent amount to the pension related deduction imposed on State employees under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Subsection (8) of that Section specifically provides that:"(8) The Revenue Commissioners shall publish for each year of assessment only details of the number of donors who avail of this scheme in the year, and the aggregate amounts gifted for the year".The Deputy will appreciate that in view of this provision, personal information such as names cannot be published and neither can information in respect of voluntary payments in 2010 under the Section 161 arrangements be published at this stage, but I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that it is their intention to publish aggregate information in accordance with section 161(8) after the end of the year of assessment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, they do not comment or provide details on individual cases except as provided for by law. The settlement of €799,928 paid by Donegal County Council arising from a Revenue audit was published in Iris Oifigiúil in respect of the period beginning on 1 January 2010 and ending on 31 March 2010. The settlement was made in respect of an under-declaration of PAYE/PRSI and comprised the payment of tax in the amount of €547,775 and the payment of interest and penalties in the amount of €252,153.I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information in relation to tax settlements is not maintained separately for local authorities, State or semi-State authorities. As I advised the Deputy when replying to a number of similar questions recently, the Revenue Commissioners maintain sectoral audit records on the basis of an internationally recognised 4 digit NACE Code system. NACE code classifications in tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf. While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided as follows: The Commissioners have identified the following codes to be the most relevant to the Deputy's questions: 7511 — General (overall) public service activities; 7512 — Regulation of the activities of agencies that provide health care, education, cultural services and other social services, excluding social security; 8511 — Hospital activities; 8514 — Other human health activities. The first two codes cover many Government Departments as well as other Government Agencies.Furthermore, the Commissioners have advised me that they have attempted to exclude obvious private sector bodies, which are also included in those NACE Codes because of the activities they are engaged in. On that basis, the following information may be helpful:Category20062007200820092010 (to March)Total Number of Audits20362694Number yielding15282174Tax*€1,043,571€3,601,000€1,696,000€99,000€576,000Interest€524,225€406,000€140,000€6,000€91,000Penalties€240,100€246,000€82,000€17,000€168,000Total Yield€1,807,896€4,253,000€1,918,000€122,000€835,000Number Nil yielding5852—*A breakdown on a tax head basis is not available without conducting an extensive investigation of the individual audit records of the cases.A similar breakdown is not available for years prior to 2006 as this information was not held in a similar format and is not easily accessible at this stage.Where material issues, giving rise to tax undercharges, arise in the course of an audit, Revenue will pursue payments for interest and penalties. Where it is clear that a taxpayer has broadly done their best to ensure that the tax returns for the various taxes are accurate, adjustments are not made for small inaccuracies.Revenue also informs me that, as well as audits, it carries out a range of assurance checks to supplement general audit activity. All such interventions are initiated with the intention of assuring Revenue, without recourse to a resource intensive audit or enforcement activity, that the customer is broadly compliant for the taxes and duties, which are the subject of the intervention. Over 350,000 such checks were carried out in 2009 and would have included public bodies. Due to the volume of these assurance checks, they are not recorded by sector.The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies is very clear as to the standard of tax compliance expected from such bodies.  The following is a quotation taken directly from the Code: "State bodies should be exemplary in their compliance with taxation laws and should ensure that all tax liabilities are paid on time on or before the relevant due dates."The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they have emphasised these requirements on many occasions.  Most recently, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners personally wrote to the Secretaries General of all Government Departments highlighting the subject of tax compliance in the context of the corporate governance responsibilities of Departments and their Agencies / Public Bodies in the exercise of their official duties. She advised that tax compliance is a matter that should be part of the corporate governance framework and, in particular, the risk management processes of these organisations. Revenue supplied information on the common issues that arise for Public Bodies under all tax heads.At a local level, Revenue Districts have engaged proactively with public bodies in advising them of their tax and duty obligations.  Revenue officials have made presentations to the Heads of Finance of Government Departments and the Finance Officers of Local Authorities at which tax compliance matters were discussed and contact points given to be used if further tax information or clarification was required.The Deputy may also be interested to know that Revenue is working closely with representatives (generally finance managers) of County and City managers to support compliance ab initio in relation to the introduction of VAT to Local Authorities from 1 July 2010.  As part of this communication initiative, wide ranging discussions have taken place on general tax and duty compliance issues.

One of the key changes is to the filing of CAT returns (Forms IT38).  A new simplified paper form has been developed and may be used where the following conditions are met:no relief/exemption/credit is claimed, apart from the small gift exemption;the benefit taken is an absolute interest without conditions or restrictions; andthe property included in the return was taken from only one disponer (that is, the person making the gift or leaving the inheritance) and is not part of a larger benefit.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that about 75% of all inheritance tax cases are non-taxable.  Of the taxable inheritances, it is estimated that the new simplified return can be used in about 25% of cases.  Where any other relief/exemption/credit is being claimed, the return must be filed electronically through Revenue's On-line Service (ROS).  Returns through ROS may be made by the taxpayer or by a practitioner (for example, a solicitor or accountant) acting on his or her behalf.  Reliefs from CAT can be very significant; for example, agricultural and business property reliefs can reduce the taxable values by 90% and dwelling house relief gives a full exemption.CAT is also one of the more complex taxes resulting in many calculations and potential adjustments.  Online filing and calculation reduces the scope for error and miscalculation.  The online form is relatively simple and quick to complete as only questions that are pertinent to the return are presented for answers. As information is entered, the system progressively customises the return screens that have to be completed, thus minimising the number of screens and options presented.Furthermore, the 2009 Report of the Commission on Taxation recommended that where data on "tax expenditures" are required to facilitate evaluation and cost-benefit analysis, taxpayers availing of the tax reliefs should be required to e-file their tax returns. The opportunity was taken to implement the Commission's recommendation for CAT as part of the modernisation and simplification changes.In summary, the CAT modernisation process has provided a much simpler paper system for 25% of cases, and in cases where electronic filing is mandatory, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it would be very unusual for a person claiming the more complex reliefs not to be represented by a practitioner.  If an individual taxpayer in the more complex cases is not using a practitioner and has genuine capacity difficulties in relation to online filing, that individual can contact Revenue directly to discuss his or her individual circumstances and will be facilitated as far as possible.

As regards closing savings accounts, Halifax requires written confirmation either by letter or by completing   a closure form.  On the form customers can elect to receive their funds electronically to another account or by cheque.  Halifax has information on its website with regard to how customers should process account closures.  The Financial Regulator has been working with Halifax's parent company Bank of Scotland (Ireland) to ensure that consumers' interests are protected in accordance with the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code.

The type of information being sought included amongst other things a list of the locations where insurance companies were having difficulty providing cover as well as an indication of the number of policies they expected not to renew as a result of the flooding.  The reply my Department received provided a breakdown of claims on a county basis.  It did not identify the specific problem locations.  The IIF did indicate however that approximately 98% of those with household insurance currently have flood cover and that its withdrawal at renewal only happens in exceptional cases where there has been repeated flooding.In order to develop a better understanding of the situation, more detailed information is required.  My Department has therefore requested the IIF to provide information on where people are having difficulties in getting flood cover in particular the specific areas/localities.  The OPW has also been asked to outline the extent and location of the flooding problems and what is being done to address them.  It is hoped that both sets of information will be provided shortly. The purpose of seeking information from both sources is to align them and determine the extent of the current problem, particularly from a flood cover perspective.  Such information is necessary as in many cases remedial work may address flooding problems in the short term or over the next number of years thus making flood cover easier to obtain.  This research will provide essential information and context to any future policy decisions in relation to the provision of flood cover.  Finally, it should be noted that my Department is also examining how other countries deal with the provision of flood cover in such circumstances.

For administrative purposes, where an employer makes a payment that refers to a previous year it applies the current tax credits and standard rate cut-off point to the pay.  Where the employee is no longer in the employment, the employer deducts the tax by reference to the amount of the employee's tax credits and standard rate cut-off point, had the payment been made on the date the employee ceased to be employed.The taxpayer in question ceased employment in November 2008 and received the bonus payment in March 2009.  In May and June 2010 the taxpayer's final liability was reviewed for the years 2008 and 2009 and PAYE Balancing Statements issued.  The bonus payment was appropriated to 2008 and the tax to the year 2009.  The tax overpaid in 2009 was offset against the arrears for 2008. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as income tax on bonus payments is not distinguished on the P35 return from income tax on other employment income, it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to provide statistics on the number of recipients of bonus pay or of the tax deducted there from.

Retirement age is different to pension age (the minimum age at which a public servant may draw his or her pension without actuarial reduction).  As I announced in Budget 2010, legislation is in preparation which will provide a new single scheme for new entrants to the public service and for the setting of a maximum retirement age of 70 years.  The Bill will be introduced later this year.

There are two provisions in the legislation governing the assessment of valuations, i.e. revision and revaluation. Revision of valuation is the mechanism used to maintain existing local authority valuations lists.  It is used to add new properties to the list, to amend the valuations of altered properties and to remove demolished or defunct properties from the list.  The valuations of commercial properties at revision are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list. That is to say that they are compared with similar type properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally.  Therefore rising or falling property values have no impact on valuations determined at revision.In a revaluation the entire valuation list for a local authority is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect on 1 January the following year.  To-date revaluations have been completed in South Dublin and Fingal County Councils and the revaluation of Dún Laoghaire County Council in nearing completion.  The Commissioner of Valuation is responsible for the administration of the Valuation Act and is independent in the exercise of his duties under the act and I as Minister for Finance have no function in decisions in this regard.

However, the Central Bank Act 1942 requires my approval for an annual statement by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) of proposed income and expenditure specifying the amounts to be raised by levies in respect of financial regulation.  Once I have approved it, the statement is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, the annual report of the IFSRA which shows the outcome of income and expenditure in the previous year is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.The CBFSAI has advised me that over the last five years some 50 per cent of the total costs of the Financial Regulator have been met by the imposition of levies on the industry.  The balance of the total annual costs is provided by the CBFSAI in accordance with Section 33(L) of the Central Bank Act 1942.

The annual excise duty payable on each off-licence was increased from €250 to €500.  An off-licence selling the full range of alcohol products requires three licences — spirits, beer and wine.  Consequently, supermarkets who wish to sell wine, beer and spirits must obtain Retailers Off Licences which usually cost €1,500 per annum.  It was decided not to apply a graduated scale of renewal fee charges, based on turnover, to off-licences.  In that context it should be noted that while a graduated scale of renewal fee charges apply in the case of pub licences, the maximum rate of excise duty paid is €3,805, and that in excess of 80% of pubs pay licence duty of under €1,500.

The full text of the Australian DTA can be found on the Revenue website at: http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/ law/double/australia.html The effect of the DTA may be summarised as follows: The purpose of a DTA is the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. Double taxation arises where the same income or gain is taxed by two jurisdictions. This normally occurs where income or gains arise in one country and are paid to a resident of another country. DTAs seek to allocate exclusive taxing rights to one or other country for particular items of income or, where the DTA allows items of income or gains to remain taxable in both countries, to require the country of residence of the taxpayer to grant credit against its tax on the income or gain for the tax paid in the other country.In relation to the Australian DTA, business profits earned by a resident of one country from sources in the other country are taxable only in the country of residence of the taxpayer unless that taxpayer has a permanent establishment in the other country. If there is a permanent establishment then the other country can tax the profits earned through it and in such circumstances the country of residence will give a credit for such tax.Dividends paid by a company resident in one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed at a rate of 15% in the first-mentioned country. The country of residence will give a credit for such tax. Note however that Ireland does not impose any tax on dividends paid to residents of Australia (or any other treaty country). Similarly, payments of interest or royalties from one country to a resident of the other may be taxed in the paying country at a rate of 10% and the country of residence of the taxpayer will give a credit for such tax. Income and gains derived by a resident of one country from immovable property situated in the other country may be taxed in both the country where the immovable property is situated and also in the country of residence of the alienator. The country of residence will grant a credit for such tax.Income from employment of a resident of one country may be taxed in the other country if the employment is exercised there. However, the income will be taxable only in the country of residence of the taxpayer if the presence in the other country is less than 183 days in the tax year and the employer is not resident in the other country and does not have a permanent establishment there. Pensions are taxable only in the country of residence of the taxpayer. Where a taxpayer is resident for tax purposes in both countries at the same time according to their laws, there are tie-breaker provisions in the DTA that decide which country the taxpayer will be treated as a resident of for the purposes of the DTA. For individuals the main test is where the individual has a permanent home.

I also met members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs.  Having reflected on the views expressed, I introduced at Report Stage of the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 on 1 July 2010, eight significant measures which amended the section 35 proposals in the Bill as published and imposed an obligation on the Central Bank to establish an advisory group on credit unions. The measures relating to section 35 accord precisely with proposals circulated to the representative bodies on 10 June 2010 and which I put on the record of Dáil Éireann at Committee Stage.The full eight measures are as follows:1. The proposed sections 35A and 35B in the Bill as published are deleted.2. The easing of section 35 lending limits is now linked directly with the necessary balancing provisions in a cohesive framework within section 35.3. A specific statement is introduced in section 35(2C) meaning that the Central Bank may give notice to credit unions in relation to lending requirements only where it considers it necessary for the adequate protection of members' savings.4. A further new provision means that in applying requirements in relation to lending by credit unions, the Central Bank must have regard to the lending framework provided for in section 35.5. Wider powers originally intended for the Central Bank in relation to loans or specified classes or types of loans [under section 35(A)(1) as published] have been dropped.6. Wider powers to enable the Central Bank to impose requirements other than by making rules [under section 35A(3) as published] have also been dropped.7. The systems, controls and reporting requirements originally provided for in Section 35(A)(1)(f) are now specifically tied into the lending requirements in the section.8. The Central Bank must establish an advisory group on the exercise of its powers and functions relating to credit unions.Taken together, these measures represent a significant package of changes which will establish a lending framework through which the Registrar of Credit Unions can give notice of requirements arising from the relaxation of lending limits provided for in the section 35 in a prudent, balanced and proportionate manner but no more than that. The new advisory group will provide a forum through which the Bank will access the views of credit unions in a more effective and direct way.Reasonable conditions and generous transitional arrangements will also apply in relation to the new section 35 provisions. For example, the Registrar of Credit Unions wrote to all credit unions on 24 May 2010 indicating that the transitional arrangements will include a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments. This should help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011 and allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime. Overall, the Registrar will take account of individual circumstances in credit unions in exercising the powers being given to him in the Bill. There is no question of a “one size fits all” approach as is being suggested by the League.The section 35 amendments passed by Dáil Éireann on 1 July 2010 go a considerable way towards meeting the reasonable concerns of credit unions. At the same time, there is an irreducible minimum level of protection which depositors, credit union members and the general public are entitled to expect. Overall, the measures which have been brought forward provide for this level of protection. I believe that constructive engagement and dialogue with the credit union movement are both necessary and appropriate. Credit unions have a valuable role to play in Ireland and my primary motivation and concern is to put in place conditions in which the movement can be sustained and developed over the coming years. My Department and I are willing and anxious to engage with the credit union representative bodies and to discuss issues of concern including the implementation of the statutory changes provided for in the Central Bank Reform Bill. But it is not possible, of course, to give a veto to any group in relation to its own regulation and I feel sure the Credit Union-related organisations would not expect that.

This is reflective of factors including the relatively large import content of processed food and our peripheral geographical location. However, in the twelve months to May 2010, the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages has fallen by 6 per cent in Ireland but remained unchanged on average in the EU as a whole. I would therefore expect to see noticeable convergence when the 2010 data are published next year. Between 2000 and 2010 the non-contributory state pension increased by 59 per cent in real terms while jobseekers' allowance increased by 60 per cent in real terms. Any decision with regard to social welfare rates of payment is a matter for Government for the 2011 Budget.

The total cost of purchase was €1.5m. A sum of €6,129.00 incl. VAT was expended on upgrading works to the facade of the building in August 2006. A further sum of €1,010.15 incl. VAT was spent on removal of graffiti and making good, etc. in December 2006. Ongoing electricity costs amounts to approx. €4,750.00 per annum. There are no direct insurance costs, as the State carries its own insurance. Planning permission to convert the building for use as a Driving Test Centre has been granted and we would propose to proceed with this development when funding becomes available. I am aware that a number of voluntary bodies and organisations have expressed an interest in the past in acquiring the property. However, as the building is not deemed to be surplus to State requirements, it is not feasible at this time to make it available to any such body, even on a temporary basis.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million. There are no plans to reverse these changes.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available. The remaining care provision is subject to prior approval, which will be required from a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for:High risk and exceptional patients,Those requiring emergency care, andPatients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.Where prior approval is required for the treatment, the HSE Principal Dental Surgeons will apply their professional judgment to determine, in the circumstances, whether or not there is a clinical emergency, and whether or not treatment should therefore be approved.I have given no direction to the HSE concerning what constitutes a clinical emergency. In the DTSS an emergency is determined by the treating clinician, the contracted General Dental Practitioner, in agreement with the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon, or a delegate who is also a clinician. Where a patient requires dental treatment in advance of urgent medical treatment, this must be communicated to the HSE Principal Dental Surgeon. The manner in which this approval is sought has not changed and is a matter for those involved in the process.The staff of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the HSE are aware of the changes and are implementing them. The HSE will continue to engage with dental professionals to ensure clarity and consistency in implementing these changes. The HSE will also monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 211, 215 and 216 together.The project continues to be a priority for the Government and the HSE.  Following work with the HSE's senior management, St. Vincent's Hospital and the Department of Finance, I announced in 2009 that the project would proceed to construction on the basis that the building will be paid for at the end of the construction phase.  The site at the hospital is cleared and ready for construction to commence and the HSE's capital funding remains ring-fenced for the new development. The 100 inpatient bed unit (in single en-suite rooms) will accommodate many other patients whose medical requirements necessitate single en suite facilities and reflects best practice in terms of infection control. It will also provide 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.In the normal course payments for construction of a project such as this would have been phased over the construction period.   However under the financing method being utilised for this project, the construction company will source bridging finance for the project until the construction is complete.  Following receipt of tenders for construction, the procurement process  has been particularly difficult and protracted in this case, due to prevailing conditions in the Irish construction industry.  The Hospital has now issued a "letter of intent" to a preferred bidder in the tender process for the building of the new ward block.It is hoped to award the contract in the next few weeks after which construction of the new facility will take about 18 months. The process is under continuous review in order to ensure earliest possible delivery of the new ward block.  St Vincent's University Hospital and the HSE remain committed to this project, and are taking every possible step to expedite contract award and earliest commencement of construction on site.

In line with the Report, a ‘Palliative Care Services Medium Term Development Framework' was published by the HSE in July 2009. This Framework sets national priorities which have been agreed by all stakeholders based on solid needs analysis. The national priorities reflect the gaps that currently exist in particular areas and services, and the prioritisation reflects the largest gaps. The national priorities selected are aligned to national healthcare policy and the HSE's Transformation Programme and Corporate Plan. However, all developments are subject to current budget and economic considerations.As the specific issue raised by the Deputy is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Section 36 of the Health Act, 2004 also requires the HSE to prepare Annual Financial Statements (AFS), on an income and expenditure basis.  The AFS are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and they are, together with the audit report, laid before the Oireachtas and are examined by the Committee of Public Accounts alongside the Appropriation Account.  The accounts of hospitals established by statute are also audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and laid before the Oireachtas.  The audited accounts of other service providers funded by the HSE under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 are submitted to the HSE for its examination as part of the framework for accountability in respect of the delivery of services and the expenditure of public funds. The arrangements by the HSE with such service providers also encompass reporting and monitoring arrangements in respect of the provision of services and associated expenditure.The above position reflects the general arrangements governing the financial and service accountability of the HSE and the service providers it funds.  If there are specific matters giving rise to the Deputy's enquiries I will be happy to have these addressed by the HSE.

It also endorsed the National Plan for Radiation Oncology (NPRO) which had been approved by Government in 2005.  This Plan was based on the recommendations in The Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland, otherwise known as the Hollywood Report, which was published in 2003.  This recommended that there should be two centres in the East in order to cater for radiotherapy needs.Extensive consultation formed part of the Group's deliberations in producing the Hollywood Report.  A study was commissioned to investigate patient priorities in the development of new radiation oncology services. The aim was to ensure that future service developments would be based on best practice and sensitive to patient needs, preferences and priorities. The study included a series of focus groups and a postal questionnaire, sent by random sample to all major cancer groups who had completed their first course of radiotherapy.The Members of the Expert Working Group on Radiation Oncology Services, which produced the 2003 Hollywood Report, are listed below.NameOrganisationPositionProf. Donal Hollywood (Chair)St. Luke’s Hospital, Trinity CollegeProfessor of Clinical OncologyDr John ArmstrongSt. Luke’s HospitalConsultant Radiation OncologistMs Mary CoffeyTrinity College DublinDirector, School of Radiation TherapyDr Harry ComberNational Cancer RegistryDirector, National Cancer RegistryDr Tom ConereCork University HospitalChief PhysicistMr Joseph CreganDepartment of Health and ChildrenPrincipal OfficerMs Yvonne DavidsonCork University HospitalBusiness Manager, Division of OncologyDr Ruth EakinNorthern Ireland Cancer CentreConsultant Clinical OncologistDr Liam GroganBeaumont HospitalConsultant Medical OncologistMr Wilfrid HigginsDepartment of Health and ChildrenEngineering AdvisorDr Tony HolohanDepartment of Health and ChildrenDeputy Chief Medical OfficerDr Maurice HurleyCork University HospitalConsultant Clinical OncologistMs Joan KellyIrish Cancer SocietyNursing Services ManagerDr Marie LaffoyEastern Regional Health AuthorityDirector of Public HealthMs Eileen MaherSt Luke’s HospitalDirector of NursingDr Brendan McCleanSt Luke’s HospitalChief PhysicistDr Regina McQuillanSt Francis HospiceConsultant Palliative Care PhysicianDr Aiden MeadeIrish College of General PractitionersGeneral PractitionerDr Seamus O’CathailCork University HospitalConsultant Radiation OncologistDr Bernadette O’KeefeDepartment of Health and ChildrenDeputy Chief Medical OfficerMs Ber RyanAid Cancer Treatment (ACT)Patient AdvocateDr Sheelah RyanWestern Health BoardChief Executive OfficerMr Gordon WatsonSouth Eastern Health BoardConsultant Surgeon*Organisational attachments are as applicable at the time of completion of the report.Following publication of the Hollywood Report, the Chief Medical Officer was asked by the then Minister for Health and Children to advise on the location of radiation oncology services in the Eastern Region.  A panel of national and international experts was established to assist in the process. A request for proposals for the development of radiation oncology services in the Eastern Region was issued to six hospitals in Dublin. The document set out the evaluation criteria against which the proposals would be assessed. Six hospitals submitted proposals. These were evaluated by the Expert Panel. Based on the advice of the Panel, I announced in 2005 that radiation oncology services in the Eastern Region should be located at Beaumont and St James's Hospital.  This entailed the eventual transfer of St Luke's staff and resources to the new centres.As part of the implementation of the 2006 National Cancer Control Strategy, the HSE set up an Advisory Group to assist it in configuring the managed cancer control networks and identifying the designated cancer centres.  Combined modality treatment, delivered by multi-disciplinary teams, was a key requirement for the designated cancer centres.  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme was launched in 2007.  It set out the configuration of the cancer services in such centres, and identified the 8 designated cancer centres, including Beaumont and St James's Hospitals.The two new radiotherapy centres at St James's and Beaumont Hospitals will open at end 2010/early 2011 under Phase 1 of the NPRO, providing significant additional capacity for public patients. These centres will be under the governance of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme. The existing radiotherapy centre at St Luke's and these new centres at Beaumont and St James's will together form the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network. This will allow for seamless patient transfer between services and more effective, patient-centred services, resulting in best outcomes for patients.  Some staff and resources of St Luke's will transfer to other sites in the St Luke's Network in the second half of 2010. Radiotherapy services will continue to be delivered at St Luke's until at least the end of 2014. At that stage, additional capacity is scheduled to come on stream under Phase 2 of the NPRO and the remaining staff and resources will transfer from St Luke's.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.I brought forward at Committee stage an amendment to the Adoption Bill 2009 that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt.  The proposed amendment requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year and which provides a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.The table below sets out the number of pre-school services participating in the ECCE scheme, and the number of children enrolled in the ECCE scheme, broken down by City and County Childcare Committee (CCC) area, for the period up to June 2010.  It should be noted that the figure for the number of services counts all services, including where both a 38-week sessional service and a 50-week fullday service in the same facility are participating in the scheme.  In total, there are approximately 4,350 participating services in 3,800 facilities.  The number of children participating in the scheme amounts to some 53,000, which amounts to approximately 83% of children in their pre-school year.  This is in addition to another 5% of children who receive their free pre-school year through other pre-existing State-funded schemes.  While there remain a small number of late transfers and appeals to administer, it is not anticipated that these figures will change significantly for the January-August 2010 ‘short' pre-school year.Applications from pre-school services to participate in the ECCE scheme for the year commencing in September 2010 are currently being processed by the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  In addition to the re-applications from existing services in the scheme, 570 new applications have been recieved in respect of facilities seeking to enter the scheme from September.  This would include both existing pre-schools and creches that did not enter the scheme from January, and new services that have been established in response to the demand created by the scheme.All participating services will be required to make a return to my Office in September, giving details of qualifying children attending.  When the processing of these returns is finalised, details of numbers participating will be available by reference to the areas covered by the City and County Childcare Committees.The child intake in September 2010 is expected to be higher than in January, based on a number of factors, including an increase in the birthrate over the period 2005-2007, and the fact that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2006 could either to enrol in January 2010 and avail of 23 weeks of the scheme, or enrol in September 2010 and avail of 38 weeks of the scheme.  It is also expected that the success of the scheme in the first year will enourage even higher levels of participation in what will be the first full year of the scheme.The scheme has proved to be very popular with the large majority of parents and service providers.  While some services have sought to have the scheme amended, to allow them charge parental fees in addition to the capitation fees they recieve, doing so would mean that the scheme was no longer free to all families regardless of income, and that is a key feature of this scheme.  I believe that the high levels of participation in the scheme demonstrate that the capitation fee, of €64.50 per week for a pre-school place, rising to €75 per week in services with higher levels of staff qualifications, is sufficient to allow services meet the high standards of the scheme, and make a fair profit.ServicesChildrenCarlow50691Cavan61970Clare1411,471Cork City891,161Cork County3224,756Donegal1332,017Dublin City3313,462Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown1831,886Fingal3243,529Galway2873,133Kerry1301,615Kildare2402,902Kilkenny1111,163Laois861,102Leitrim38483Limerick City52668Limerick County1351,678Longford45494Louth1341,561Mayo1261,522Meath2152,653Monaghan58881Offaly67969Roscommon59723Sligo67717South Dublin2292,684Tipperary North77872Tipperary South791,142Waterford City43628Waterford County51710Westmeath1001,234Wexford1361,918Wicklow1481,764

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	602	GPs who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated principally on the basis of fees and payments set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009.  Prior to that, these fees and payments had been agreed as part of the GMS GP contract and amended as appropriate in line with normal wage agreements.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees.  The fees vary depending on the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP's surgery.  For example, fees currently range from €76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP's surgery to €218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of €280.31 for persons over 70 residing at home and €896.07 for persons over 70 residing in private nursing homes.  There is also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.In 2009, payments to GPs for services provided under the GMS and other primary care schemes amounted to €489,862 million.  A detailed breakdown of this figure is not yet available.  The total payments to GPs over the years 2004 to 2008 for the GMS Scheme are set out in the table below.20082007200620052004(000’s)(000’s)(000’s)(000’s)(000’s)Total Payments€459,476€427,418€391,029€403,071€306,250I have recently completed the review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed by the Regulations mentioned above.  This review was carried out in accordance with Section 9 (13) of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act (FEMPI) 2009.Following this review, I have decided to initiate a consultation process under the FEMPI Act to explore the scope for further reductions in fees paid to General Practitioners.  An appropriate public announcement will be made when the consultation process commences.

Section 39 agencies are not public service bodies as defined in that Act and their employees are not public servants. However, the grant funding of Section 39 Agencies is subject to the general efficiency savings for the health sector provided for in the Budget.   Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate that Section 39 Agencies and other HSE funded voluntary providers take appropriate measures to ensure that they continue to provide the same level of service in 2010 as previously, notwithstanding the reductions in their funding.  It is the responsibility of each individual employer to decide exactly what mix of actions should be taken to achieve this goal, to take appropriate legal and other advice, to consult and inform its employees/trade unions as necessary and to manage the HR and industrial relations implications of its decisions.

Compliance with the directive is good for patient safety.  It serves no good purpose to have over-stretched, over-tired junior doctors treating patients.  It is particularly important in smaller hospitals, where there may be a greater tendency to rely on overtime, that progression to EWTD compliance is a priority.As the precise level of progress made is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.  I can confirm that significant progress on compliance has been made in recent years, in particular the past 12 months, following implementation of Labour Court Recommendation No. 19559, which provided for the introduction of EWTD compliant work patterns, rotas, rosters and on-call arrangements for NCHDs.  In the short term further progress may be affected by the current shortage of NCHDs.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	631	In the process of re-negotiating a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption with Vietnam serious issues came to light in relation to the Vietnamese adoption process. The issues were contained in the report on intercountry adoption commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and carried out by International Social Services (ISS).  An earlier report published last August by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) was also considered in this regard. The UNICEF/ISS report, which was accepted by the Vietnamese Government, "proposes that Vietnam suspends intercountry adoptions for the necessary period during the year 2010 that will enable it to ensure optimal implementation of the Hague Convention and to prepare for the entry into force of the new law on adoption in 2011".  The Report also raised serious questions regarding adoption practices in Vietnam, including as follows:(a) inter-country adoptions from Vietnam are essentially influenced by foreign demand, i.e. the availability of children who are "adoptable" abroad corresponds more to the existence of foreign prospective adopters than to the actual needs of "abandoned" and orphaned children;(b) the circumstances under which babies become "adoptable" are invariably unclear and disturbing;(c) the inter-country adoption  system is grounded in a remarkably unhealthy relationship between the mediating agencies and specific residential facilities; and(d) Governments and central authorities of "receiving countries" collectively at least, and individually in many instances have not effectively committed themselves to applying the basic principles of the Hague Convention or the recommendations of the treaty's practical operation, in their dealings with Vietnam.Having considered the contents of the two reports the Government decided, on 13th of January, to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral intercountry adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of this decision, all intercountry adoptions from Vietnam will be suspended until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and both Ireland and Vietnam have ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention. The Adoption Bill completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas last week.It is my understanding that the Vietnamese Government has recently passed legislation which should allow Vietnam to move to ratification of the Hague Convention. In the event that both Ireland and Vietnam ratify the Convention there is every reason to expect that adoptions from Vietnam could re-commence subject to the provisions of the Convention being met in this regard.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the drug Sativex which has recently been licensed in the UK for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.The current legal position in Ireland in relation to cannabis and cannabis based medicinal products such as Sativex is that they are Schedule 1 controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. All Schedule 1 substances are substances which are considered as having no medicinal use and the manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis and cannabis derivatives is unlawful except for the purposes of research.My Department is aware that claims have been made in respect of Sativex and its possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis and cancer.  As the law currently stands it would not be possible for Sativex to be licensed here for medicinal use or for a General Practitioner to prescribe it. As cannabis is the drug which is most abused in Ireland, I am reluctant to loosen the controls on its use. However, I am seeking expert clinical advice in this matter and I am open to making a change to the Misuse of Drugs legislation to allow for the use of medicinal cannabis based drugs such as Sativex, if the expert advice indicates that a change is warranted.

The building of a 54 bed replacement facility for the remaining patients will commence this year and is due to be completed by mid-2012.A new acute psychiatric unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the acute admission unit at St Ita's, will also commence later this year and is expected to be completed by April, 2012.  The local mental health management team is preparing contingency plans to deal with the cessation of new admissions from 1 March 2011. A number of other units in St. Ita's will be refurbished before 30 November 2010.In relation to St Senan's Hospital all acute admissions will transfer to the acute psychiatric unit at Waterford Regional Hospital in 2011. In 2010/2011 the HSE will invest some €18m in the development of community based services which will include a crisis housing, high support residence and a community nursing unit.  These developments will enable St. Senan's to close by December 2011.

Government policy in relation to Palliative Care continues to be based on the Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (2001). In line with the Report, a ‘Palliative Care Services Medium Term Development Framework' was published by the HSE in July 2009. This Framework sets national priorities which have been agreed by all stakeholders, based on solid needs analysis.  However, all future spending and developments are subject to current budget and economic considerations.

It is expected that the Report will develop a framework based on best international practice and up to date research to guide the transfer of identified individuals from congregated settings to a community based setting.The HSE has informed me that the Report of the Review Group on Congregated Settings is currently at an advanced stage of preparation. Among the issues under consideration by the Group is the setting up of a number of demonstration sites to validate the main recommendations on a proposed new model of service delivery. In addition to the Review on Congregated Settings, a HSE Review of the provision of Adult Day Services for people with disabilities has been completed.My Department is also engaging in a Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services as part of the Government's Value for Money Reviews for 2009-2011. This in-depth review of Disability Services will assess how well current services for people with disabilities are meeting their objectives and support the future planning and development of services within the appropriate policy framework.  The evaluation will focus on the current provision of disability services and explore the way forward for the development of services within a value for money context.All of these policy initiatives are being informed by principles of mainstreaming, community inclusion, independence and choice. A structured consultation process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families, will be an integral part of bringing these policy reviews and their recommendations to finality.

Furthermore, I have requested that the HSE validate, as a matter of urgency, the methodology used to calculate the reductions in allocations for the various agencies.  I have also requested details of those service providers who are continuing to provide respite services, despite the reduction in their allocation, in order to determine the factors which lead to a decision on the part of a service provider to reduce or close respite services.With respect to the Bawnmore services, preliminary data provided indicates that the funding reductions implemented by HSE West are in line with the budget reductions applied to HSE services generally and do not compare unfavourably with the average figures presented for the HSE Section 38 agencies nationally.The overall budget for the Brothers of Charity services in the Limerick area is €25 million. The Brothers have indicated that the respite service can be largely restored for €150,000 in the current year. The HSE has given a commitment to continuing to actively engage with the Brothers of Charity services locally.

The development costs for the hospital are currently under detailed review by the Board.  The development will be funded through a combination of direct Exchequer funding and other sources, including philanthropic contributions.  The overall development costs will be known following completion of the competitive tendering exercise and are expected to reflect the increased value for money currently applying to large construction contracts.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	676	The Government has made it clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years.The Employment Control Framework for the health sector provides for a net reduction in employment of 6,000 in wholetime equivalent (WTE) terms from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE. Therefore, the net target reduction in numbers in 2010, and in each of the following two years, is 1,520 wholetime equivalents.The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained insofar as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people, persons with a disability, mental health services, and cancer services. The Framework, accordingly, provides for a number of grades and posts that are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and promotion.In addition, the HSE also has some degree of flexibility under the Framework to sanction the filling of certain other posts (both within its own organisation and in voluntary service providers funded it by it) on an exceptional basis provided it achieves the overall target reductions in both staffing levels and pay costs. The requirement is that a post or posts of equivalent value must be suppressed in order to meet the cost of the post being filled.Against the background of reduced budgets and staffing levels in the health sector, a reorganisation and restructuring of work is required not only to maintain the level, quality and safety of services but also to expand the range and accessibility of community services in order to avoid the necessity for hospital attendances. The new Public Service Agreement, recently ratified by the Public Services Committee of ICTU, clears the way for the implementation of a major transformation programme for the health sector to commence on a collaborative basis involving unions and employers.  The programme is designed to achieve significant cost efficiencies while protecting the quality and effectiveness of services to the public.The position in regard to the management of employment levels in specific areas is a service matter, and the Deputy's question has accordingly been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 to 309, inclusive, together.The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.The Board of the HSE approved the selection of preferred bidders for the Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospital co-location projects in July 2007.  Project agreements were signed for the Beaumont, Cork, and Limerick projects in March 2008.  The St James's project agreement was signed in December 2008. Planning permission was granted by An Bord Pleanála for the Beaumont project in November 2008 and for the Limerick project in May 2009. The Cork project received planning permission from An Bord Pleanála in June 2009.  An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the St James's project in June 2010.Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant project agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.The Finance Act 2009 provides for the termination of the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development. Where planning permission is required, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission must have been submitted and acknowledged by the relevant planning authority on or before that date. In such cases, the termination date in the case of qualifying hospitals is 31 December 2013.Provided that a hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  This includes co-location projects if they arrange their financing on the basis of the capital allowances scheme. The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure incurred.  No tax expenditure has been incurred so far and none will be incurred until construction is completed and services are opened.The HSE has estimated that, from the start of building, the overall construction and commissioning period for the projects will range from about 28 to 36 months, depending on the scale of the project.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The report on the Study of Young Carers in the Irish Population was published in May, 2010.  As I indicated at the time, the study is preliminary and exploratory in nature. It is clear from the study that the identification of and reaching young carers is, in itself, challenging. In that respect the report highlights the importance of creating a better understanding of children as carers in Ireland.My Office have requested  the Central Statistics Office to include a question in its Census of Population 2011, to be asked of people of all ages, on whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability. I understand this will happen, and will improve our knowledge of the extent to which children and young people in the population are involved in caring activities.It is also clear that the response to the needs of young carers will need to be cross-sectoral, multidepartmental and multi-agency.  It is anticipated that further assessment of how to better identify young carers and co-ordinate existing supports will be undertaken in the new National Children's Strategy in conjunction with the relevant Departments and agencies including the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education and the Health Service Executive.

As a matter of principle, I would encourage their use in appropriate locations, subject to adequate attention being given on a case by case basis to issues such as the management of traffic from such lanes at junctions, and wider safety issues for users.

The first operational payments in relation to these projects arose in 2007 and, as indicated in response to an earlier question from the Deputy, I have been advised by the National Roads Authority (NRA) that an operational payment of  €4.6m. was made in that year in respect of one project.Since 2008 funding has been provided from a specific subhead in my Department's current budget to cover operational payments for the NRA's roads programme as follows:2008 €7.936 million;2009 €7.936 million.The amount allocated in the Department's vote for 2010 for this subhead is €51million and it is expected that the provision for operational payments under this programme will peak in 2011 at around €85 million.  The final figure payable each year is determined by the inflation rate.The NRA has initiated a second PPP roads programme and tender competitions in relation to a number of projects are currently underway.  The timing and amount of PPP payments in respect of these projects will depend on final contractual arrangements.  It is not envisaged that payments will arise before 2013 on the schemes included in the second roads PPP programme.The T21 priority public transport projects, Metro North and Dart Underground, will be delivered by PPP. Neither of these projects has as yet received planning approval and the procurement processes are ongoing.Payments associated with these projects can only be established once the procurement process is complete and final contracts signed.

Regulations entitled the Road Traffic (Immobilisation of Vehicles) Regulations were made in 1998 to give effect to that Section.The implementation of these regulations is a matter for the Local Authorities.  Where Local Authorities have contracted private operators for enforcement in relation to public car parking, any issues regarding implementation or the appropriateness of individual decisions to apply clamping are matters for the Local Authorities and the operators to address in the context of their contractual arrangements.

The Regulation has direct application in Member States and the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) has been designated as the National Enforcement Body for the Regulation in the State.Last week, the European Commission launched a European-wide publicity campaign aimed at raising public awareness of passenger's rights and entitlements under Regulation (EC) 261/2004.  As part of the campaign, posters will be displayed in airports in all Member States and passengers will also be able to consult a new dedicated website, the address of which is http://ec.europa.eu/passenger-rights.

Ireland provided a detailed response to the European Commission's reasoned opinion on 7 December 2009.Despite the response it is understood that the European Commission proposes to take court proceedings against Ireland as regards the manner of implementation of Directive 2001/14/EC. Precise details of the exact nature of these proceedings are awaited and Ireland will respond to the proposed proceedings when they are received.

The Department of Transport reviewed this service as part of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes process.In 2008, in preparation for re-tendering, a broad spectrum of Government and other stakeholders contributed to the requirements for the new contract and in the creation of the Request For Tender (RFT). The requirement was advertised in the EU Journal, broadly requiring the continuation of the existing level of service. A process auditor from PA Consulting Ltd oversaw the procurement stages.The change in helicopters, which is the essential difference in the service, is necessitated by safety, certification, maintenance and performance considerations. Final contract details are being completed and signing will take place shortly.

I understand that initially the service started with six sailings per week, which at the beginning were hampered by some technical problems with the vessel.  Volumes carried during this start-up phase as reported by the operator were small but consistent.In April 2010 the volcanic ash cloud that closed European air space boosted passenger volumes utilising the service. During the three week period of air travel uncertainty the vessel was running to capacity most days.  The company also added an additional sailing during the peak of the crisis to facilitate additional national sea ferry capacity.I also understand that following the re-opening of European air space passenger volumes fell slightly but were still higher then expected.  For July and August sailings have been increased to eight per week.  I understand that the company has so far met its initial targets for passenger numbers.I hope that as the service continues to maintain its reliability and frequency more passengers will be attracted to the route.

The selected supplier will provide the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operators.  An Garda Síochána will issue fixed charge notices to speeding drivers who are detected and pursue any court prosecutions undertaken.The service provider will be paid according to the level of service contracted for.  The number of speeding drivers detected will have no effect on the level of payments to the service provider.  The purpose of the contract is to reduce speed, and so increase road safety, and not to generate revenue either for the State or the service provider.

Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to adults, these include a behaviour warning and the making of a civil order by the court.  With regard to children, they range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 31 May, 2010, 1,804 behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and 1,324 to children.  Thirteen good behaviour contracts have been issued to children.  Four civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.In setting up the regime the intention was that interventions short of a court order would address the problem behaviour.  If they succeed, there will be no need to apply to the courts.  It is only if they fail to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question, that a court order will be applied for.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.The person concerned was granted Leave to Remain in the State for a one year period, from 24 June 2003 to 23 June 2004.  He applied for the renewal of this permission and was granted Leave to Remain in the State for a further three years, to 25 May 2007.  His permission to remain was further renewed on 11 June 2007, for a further period of three years, and again on 10 June 2010, to 10 June 2013.

This project was completed in 2001 when the new facilities were brought into use for both training and normal purposes.  The work carried out at the prison facility at Spike Island included, as well as the installation of a new, fully fitted kitchen at the prison, other elements including improvements to office accommodation.  Due to the integrated nature of the project, which was tendered and delivered in one lot, it is not possible to identify and extract the specific costs associated with the kitchen elements.

Operational orders will be prepared in every Garda Region, in particular in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and Border Divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks and police the Halloween period generally.  During the Halloween period, An Garda Síochána will engage with local communities, local authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus and the vintners' associations, while putting plans in place to address the issues that arise at that time.  Through the Schools Programme and other local programmes, members of An Garda Síochána will deliver the message that fireworks are illegal and highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks.  Gardaí will have a liaison mechanism in place with local authorities for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials.  They will also liaise with managers of off-licences to ensure that their staff are aware of their obligations and responsibilities under licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to underage persons.Proactive policing arrangements will be put in place for the period.  Additional patrols will be carried out by uniform personnel as part of high visibility policing initiatives, supported by plain clothes personnel, including District detective and drug units, Divisional crime task force and Traffic Corps personnel and community policing and mounted bike units, supported by public order units as required.  An Garda Síochána will utilise the strong legislative provisions in place to combat anti-social behaviour and the misuse of fireworks, including those in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts 1994 and 2003, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.

That section came into operation on 1 May 2002. Its effect is that, where the relevant conditions have been met, the person is to be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty of or dealt with for an offence and the person may, except as provided for in the section, withhold information about the offence and the circumstances relating to it.At present there is no similar provision in legislation in respect of adult offenders.  However the Spent Convictions Bill 2007 which is currently before the House will address the position of adult offenders. The Bill completed Second Stage on 18 December 2008.  It was introduced in October 2007 as a Private Members Bill by my colleague, Minister Barry Andrews TD. Subsequently, in early 2008, the Government agreed to progress it as a Government Bill.The Bill provides that those who had been subject to a fine or to a sentence of no more than 6 months imprisonment may, after a period of time without further conviction, withhold details of the conviction that gave rise to the fine or the sentence of imprisonment. However, disclosure will always be required in the case of sexual offences and for a small number of other specified offences and in the case of certain posts (for example, child care). The Bill has been reviewed in light of suggestions made at Second Stage and in the course of consultations undertaken by my Department. Mr Andrews and I are now considering a range of matters; these are likely to give rise to amendments at Committee Stage.

The vast majority of the removals involved persons whose asylum applications were refused.Set out below is information for 2009, and 2010 up to 30 June. These figures include the travel costs relating to the deportees and their Garda escorts. The Deputy might wish to note that the figures below do not include the cost of overtime or subsistence payments for Garda escorts.YearCost of DeportationsNumbers Deported€20091,069,634.002912010 (up to 30 June)377,385.71130My Department deports persons to non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries. To identify the ten most expensive deportations would involve a disproportionate use of resources in disaggregating those individual costs from the cost figures quoted above. During the period in question however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the single most expensive deportation involved the removal of a Georgian man in March 2009 at a cost of €35,205.22.In considering the costs of deportations, the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who are the subject of deportation orders has to be taken into account.  These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases.  While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system.  This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The International AIDS Conference, held biennially, is an occasion for partners in the fight against HIV and AIDS to congregate and review progress over the preceding two years, look at the current context and plan for the future.The Irish delegation to the International AIDS Conference in Vienna will include a senior HIV and AIDS advisor from Headquarters, experienced HIV and AIDS advisers from Ethiopia and Uganda, two of Ireland's Programme Countries, and the adviser of Ireland's Regional HIV and AIDS Programme for Eastern and Southern Africa.Ireland has acquired a high profile internationally for its commitment to the fight against HIV/AIDS. Ireland is active and influential in international fora on HIV/AIDS, with a focus on protecting the interests of the worst affected countries and vulnerable populations. The Irish team will provide invaluable experience from the field and learn from the wealth of knowledge that I expect will be disseminated during the conference.Combating HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases is a core priority of Ireland's aid programme and this year we will spend more than €100 million in pursuit of this priority. Our assistance is targeted at those countries most affected by the pandemic including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, South Africa, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi.We support cutting edge research initiatives in the areas of vaccine development and the development of new prevention tools. We invest in empowering women and girls to protect themselves against infection. We support the fight through national governments, civil society programmes, and international public-private partnerships such as the Clinton Foundation.Ireland will be an active participant at the forthcoming conference in Vienna, and we will continue to collaborate with international partners in tackling the HIV and AIDS crisis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 382 together.The achievement of universal access to reproductive health is one of the objectives of the Programme of Action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.  It is also an objective of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted in 2000.  Specifically, the fifth of the eight MDGs is to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015.The 2010 Report on progress towards the MDGs which was launched recently by the UN Secretary General, notes that some progress has been achieved in reducing maternal mortality, with significant progress in a number of countries. However, the rate of reduction is still short of the progress needed if the MDG target is to be met. Fewer than half the women giving birth in Sub Saharan Africa are attended by skilled health personnel. Poor women, especially in rural communities, face particular challenges in accessing antenatal care.  The UN report also notes that poverty and lack of education continue to contribute to high adolescent birth rates in poor countries.  It recognises the link between slow progress on the achievement of universal access to reproductive health care and low levels of empowerment of women and lack of access by girls to secondary education.Through Irish Aid, the Government is working in close cooperation with a number of key UN agencies in the UN to address maternal health issues in developing countries. The implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action forms part of the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with which we have developed a close working partnership.   In recognition of the UNFPA's important mandate, the Government has contributed significant levels of funding to the agency in recent years.  In total, over the six years 2005-2010, the Government has provided €26.5 million for the work of the UNFPA.In addition, through the bilateral aid programme, Irish Aid's regional programmes on malaria and HIV and AIDS promote interventions which contribute significantly to a reduction in mortality in women of reproductive age.  Our support for health sector programmes in African countries in particular, promotes reproductive health and HIV protection for young people. Specific NGO support is also provided to deal with gender based violence. Irish Aid is also supporting maternal health improvements through our global partnerships with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and the International Partnerships for Microbicides.Ireland has made a specific contribution in recent months to preparations for the review of progress on MDG 5 at the forthcoming Review Summit in New York.  Ireland organised a high level panel discussion on maternal mortality at the Commission on the Status of Women at the UN in New York in March.  The theme of the event was Overcoming Barriers and Accelerating Progress towards MDG5.  Discussions focused on how to accelerate progress between now and 2015, defining a number of key actions for policy makers in advance of the Summit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	750	The Government's White Paper on Irish Aid is the framework governing and guiding Ireland's overseas development programme, including the health sector. This overarching policy framework is further elaborated in documents such as Irish Aid's Health Policy and Strategy (2006) and the HIV and AIDS Policy and Strategy which is presently being updated.Health development policies emphasise the importance of responding to the health needs of adolescents and young people with particular emphasis on HIV protection for adolescent girls alongside sexual and reproductive health, including maternal health. This emphasis on the health needs of young girls is justified by compelling evidence of a feminisation of the HIV pandemic in Southern Africa and a pattern of poor access to basic health by young women in poorer settings, which contributes to the unacceptably slow progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5, the reduction of maternal mortality.Ireland's commitment to this policy position is given expression in the Ireland's aid programme through our support to UN Funds, Programmes and Specialised Agencies that work in this area (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNIFEM, UNAIDS) and through our funding and engagement with Global Health Initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Further, Ireland's support for the development of new HIV prevention products is intended to benefit young people in particular, and two regional programmes in Africa dealing with malaria and AIDS give special attention to young women.In Ireland's Programme Countries, young people's health is addressed through our support to the health sector and the national response to HIV and AIDS. Where appropriate, support is provided directly to in-country initiatives dealing with health issues for young people, for example to the Health Equity Network in Tanzania.It is widely recognised that education is a key factor in promoting awareness of health issues amongst vulnerable populations, including young people. Ireland's strong record of support for education in developing countries is significant in this regard.I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland's overseas development programme will continue to address the health needs of adolescents and young people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	751	A substantive partnership with UN Funds and Programmes, and Global Health Initiatives including those tasked with developing new products for neglected diseases, is an important element of Ireland's development cooperation programme and of our contribution to the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals. Ireland engages actively with these organisations, participating in meetings and shaping and influencing policy decisions, and we are generous financial contributors to their work.In 2010 Ireland has provided approximately €9 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, approximately €3 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), €1 million to the International Partnership for Microbicides, €525 000 to the GAVI Alliance (previously known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) and €300,000 to UNIFEM. Future support to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative is under consideration.These organisations contribute to advancing Millennium Development Goals 3, 4, 5 and 6 that are concerned with health, AIDS, gender equality and women's empowerment.UNFPA supports sexual and reproductive health, including maternal health, while Ireland's support to UNIFEM assists action at various levels to address gender equality and to empower women. The Global Fund and GAVI Alliance continue to document the considerable impact they are having on the incidence of deaths associated with AIDS and other communicable diseases, especially amongst children in the poorest regions of the world. The International Partnership for Microbicides plays an important role in strengthening women's capacity to prevent HIV transmission.I believe that engagement with these organisations, each of which has an important contribution to make to the achievement of the MDG goals, will remain an important part of Ireland's overseas development programme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The deaths, injuries and suffering resulting from the actions of the British Army on Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972, brought relations on this island and between Britain and Ireland to breaking point.  This was compounded by the stain which the Widgery report placed on the characters of men now finally and publicly acknowledged to have been innocent.The publication of Lord Saville's report into the events of Bloody Sunday has been widely welcomed, most particularly by the Bloody Sunday families themselves.  On the day after the publication, members of the Bloody Sunday families travelled to Dublin to meet with the Taoiseach and told him of their satisfaction with Prime Minister David Cameron's acknowledgement that the events of that day were ‘unjustified and unjustifiable'. The report vindicates the families' long and dignified campaign to clear their loved ones' names and, in their own words, ‘set the truth free'. I am pleased that successive Governments have been able to play our part in this process.The Saville report is the product of what was one of the longest and most complicated inquiries in legal history: it runs to over 5,000 pages.  The Government, just as the families and their representatives, will take our time to examine it in close detail.  No doubt it will also need to be given careful consideration by the appropriate authorities in the North and in Britain.As the Taoiseach noted in addressing the Dáil last week, the Saville Inquiry was not about re-opening old wounds, but about healing scars left by injustice. The report and the brave and honest words of Prime Minister Cameron in accepting its findings have the potential, I believe, to further the process of reconciliation on this island and between these islands and consolidate peace. These were the sentiments which were expressed in the All Party Motion passed by the House that day.This potential for healing was underlined when, on the morning after the publication, representatives of the Protestant churches — Bishop Good, Moderator Hamilton and President Kingston — joined with Bishop Daly and the families in the Bogside to remember those who died on Bloody Sunday and throughout the Troubles. The spirit of reconciliation shown that day, a spirit which guided the families in their long campaign for truth, can be a solid platform for the future.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Serbia was signed, subject to approval by the parties to it, including Ireland, in Luxembourg on 29 April 2008.  At the time of signature of the Agreement, the Council of Ministers decided that the procedures for its formal ratification would begin when the Council agreed unanimously that Serbia was cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).At the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June 2010, Ministers received a positive assessment from the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY regarding Serbia's ongoing cooperation with the Tribunal. On that basis, the Council decided, by consensus, to submit the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to their national parliaments for ratification. The Council also underlined that full cooperation with the ICTY remained an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.Preparations for the ratification by Ireland of the Agreement are under way and I expect that a motion asking Dáil Éireann to approve the terms of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia will be moved in the autumn.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	754	The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty has led to significant changes in the European Union's institutional arrangements. These include the creation of a full-time President of the European Council, the establishment of a new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the creation of a European External Action Service (EEAS). The EEAS is intended to support the work of the High Representative across the entire range of EU external relations.Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty states that development cooperation policy shall have as its primary objective the reduction and, in the longer term, the eradication of poverty. It further states that this primary objective must be respected in all other EU policies that are likely to affect development policy.Given the central role that the EEAS, under the responsibility of the High Representative, is to play in the EU's external relations, some Member States, including Ireland, were concerned to ensure that no aspect of development policy would be weakened in the process of integration into the EEAS.  Following the protracted and detailed discussions on the subject between the Commission, Council and Member States, I believe that arrangements have been agreed which can raise the profile of development policy and promote policy coherence across all areas of the Union's external relations.  This was a key objective of the Lisbon Treaty.The European External Action Service will play a central role in development policy and development programming, working in close collaboration with the Commission throughout the full aid programming, planning and implementation cycles. The EEAS and the Commission will both be responsible for specific elements of the programming cycle, with the Development Commissioner allocated the role of main decision maker. This will encourage a high level of coordination and cooperation between the High Representative, the External Action Service and the Development Commissioner in all stages.These new arrangements have the potential to mark a significant improvement in the coherence and consistency of the EU's external policies, including development policy in all its aspects. In line with the spirit and ambition of the Lisbon Treaty, I am confident that they will assist in the more effective integration of development into the EU's overall external relations and improve the effectiveness of both development policy and broader foreign policy, with a strong, central focus on poverty reduction.It is also important to note that the proposal by the High Representative, which was agreed to by Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council in April, is not set in stone. A review of the EEAS is scheduled for 2012.  It will be based clearly on the experience of the next two years, and on the views of Member States, including Ireland, on issues including the effectiveness of the Union's development programme.  The Government will continue to follow this important issue very closely.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 393 and 394 together.Deputies will be aware that Ireland, along with our EU partners, has been seriously concerned about human rights violations in Iran for some time. I have consistently raised these concerns at the highest level with the Iranian authorities, most recently during the course of my meeting with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin on 9 June. Among the issues I raised at that meeting were the current human rights situation in Iran, including the ongoing detention of the Baha'i community leaders and our concerns about the extensive use of the death penalty. I also expressed my serious concern that the Iranian authorities have effectively refused to receive EU demarches on human rights issues, and emphasised that we expect to be able to convey our position on human rights and other issues in Tehran.The overall human rights situation in Iran has continued to deteriorate over the course of the past year, since the disputed presidential election of June 2009. Measures taken by the Iranian authorities to repress dissent and to further marginalise minorities such as the Baha'i community include executions, arrests and actions against free speech, such as closing newspapers, blocking websites and arresting contributors to websites of Iranian human rights organisations, as well as detentions on charges such as espionage, propaganda and activities against the Islamic order. Worryingly, Iran's rate of executions has risen in the past year, and the Iranian authorities appear to be using the threat of the death penalty as a method of discouraging further dissent.Our Embassy in Tehran is actively engaged, in concert with our EU partners, in closely monitoring and reporting on human rights issues in Iran. High Representative Ashton also issued a strong statement on 12 June, the first anniversary of the 2009 Presidential election, condemning Iran's human rights abuses, including the increasing use of the death penalty, as well as reiterating concerns over the ongoing trial of the seven Baha'i community leaders.I have reported to the House on a number of occasions in relation to the growing oppression of the Baha'i minority, including the arrest and trial on very dubious charges of leading members of the faith. As indicated, I expressed my concerns on the treatment of the Baha'i community in Iran and the ongoing trial of its leaders at my meeting with Foreign Minister Mottaki on 9 June. There are some unconfirmed reports that the trial of the seven community leaders has now concluded, after three days of successive court hearings from 12-14 June. It is clear that the Iranian authorities are persecuting a minority for their religious beliefs, and indeed they appear to be actively trying to suppress a religious faith.In relation to the specific case of Dr. Kian Tajbakhsh, I refer the Deputy to the answer I gave on 27 April to his question on the matter.  Dr. Tajbakhsh was sentenced on 10 February to five years imprisonment for a variety of charges linked to the post-election disturbances in Iran. He has been released on bail since 13 March, and it remains to be seen whether he will in due course be permitted to leave the country. I discussed Dr. Tajbakhsh's case with Foreign Minister Mottaki at our meeting on 9 June and requested that he and his family be permitted to leave Iran.Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran and to express our concerns about the marked deterioration in respect for such rights at every suitable opportunity, both bilaterally and at EU and UN level.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	756	I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Priority PQs Nos. 27 and 30 of today.The current Irish passport system is one of the most secure in the world. The taxpayer has made significant investment in enhancing the security of our passports.  The passport has been designed to ensure that the technologies used are those strictly controlled and mandated by the relevant international body, ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) in Montreal.  Officers of the Passport Service meet regularly with other similar jurisdictions and ICAO to ensure that the Irish passport meets these international security demands and best practice.While the fake Irish passports used by those suspected of involvement in the Dubai assassination were of a type produced before the introduction of the current APS Passport in 2005, it must be emphasised that these passports conformed fully to the highest international standards in place at that time.  The passport was further enhanced in 2006 with the addition of a biometric chip, the Irish ePassport.As forgery techniques advance, through the availability of more sophisticated production equipment, it is essential that the security of the Irish passport is kept under constant review.  It is in this context I announced last week that I have requested the Passport Service to initiate an ongoing review of passport technology to ensure that the Irish passport continues to be a trusted and secure travel document.   This review will include consultations with the ICAO Secretariat.In regard to the issue of the alleged use of counterfeit Irish passports, on Sunday 27 June, U.S. federal agents arrested a number of people for allegedly carrying out long-term, "deep cover" assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.  The individuals were subsequently charged with conspiring to act as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation within the United States and in the case of some of the individuals additional charges related to money laundering.  The affidavit lodged by the F.B.I. alleges that one of the defendants had travelled to Moscow using a false Irish passport.Upon hearing of this allegation, I immediately asked the Passport Service to investigate the matter and to work in close cooperation with An Garda Síochána.  Investigations are currently underway.  They are at a very preliminary stage and therefore I am not in a position to provide more detail today.At this time, what we are confronted with is an allegation in a US Court that an individual had travelled from Rome to Moscow on a false Irish passport.  Our own investigating officers are working to establish the veracity of this allegation and to establish the nature of the evidence to substantiate this.  Accordingly, it is premature to reach any conclusions or make representations to other Governments at this time.I wish to see the current investigations concluded at the earliest opportunity.  However, I am conscious that there is a legal process underway in the United States.  I am sure Deputies would share with me the necessity not to comment or act in any way which might influence the outcome of these proceedings.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The Western Balkans was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 14 June which I attended.  This came shortly after a high level meeting on the Western Balkans which took place in Sarajevo on 2 June and was organised by Spanish EU Presidency.  The meeting in Sarajevo was attended by all EU and Western Balkans countries, including Serbia and Kosovo.  Ireland was represented at the meeting by Minister of State Mansergh.The Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg reaffirmed the EU's unequivocal commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries while noting that each country's progress towards the EU depends on its individual efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process.  The Council also welcomed the commitment of countries in the region to intensify the pace of reform in key areas and stressed the importance of addressing the challenges ahead.  The importance of strengthening regional cooperation was underlined and recent positive initiatives regarding reconciliation were welcomed.  The EU's support for the goal of the abolishment of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans was also recalled.Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans region.  The EU perspective for the countries in the region, agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping to build and maintain this stability.  The EU's Stabilisation and Association process provides the framework for cooperation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing countries in the region towards EU standards and principles.The high level meeting held in Sarajevo in 2 June took place in a positive, constructive and pragmatic atmosphere and served to build on positive developments we have seen in the region over the last six months.From an operational perspective, there are several actors with significant presences on the ground in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo.  The international military presences in both Kosovo and in Bosnia and Herzegovina are gradually downsizing in line with the improving security situation while the civilian peace operations continue to focus on building up local rule of law and police capacities, in particular supporting the fight against organised crime and corruption, in both countries.The UN peace presence in the Western Balkans is now restricted to the residual UN interim administration in Kosovo (UNMIK).  With the declaration of Kosovo's independence and the deployment in 2008 of the EU rule of law mission EULEX, UNMIK relinquished its executive role for one of support to minority communities, encouragement of reconciliation and facilitation of dialogue and regional cooperation.The key international presence in Kosovo is EULEX, the EU's largest civilian mission that aims to assist and advise Kosovo institutions in developing and professionalising across the rule of law area, specifically police, judicial and customs authorities.  While the initial mission mandate was for two years, it is foreseen that the mission will continue to further assist the Kosovo authorities with the development of their capacities to guarantee that all members of society in Kosovo benefit from the rule of law.  The April 2010 EU Foreign Affairs Council welcomed the mission's increased presence on the ground in the north of Kosovo and its intensified efforts in the fight against organised crime and corruption.The UN-mandated and NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) helps the local authorities and EULEX to maintain a safe and secure environment in Kosovo.  Deployed under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 1999, in June 2008 KFOR assumed new tasks of supporting the development of professional, democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo security structures.  Over time, KFOR has gradually adjusted its force posture to what it calls a deterrent presence: essentially a reduced number of troops progressively relying more on flexibility and intelligence.  At their meeting in June 2010, NATO Defence Ministers and Ministers from non-NATO KFOR contributing nations agreed that this gradual transformation of KFOR into a smaller and more mobile force is proceeding successfully.In Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the other hand, both main international peace operations are from the European Union: the military stabilisation Operation Althea and the police reform mission EUPM.  The EU Police Mission, established in 2003 to follow on from the UN's International Police Task Force, focuses on capacity-building and professionalising the local law enforcement authorities, in particular in relation to the fight against organised crime.  The April 2010 EU Foreign Affairs Council welcomed the refocusing of the mission's mandate on the support to the fight against organised crime and corruption.Under UN Security Council mandate the EU's military operation Althea was launched in December 2004 to succeed the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR).  Althea supports the efforts of the Bosnian authorities to maintain a safe and secure environment.  In January 2010, the EU underlined its readiness to maintain an executive military role to support these efforts beyond 2010, under a UN mandate, should the situation so require.  At the same time, Operation Althea will commence capacity-building and training of the armed forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	759	As the Deputy will be aware from previous statements in this House, most recently on 20 May, the Government has long been deeply concerned about the situation in Burma.  We remain very actively engaged at both the EU and international level in monitoring the situation in the country and in our efforts to support the Burmese people in their struggle for justice, democracy and development.The situation at present is particularly difficult and I regret that there is still very little of a positive nature, in terms of the situation and initiatives, on which I can report.  The Burmese authorities are pushing ahead with plans to hold elections later this year.  Despite a broad view that the terms of the discredited 2008 Constitution virtually precluded the possibility of credible elections, the international community felt it important to do all in its power to urge the regime to conduct elections, and an electoral process, in a way which would be free, fair, inclusive and transparent.  We also made clear the need for all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, to be released without delay and for a process of national dialogue and reconciliation, involving all opposition and ethnic groups, to be initiated in advance of the elections.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was particularly clear in articulating international expectations during his visit to the country last July.However, instead of being given her freedom, Aung San Suu Kyi's detention was extended for a period of 18 months in August last year, to ensure that she would not be in a position to contest the elections or to lead her party in them.  Few other political prisoners were released and no effort was made to initiate national dialogue.  Military offensives against a number of other ethnic groups continue, designed to crush their resistance in the lead-up to the elections.The electoral laws issued on 10 March by the Burmese authorities demonstrated unequivocally that there is no interest on their part in listening to what their own people or the international community have been saying in terms of the elections.  Instead of providing for an inclusive process which would permit opposition and ethnic groups to participate freely, the electoral laws demonstrated that the regime intends to control every aspect of the preparation of the elections, their outcome and the future government which will emerge from them.The most serious consequence of these laws are the restrictions placed on the registration of political parties and individuals, which have effectively forced Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD party, who have done much to promote justice, democracy and reconciliation in Burma, to disband as a political organisation.The Deputy will be aware that the Obama Administration took the decision to increase its engagement with the Burmese regime, with a view to determining if such a course might help to achieve the objective of dialogue and credible elections.  While US Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell has paid two visits to Burma in this context, the most recent in early May, and although he succeeded in meeting separately with Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her NLD party, he was unable to make any progress on the agenda of electoral inclusiveness, credibility and legitimacy.  The US is not optimistic that the regime will change its position between now and the time of the elections.  They will, however, continue to engage with the regime, while maintaining sanctions.The EU is pursuing a similar approach.  The European Council agreed last December that, while maintaining its sanctions policy, the EU should send an exploratory, official-level, mission to Burma to examine the possibilities for a more pro-active EU role there.  Given the range of negative developments in Burma, I called for a discussion on the situation in Burma and the EU's response to it to take place at the April Foreign Affairs Council. At that Council, we highlighted our very serious concerns regarding the current situation and urged that the proposed EU Mission be very carefully considered, planned and targeted.  While there are concerns in relation to organising this visit, it is important that we listen to the strong message from Aung San Suu Kyi supporting international engagement.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	760	Unfortunately, no part of the world is totally free from human rights abuses.  As has been stated on previous occasions, in response to similar Questions, it is not the policy of the Government to draw up a ‘league table' of countries deemed guilty of the most blatant human rights abuses.  The complexity and specificity of individual country situations could render such an exercise difficult and probably of little value. Ireland, both bilaterally and in association with the EU and other like-minded partners, makes frequent and numerous interventions with regard to human rights concerns in the countries which have the most serious human rights abuses.Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official channels and non-governmental/civil society organisations.Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.  At these UN bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries from all regions.  Ireland is fully associated with these statements.  The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries.The Universal Periodic Review mechanism is one example of how Ireland and the international community can bring pressure to bear on those responsible for human rights violations.  Ireland has engaged proactively with this UN Human Rights Council mechanism since its creation in March 2006.  At the eighth session of the UPR, which took place in Geneva, from 3-14 May 2010, Ireland made a number of interventions, raising issues such as gender based violence, the right to education, the death penalty, independence of the media, freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom of assembly, the role of National Human Rights Institutions and the protection of human rights defenders within the States under review.The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law.  In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.The risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak.  Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and this is a key concern for Ireland's development co-operation programme.  Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Support is also provided for legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses.  Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	761	It is not the policy of the Government to list countries most seriously affected by such issues as hunger, war, genocide or human rights abuses, which are issues that affect many countries in Africa and elsewhere, and I shall therefore not focus on individual countries.With regard to the issue of hunger and famine, it is estimated that more than a billion people today do not have enough food.  Ireland is responding to this challenge, working bilaterally in our programme countries with our EU partners and other donors, and at a global level through the UN agencies.  Since the publication of the report of the Hunger Task Force in September 2008, Ireland's focus on hunger reduction has become a cornerstone of Irish Aid's development programme.  In particular, efforts are concentrated on the three priority areas identified in the report, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition (especially maternal and infant); and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger.  Nowhere is this work more challenging than in countries affected by conflict where it is critically important to move quickly with large-scale emergency food assistance in order to save lives.With regard to security, UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa have a role in stabilising former and current conflict zones.  Members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in numerous UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa, including in the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and most recently in Chad.Situations which fully conform to an internationally accepted definition of genocide are thankfully extremely rare.  Nevertheless, there are a number of current situations in Africa which give rise to extreme concern.  The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide is mandated to alert the international community to the potential of genocide in a particular country or region, and to make recommendations on actions to prevent or halt genocide.Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland monitors closely the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations.Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, including, in the case of the latter, through the new Universal Periodic Review process whereby the human rights performance of each UN State is reviewed.Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe provides opportunities for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses.  Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.For example, together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law.  The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of famine, war, genocide and human rights abuses, African leadership and responsibility are crucial.  This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African States and the African Union to respond to these challenges.  Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to the challenges of poverty, hunger and famine, conflict, security and human rights abuses stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.

Both of these contracts are currently held by Irish companies with all technical and production facilities located in Ireland.However, in accordance with Irish law (which gives effect to Ireland's international obligations in these matters), these contracts are tendered periodically and are open to competition from suppliers in all EU/EEA countries as well as suppliers from countries that are parties to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).I appreciate that this is a competitive challenge to Irish companies.  However, under the same agreements, there is an equivalent entitlement for Irish companies to compete for a vast range of public sector contracts in all EU countries as well as in all GPA countries.  This is an opportunity that is in our national economic interests as an exporting economy to pursue. Details on how to access opportunities in international public sector markets can be found on my Department's website and the Deputy can be assured that my Department, including at embassies abroad, will be happy to assist Irish companies in pursuing procurement opportunities.In the case of smaller print jobs (for reports, stationery etc) my Departments makes use of  drawdown contracts that have been put in place by the Government Procurement Service of the Office of Public Works, and I understand that Irish companies have been awarded all such work.My Department's missions abroad have occasional small print requirements and it is more economically advantageous to source such requirements locally.

The group comprises representatives from Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympic Council of Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs.One of the issues that the group is looking at is Ireland's potential to attract international teams and athletes for training camps in the lead up to London 2012.  My Department has funded the development of a number of top quality facilities around the country designed to meeting the training needs of elite competitors in a variety of sports.  Among the projects which have been supported are the National Aquatic Centre, the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, sports facilities at the University of Limerick and University College Dublin (UCD) and Morton Stadium.A number of these sports facilities have produced brochures to market their facilities as pre-London training camps.  The National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA) is actively promoting the National Aquatic Centre as a training venue for Olympic and Paralympic teams in the lead up to the London Games.  I also attended the launch of UCD as a London 2012 pre-training camp venue in April.My Department is producing a CD which will contain the details of a number of Irish elite sports facilities which are suitable as pre-London training camps.  This CD will be promoted through the network of National Olympic/Paralympic Committees and the Irish Embassies abroad in the coming months.  The high-level coordination group will continue to meet on an ongoing basis over the next two years to maximise opportunities from the London 2012 Games.

This provision has been in force since 31 December 2005.The "2008 Report on Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 on Employment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service" contains the most recent official figures for the number of people with declared disabilities employed in State agencies that adhere to the definition of a public body set out in section 46 of the Act.   The figures are neither collected nor broken down on a regional or county basis.Vocational Education Committees (VECs) do not adhere to the definition of a public body as set out and so do not come under the remit of Part 5 of the Act.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	772	As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).All community development projects (CDPs) and local development companies (LDCs) that are currently in receipt of funding through the LCDP have signed up:to implement the new programme in the context of my Department's integration strategy; andto meet specified deadline dates (submission of workplan by 26 March 2010 and of integration plan by 30 June 2010).The position is that, unless a project has received provisional approval from my Department for an alternative LCDP integration model, groups were still required to submit their plans for full integration by 30 June.My Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with LDCs, but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'. Alternative models will, however, be required to meet a range of criteria, including a reduction in the number of structures, promoting the potential for integrated delivery of services to the public, supporting efficiencies and reducing the burden of company law compliance for CDPs. The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.In recent weeks, I have been able to respond positively to possible alternative models put forward by the Paul Partnership and Limerick City CDPs, and by HSE South and a number of CDPs in the Cork/Kerry area. While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am confident that a real possibility for agreement exists.Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs, including Northside Partnership, the National Community Development Forum and others, have also been under consideration. However, a model that does not entail significant change is unlikely to meet the specified criteria.The model proposed by the Forum, while having the potential for integrated service delivery, does not meet the objective of reduced structures, and, in fact, would constitute maintenance of the status quo with regard to those structures. In addition, it does not appear to have the potential to reduce the administrative and legal burdens currently required of CDP board members.   However, I can assure the Forum that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives, based on the specified criteria, and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some commentators, full integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area. As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under a CDP can continue to be delivered under the proposed new LCDP structure and by the same staff who currently do this work.  Of course, CDPs may opt out of the LCDP integration process and decide to go it alone. In such cases, my Department will be supportive in relation to the retention of any assets acquired with programme funding and may also be in a position to provide for some limited funding for a transition period, subject to certain conditions.A number of CDPs have raised concerns about the treatment of assets (particularly buildings) in a full integration situation, where all assets and net liabilities would usually transfer by agreement. However, I want to emphasise that other arrangements are possible — for example, the ownership of buildings need not transfer to an LDC.  This was also made clear in the context of the information event for CDPs and LDCs, held by Pobal on my Department's behalf, on 10 June last.May I take this opportunity to reassure all concerned that my focus remains firmly on ensuring that scarce resources are targeted at the most vulnerable communities through optimising our efforts and resources at the front-line.

There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted on my Department's behalf to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these Groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.The table below details: the indicative allocation to each Group under the Programme to date; the amount drawn down by each Group to date; the funding committed by each Group to be drawn down; and the balance yet to be committed.The Deputy will appreciate that it is imperative, particularly in the current economic climate, that the RDP maximises the funding available for the Programme on the ground, in order to ensure the improvement of the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy. With this in mind, I recently announced that the Groups are free to enter into commitments up to the value of €40m for 2011. In announcing this initial allocation for next year, I urged the Groups to focus their energies on supporting projects that will bring jobs and real and sustainable growth to communities across rural Ireland. Overall, I am confident that the availability of this initial €40m allocation for next year will allow the Groups to do this.Local Action GroupOverall Programme Allocation

Therefore, any employment matters are solely for the boards of those companies.I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to section 2(3) of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, which provides that:The Minister shall not be, or be deemed to be, an employer, within the meaning of the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts 1994 and 2001, by virtue of the provision of funding to a person or persons under any scheme.Against this background, the Deputy will appreciate that the matter referred to by him is not a matter for my Department.

The Executive further advised that as the person in question had not secured accommodation within the maximum rent limits, payment of rent supplement ceased.This decision was appealed to the Community Welfare Officer to the HSE Appeals Office. The HSE Appeals Office upheld this decision. The person concerned has further appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

During the past two years 7 additional staff were assigned to the office and a further 7 staff were assigned to fill vacancies that occurred in the office.The current processing times for claims in the office are 1.17 weeks for jobseeker's benefit and 8.44 weeks for jobseeker's allowance.  Last December the comparable figures were 1.31 and 9.19 weeks respectively.  The percentage of claims pending award has also fallen from 19% of the claimload at the end of December 2009 to 14% at the end of June 2010.A range of measures have been used to reduce the backlog of claims awaiting decision, including re-vamping the appointments system to get more appointments done and to get more claims decided at the appointment stage, the use of overtime including weekends and use of the regional support unit to assist in deciding claims.Overall the measures taken to reduce the waiting time are proving worthwhile, but during the period December 2009 to June 2010, industrial action taken by staff reduced the effectiveness of the measures.  Now that this action has ceased, it is expected that further improvements will be seen in the processing times.  The workflows in this office and customer service generally are being monitored closely by local management.

The methods of assessment of the liable relative's ability to pay are specified in detail in Regulations (S.I. 571 of 2006 and S.I. 142 of 2007). In every case where a one parent family payment is awarded, the maintenance recovery unit of the Department seeks to trace the other parent, referred to as the liable relative, in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of one parent family payment.The financial and new dependency situation of each liable relative is assessed in detail. The assessment is based on the net weekly income (i.e. income from all sources less income tax and PRSI) with deductions for a personal allowance in respect of personal needs, a child dependant allowance in respect of each child living with the liable relative, and an allowance may also be granted in respect of the liable relative's accommodation costs. Any maintenance currently being paid to the one parent family recipient is also taken into account.All liable relatives assessed with maintenance liability are notified by the Department and they are issued with a determination order setting out the amount of contribution assessed. The amount assessed can be reviewed where new information comes to light about the financial or household circumstances of the liable relative. Decisions on the amounts assessed can be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.A liable relative is given the option to commence making payments to the recipient of the one parent family payment (OFP) or directly to the Department. When payments are made directly to the recipient there may be a reduction in the rate of OFP payment by the Department. However the lone parent would still be better off as a result of the MRU activity.

Persons who are in receipt of carer's allowance also receive the annual respite care grant, the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  In the majority of cases, persons who are being cared for will be in receipt of a payment in their own right (for example a State pension or disability allowance) and will be entitled to have a free travel pass.  This includes anyone aged over 16 who qualifies for disability allowance.For a child requiring full-time care who is under age 16, a domiciliary care allowance of €309.50 per month may be paid to the parent or guardian.  This payment is not means tested and is to provide for the additional costs involved in providing care and supervision that is substantially more than that normally needed by a child of the same age.  This may include additional travel costs.A child who is attending school may be eligible for assistance under the Department of Education and Skills school transport scheme.I have no plans at present to review the qualifying criteria for the free travel scheme or to provide free travel passes for children other than those who are in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department.

While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work of the next few years.  The measures referred to will encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.In light of increased demand for training and education, the Government is now providing, through FÁS, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed this year.  This is a substantial increase on the approximate 66,000 places provided last year. There is a wide range of education and training opportunities available through my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and FÁS to jobseekers to support them in strengthening their qualifications and skills base and thereby maximising their chances of meeting the requirements of the modern labour market and gaining employment.The measures referred to represent one element of ongoing reforms and enhancement of the national employment action plan and will work in tandem with changes in ministerial responsibility and other developments such as customer profiling and restructuring of agencies to deliver a better outcome for users of services and for the taxpayerIt may also be noted that the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides for a weekly supplement to meet specific needs such as rent and/or mortgage interest supplement, diet supplement, heating supplement, or a once-off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs a person may have which they could not reasonably be expected to meet from their own resources, such as support to those requiring assistance with a rent deposit.  One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation.

Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that the person concerned applied for rent supplement on 29 May 2010.

This means that people reaching pension age after the credits are introduced will have credits rather than disregards applied to their records to cover periods of care since 1994 (up to a maximum of 20 years).Upon introduction of the total contributions approach in 2020, the maximum number of credits applicable for pension purposes will be 520 (i.e. 10 years). It is intended that a standard approach will apply to the various categories of people who receive credited contributions, including jobseekers and people with disabilities.An implementation group chaired by my Department has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the necessary changes into operation.

The receipt of each appeal is acknowledged and appellants are kept informed of the progress of their appeals. However, given the volume of appeals, it is not possible to estimate the length of time before a case is determined.During 2009, the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks. However, if allowance is made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time falls to 15.8 weeks. This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008.The longest period for which a person is currently awaiting resolution of an appeal is seven years, but this case has been delayed pending the outcome of related matters currently before the High Court. The majority of cases on hands were received since mid-2009 and during 2010.There has been a significant growth in the number of appeals over the past couple of years with an expected intake of some 35,000 in 2010 compared with around 15,000 per annum up to and including 2007 and, while this growth is clearly impacting on processing times, it must also be remembered that such processing times cover all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases, further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant. Delays can also occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings. In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellants or their representatives.A number of initiatives are currently underway designed to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows. In that regard:2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,A number of additional staff are being assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office is underway and a number of improvements have already been implemented, andSignificant enhancements are being made to the office's IT and phone systems.Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that additional staff are required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed. It has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis. To facilitate this initiative, the Social Welfare Bill, has commenced second stage in Seanad Eireann, includes an amendment to allow these retired officers to decide appeal cases. The Chief Appeals Officer is monitoring the situation closely.

There has been an increase of a further 58.5% in the number of appeals received to the end of June 2010.  These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Despite the social welfare changes made in the last Budget, the expenditure of my Department will still increase in 2010.  Nearly €21 billion will be spent on social welfare this year or €500 million more than in 2009.The October 2008 budget provided for increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates at a time when inflation for 2009 was expected to be 2.5%.  Prices declined by an average of 4.5% in 2009. This trend continued in January when prices declined by 1.1%.  While there have been some increases in inflation in recent months, consumer prices are back at March 2007 levels.  However, the lowest weekly rate of payment for those aged between 25 and 66 is currently over €10 higher than in 2007.I note that the Poor Can't Pay coalition, in a recent statement, is concerned about the impact of any further welfare changes.  Social welfare changes for 2011 will be considered later this year in the context of next year's budget preparations, having regard both to needs and to the resources available to meet those needs.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  The income limits for 2010 are €563.60 for a couple with one child and €410.10 for a lone parent with one child.  The limit is increased by €29.80 for each additional child.The rationale for the different income limits for lone parents and couples is to take account of the fact that there is an extra adult in the couple household who has to be provided for and the income limit for couples reflects this.

Income includes cash income, private pensions, foreign pensions, the value of any property and the value of any investments, monies held in financial institutions and capital which the claimant may have.  Where a social security payment is being received from a paying authority in another jurisdiction, it is the policy of the scheme area to seek official documentary evidence from the client of the specific amount being paid by that authority.  Accordingly, the scheme area does not normally accept evidence of a social security payment by way of entries on bank statements.There is an onus on the Social Welfare Local Officer to request any documentation necessary to clarify the position in regard to any aspect of a client's means in order to assess a claim for State pension (non-contributory).  It is also incumbent on that officer to investigate the current position with regard to information which may have been submitted earlier in the application process.  If a particular bank account is no longer in operation, then the onus is on the client to provide documentary evidence of that fact from the relevant bank.

In the short space of time available for answer, it has not been possible to establish the extent to which the records still exist and, if so, to locate them.  However, the Department will seek to locate relevant records and will correspond directly with the Deputy in this regard in the near future.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	827	Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is focused firmly on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force. Government approval was secured in the context of Budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 31 May 2010 was 9,809 comprising 7,996 Army, 795 Air Corps and 1,018 Naval Service personnel. Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 recruits to the Naval Service and the recruitment process is currently underway.  In addition, the military authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.The question of a cadet class for the Permanent Defence Force in 2010 is being considered in the context of the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Defence Forces on foot of the Government approval, in the context of Budget 2010, to maintain a complement of 10,000 all ranks Permanent Defence Force personnel.  I will consider the matter in the context of the results of this review.  I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.

A separate statutory authority would give rise to additional costs in terms of staff and accommodation, which cannot be justified in the current economic climate.I have recently met with the Kildare Archaeological Society and their concerns have been noted.  In addition, officials from the Department are continuing to meet interest groups concerning the management of the Curragh.  I consider the input from local groups to be very important  in the context of seeking to ensure best practice in the management of the Curragh lands into the future.

There are an estimated 150 monuments within the overall Curragh complex some of which are within the area of the Curragh under the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  In addition there are a number of other monuments, such as those in Donnelly's Hollow and within the Curragh Camp, which are under the control of the Department of Defence or Military Authorities.A map showing the location of the recorded monuments at  the Curragh camp and plains is available from the National Monuments Service of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  There is one graveyard on the Curragh, which is under the control of the Department of Defence.  Within that graveyard there are 106 graves that are under the administration of the Commonwealth War Grave Commission. By agreement the Department provides for the maintenance of the grounds while the Office of Public Works provides for the upkeep of the headstones.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €130 million in the county during the period of the Programme.The Lettermore supply is part of the Costello Regional Water Supply Scheme which is included in the Programme amongst the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010-2012.  The Council is currently advancing the detailed planning of the Costello scheme.  In advance of these major works, my Department approved funding of €432,000 last March to allow Galway County Council to upgrade the Lettermore water treatment plant to improve quality of supply.  I understand that Galway County Council has signed the contract to upgrade   the Lettermore plant and that work is expected to commence later this year.  Further information on progress with this contract may be had from the Council.

My Department is currently finalising draft new Habitats Regulations which will be published shortly for public consultation.  These Regulations will include provisions to prohibit the sale and distribution of non-native plants and animals that are known to pose a threat to native species and habitats.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	841	I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 and 493 together.The European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 — 2008, which transposed Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings into Irish law, require a Building Energy Rating (BER) certificate to be obtained prior to a building being offered for sale or letting out or prior to a newly commissioned building being occupied for the first time.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), as the designated issuing authority under the regulations, is responsible for the day to day administration of the BER scheme.  The assessment of buildings must be carried out by independent BER assessors who are registered with SEAI.The primary purpose of the BER certificate and advisory report is to enable prospective purchasers or tenants to take a building's energy performance into account when deciding on whether to avail of a building offered for sale or rent.  In line with other Member States, no official fee for BER certificates has been set in order to encourage a cost competitive market for BER assessment services.Any person seeking to become a BER Assessor for Dwellings is first required to have an appropriate construction related qualification of at least Level 6 (Advanced Certificate/Higher Certificate) or equivalent.  This enables the candidate to undergo a training course on the BER certification of dwellings with one of the approved training providers listed on the SEAI's website.  Training participants must achieve a score of 70% of the available marks at the end of course examination in order to be certified as a fully trained and qualified assessor.A certified assessor may apply to register with SEAI as a BER Assessor for Dwellings, subject to payment of the appropriate registration fee.  BER Assessors are required to renew their registration annually; this process involves a further competency test in order to ensure that their BER assessment skills are maintained to a high standard.

This exercise includes the re-classification of many existing SPA sites, including Dungarvan Harbour and Tramore Back Strand, which were first designated some sixteen years ago. A judgement delivered by the European Court of Justice against Ireland in December 2007 found that Ireland's classification of its SPAs had been inadequate in some respects and this has necessitated the re-classification of many of the older sites.The proposal to update the designation of Dungarvan Harbour and Tramore Back Strand Special Protection Areas (SPAs) was advertised on 26 May 2010. Appeals by affected landowners or land users may be made up to 26 August. The re-designation process will be concluded, following consideration of any appeals submitted, with the making of new Statutory Instruments for both sites.

The report found that 93% of the 131 bathing areas nationwide complied with EU mandatory standards.In relation to the 6 designated beaches in the Waterford area the report found that:3 beaches complied with the higher EU guide standard  (Bonmahon, Clonea and Tramore);2 beaches complied with the mandatory EU bathing water quality standard  (Ardmore and Counsellors' Strand, Dunmore East);1 beach failed to comply with the mandatory EU bathing water quality standard (Dunmore Strand, Dunmore).My Department's recently published Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 provides for a Waterford Grouped Towns and Villages Sewerage Scheme, which includes Dunmore East, and which is due to start construction within the period covered by the Investment Programme.  Implementation of this measure should assist in improving the water quality at the bathing site in Dunmore East.

The review will consider what measures may be required to ensure a consistent approach to these issues across all planning authorities, and to improve the delivery of planning services generally.To assist the review, my Department wrote to the following six planning authorities — Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils, and Cork and Dublin City Councils — on 23 June, asking them to examine a range of submissions made to me by stakeholder groups and individuals covering different planning issues and to provide a detailed response to the issues raised by 16 July.  I have also included Donegal County Council as part of this review on the basis of previously having requested and received a comprehensive report from the Council on a range of planning matters highlighted to my Department. These planning authorities represent a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas as well as both large and small authorities.  My Department will be establishing a panel of experts to undertake these reviews. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of the review at this stage.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €38 million in the county during the period of the Programme.  While the Corofin Sewerage Scheme is included in the Programme amongst the list of contracts in the county at construction in the period 2010 to 2012, it was not possible to include the Ballyvaughan and Doolin Sewerage Schemes amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion.The new Programme prioritises projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government's policy document Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time.

The Programme provides for the commencement of a number of contracts in the period 2010-2012 to improve the water supply infrastructure in the county with a total value of some €34 million.Of those contracts, the Arigna, Boyle/Ardcarne (Phase 2), Roscommon Central and South Roscommon Regional Water Supply Schemes are being advanced as a single project by Roscommon County Council.  Under this project, the Council will upgrade the networks under the Arigna and Boyle/Ardcarne Schemes and provide four new water treatment plants, with the network upgrades to be procured under a single contract and the four treatment plants to be procured under a single Design Build Operate contract.I understand that work is nearing completion on the networks contract for the South Roscommon Regional Water Supply Scheme.  My Department awaits the submission of Roscommon County Council's revised contract documents for the other elements of the project.

In the case of land purchase, this grant is limited to 20% of the cost involved.  The actual purchase of a site and any related negotiations and meetings are a matter for the local authority concerned.In 2004, Wexford County Council outlined their intention to provide for a Civic Amenity site in Gorey, in line with the Waste Capital Grants Scheme under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Over the subsequent years, further correspondence from the Council indicated substantial changes in their proposals and estimated costings. As final approvals under the scheme were completed in 2008, Wexford County Council reapplied to my Department under a new Waste Recycling Capital Grants Scheme, which was launched in 2008. A final revision of the project cost was received from Wexford County Council in December 2009 and a site visit to assess the project was carried out by my Department on 31 May 2010.  A decision on the application will issue to Wexford County Council as soon as possible.

My Department is currently examining the Contract Documents for the scheme submitted by Cork County Council.  Once the Contract Documents are approved, the Council can begin the process of preparing tender documents and in due course advertising for tenders for the work.The Government's water pricing policy in relation to the provision of water services infrastructure provides that the Exchequer funding is only available for the provision of services to the domestic sector while local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services infrastructure from the non-domestic sector.  Accordingly, the cost of the Bandon Sewerage Scheme will be met in part by my Department and in part by Cork County Council.  Generally, the costs arising for the authority are financed from borrowing which is recouped from charges on the non-domestic sector, development levies or once-off capital contributions (where capacity is reserved for or assigned to particular industries).  In the light of this, it will be a matter for the Council to consider how the Council's contribution towards the cost of the scheme will be met.

In February 2010, I announced the approval of funding for some 75 voluntary and co-operative housing projects at various locations around the country.My Department's involvement with the CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the scheme, including the certification that projects comply with its terms and conditions, the processing of applications and the payment of capital grants in respect of approved housing projects, are the responsibility of the local authority.In terms of overall CAS allocations, provisional allocations issued in January 2010 and the position in respect of each of the individual schemes to be advanced was discussed with the respective local authorities at Housing action Plan meetings in February and March 2010. Final allocations issued on 8 April 2010 and the allocations letters confirmed details of the new CAS projects approved for advancement in the 2010/2011 work programme.The inclusion of a project in the allocations listing did not automatically confer approval of each project, as all projects have to be processed in compliance with the relevant requirements and guidelines for the management of CAS schemes, including compliance with capital appraisal guidelines. Due to localised industrial action, there was a delay in my Department in the first quarter of 2010 in issuing correspondence to certain local authorities on matters requiring further follow up in regard to new CAS projects. Letters have since issued to all the authorities affected, other than in respect of eight new projects in the South East, and letters will now issue on these following the suspension of industrial action by the union concerned at the end of June.

There has been subsequent correspondence with the Commission and bilateral meetings have been held to clarify aspects of Ireland's response.The latest letter issued to the Commission on 16 February 2010 and included updates on the remaining waste sites, on which concerns still exist.Significant efforts have been made since 2005 to address the issues highlighted in the court judgement, particularly in how we manage waste, and also in the area of enforcement. The progress made has been acknowledged by the Commission. The outstanding requirements relate to historical waste issues and I am determined that these will be resolved as soon as possible.The closure of this case is ultimately a matter for the Commission. However, I am satisfied that the progress we have made has ensured that a robust framework for regulation and enforcement of waste activities is now in place.

In October 2009, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) found that Ireland failed to make adequate legislation for dealing with domestic wastewater from septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. Ireland's defence in the proceedings sought recognition for a range of monitoring and inspection powers under the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990, the Building Control Acts 1990-2007, the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 and the Water Services Act 2007. However, the ECJ found that the provisions cited only partially implement procedures to ensure the objectives of the Waste Directive. In order to comply with the ECJ ruling, legislation is, therefore, required to give effect to a new inspection and monitoring system for septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems.On the publication of the Joint Oireachtas Committee's report, I wrote to the Chairman to note that its recommendations were both timely and welcome and to assure the Committee that its report was being carefully considered. I expect that the issues raised in it will be addressed comprehensively in the proposals that I will be bringing forward to give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government and to ensure compliance with the Court ruling. My Department is considering how this monitoring and inspection system should operate and has been consulting extensively with the EPA, the local authorities and other key stakeholders on the matter. I intend to undertake consultations with wider stakeholders, and to bring proposals to Government to address these matters later this year.

The timing of the commencement of contracts within that period is a matter for the Water Services Authorities subject to the need for my Department's approval at key stages in the progression of projects through planning and on to construction.  Details on the progression of individual contracts can be obtained from the local authorities involved.The length of time to progress a scheme from initial design to completion varies with the scale and complexity of the scheme and the number of contracts involved, and is particularly dependent on the number and type of statutory processes required at the planning stage.  My Department has made every effort over the years to advance projects as expeditiously as possible, and in a manner consistent with meeting its responsibilities in relation to management of Exchequer funds.  This has included reviews of administrative procedures and improvements to project management systems.  Once the Preliminary Report has been approved for schemes where the procurement/construction stage budget is less than €5 million, contracts within the scheme may proceed up to and including the seeking of tenders without the need for further Departmental approval, subject to the cost remaining within approved budgets.

Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the locality which includes the areas referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the areas were excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ieIt continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.)The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

There is no corresponding provision in Irish national legislation and therefore the Court's ruling has no implications for Ireland.Under the provisions of the European Union regulatory framework for electronic communications, Eircom is subject to an obligation not to unreasonably bundle its services.  This general obligation, which is imposed by ComReg under Regulation 14 of the Universal Service and Users' Rights Regulations 2003, sets out that where Eircom offers a number of services within a bundle, it shall ensure that end-users are able to purchase an individual service included in any such bundle without being required by contractual or non-contractual means to purchase the entire bundle of services and that tariffs for the individual services comprising any such bundle comply with the principle that end-users should not be required to pay for services or facilities which are not necessary for the service requested.This obligation not to unreasonably bundle is not imposed on any undertaking other than Eircom, as Eircom is the only undertaking with significant market power (SMP) in a retail market.  Customers may purchase an Eircom bundle of services or a customer may purchase Eircom's calls separate from broadband.  Where a customer obtains either calls or broadband from Eircom it is necessary for the customer to pay for line rental since this is how these services are delivered.ComReg monitors compliance by Eircom with its obligation not to unreasonably bundle and considers that its regulation of bundles in Ireland is consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in case C-522/08 Telekommunikaja Polska.

I understand from ComReg that92% of all issues logged with its consumer care team were closed within 10 days or less in 2009.The first point of contact for any consumer complaint is the service provider.  ComReg requires each service provider to publish guidelines on handling consumer complaints. This approach is consistent with a provision in (EU) Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services which requires EU member states to make available an inexpensive dispute resolution procedure to decide on unresolved disputes.I am satisfied the procedures adopted by ComReg are consistent with the related obligation addressed to it in  the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended, and the European Communities (Electronic Communications) (Universal Service and Users' Rights) Regulations 2003 implementing (EU) Directive 2002/22/EC.

An associated programme objective is to assess measures required for supplier and product qualification to minimise the risk of adverse outcomes at small-scale and micro-generation installations, hence promoting the robust growth of a supply base.It is recognised that the equipment used for microgeneration needs to be safe and reliable and should perform to the specified standards. Installation quality may also impact performance and safety, and therefore there is a need for standards for microgeneration installations and for installer training. All pilot installations in SEAI's microgeneration pilot programme are subject to a performance monitoring period of 18 months. The pilot programme is expected to run until mid 2011.In conjunction with the pilot trials, the market potential of microgeneration and the possible supports that would be needed to achieve that potential are being assessed by my Department in conjunction with SEAI and ESB.ESB Customer Supply is the only electricity supply company currently offering domestic consumers a microgeneration feed-in tariff under certain terms and conditions.  This tariff is offered on a commercial basis and it is open to the other supply companies to enter this market.I consider that the introduction of a robust framework for the development of a vibrant microgeneration sector is a key component of building societal acceptance of energy infrastructure and ownership of the national renewable energy targets.I am committed to developing a comprehensive microgeneration framework in the near term.

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland operated a limited pilot phase of the scheme in operation in 2008, but this was restricted to a few small areas, not including Cork.  Based on the information provided by the Deputy, it would seem that the works were carried out long before the scheme came into operation.  The rules of the scheme do not provide for the payment of a grant for work carried out prior to application, as the scheme is designed to stimulate and incentivise investment as distinct from rewarding past investment.

On Thursday 24th June, it was drawn to EirGrid and the Inspector's notice that there was an error in the newspaper public notice and site notice relating to pylon height ranges for a section of the project.  It is the case that full details of the correct heights of the towers concerned were fully described in the Environmental Impact Statement and in the accompanying planning drawings which were submitted to An Bord Pleanála.Following consultation with its legal advisers EirGrid was advised that under the applicable legislation, there is no mechanism to correct the error within the context of the application. EirGrid therefore notified An Bord Pleanála on Tuesday 29th June, of the withdrawal of its application for the Meath-Tyrone 400 kV Interconnection Development.The Meath — Tyrone interconnection project is of significant strategic importance from an all-island electricity market perspective, and from the perspectives, both North and South, of security of supply, competitiveness, economic growth and renewable electricity integration.  I have already made clear my disappointment that EirGrid has had to withdraw its planning consent application for this important development. EirGrid is undertaking a full review of the circumstances which led to the error in the public notice and I have asked to be fully informed of the findings of this review.While I have no operational role in respect of transmission development or planning, I fully expect EirGrid to work assiduously and quickly to prepare a new planning consent application, with a view to avoiding any further delays in progressing this important project. EirGrid has indicated that it will submit a new application as quickly as possible over the coming months.It is estimated that the total costs incurred by EirGrid on this project since 2006 are approximately €8 million.  These costs include work on key project milestones such as project definition, environmental studies, surveys, consultation, route section, technical design, reports, analysis, production of an Environmental Impact Statement and the submission of an application for planning consent.  EirGrid advises that most of this work remains valid and applicable to any new planning consent application and that the new application will largely reflect the original application.

If the Deputy has specific issues of concern which he wishes to convey to me I will arrange to have them forwarded to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for direct reply.   The scheme, which is administered by the SEAI commenced in March 2009 and provides grant assistance to homeowners for retrofit energy efficiency measures such as attic and wall insulation, very high efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.Homeowners can apply online and receive speedy same day grant approval once key eligibility criteria are met.  All payment is made by Electronic Funds Transfer and all notifications are by email (for online applicants) with the exception of Declarations of Work which requires the signatures of both homeowner and contractor to draw down approved funds.There is a parallel postal system for homeowners without access to the online system.  The commitment that the SEAI gives is that postal applications will be processed within 21 days.  I am advised by SEAI that in practice the typical turnaround for such applications is one week.  The average turnaround time for all requests for payment is four to five weeks.  Since launch last year, the scheme has dealt with over 72,000 applications and processed payments worth €36m relating to the installation of 78,000 measures in over 41,000 homes.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	912	The live export trade complements the processed beef trade and is an important component of our meat and livestock industry.  Overall live exports in 2009 increased by 94% on 2008 levels. In the same period, exports to the UK increased by 159%, with those to Great Britain increasing by 440%, and those to other destinations by 74%.  Up to the end of week 25 of 2010, live exports were 49% ahead of the levels achieved during the same period in 2009, reflecting exceptionally strong demand for all classes of cattle in our main markets.  Again exports to Great Britain grew significantly above those to other destinations, increasing by some 118%, while those to Northern Ireland increased by 78% and those to all other destinations by 40%.  The weakening value of the euro against sterling offers opportunities to Irish beef exporters and there are indications that the live trade to Britain will increase in the short term as domestic demand there is expected to outstrip supply.  Bord Bia continues to work closely with the industry in monitoring and developing emerging opportunities for Irish livestock in the United Kingdom, the Continent and international markets.  Its activities include ongoing contact with leading retailers in Britain to establish their interest in cattle born in Ireland and finished in Britain.

The new bill will consolidate a wide range of existing legislation as well as repealing other legislation including the 1911 Protection of Animals Act.  The bill will also update much of the existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly. Its consolidation into a single statute will provide considerably more convenience to all those who deal with or have an interest in animal health and welfare matters.  I intend to submit the proposed heads of this bill to the Government at an early date.

It was therefore open to farmers without Natura or Commonage land to make an application without incurring the cost of employing a planner.  In cases where farmers did engage a planner, the terms of the contract for the provision of the planning service, including fees, was a matter for the two parties concerned and my Department has no involvement.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	918	The disposal of fallen animals is subject to Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002. Under this Regulation, animals which die on-farm must generally be disposed of through approved intermediate plants (knackeries) and rendering plants.  While my Department's contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme in general ceased with effect from 14th April 2009, I have continued to provide financial support for the collection of certain fallen animals, in particular bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national TSE surveillance programme.  With the ending of the Fallen Animals Scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme became a matter for negotiation between individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.My Department is continuing, within the boundaries of legal requirements, to make every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction in the costs associated with the disposal of fallen animals.  This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy purposes.  Approval conditions have been drawn up to facilitate the collection of fallen animals direct from farms by approved rendering plants, including arrangements to provide for TSE testing of these animals where required.  Discussions are also continuing between my Department and farmer and hunt representatives, to consider the feasibility of extending the network of plants authorised to act as knackeries.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	919	An application under the Single Payment Scheme /Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 24 April 2009.  This application was selected for a ground eligibility and cross compliance inspection.  During the course of the ground eligibility inspection a discrepancy was discovered with parcel number D23102066.  The claimed area for Single payment of 29.7ha was reduced to 29.33.  When tolerance is added this area was increased to 29.38 ha.  As the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held penalties will be applied per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  In this case the number entitlements held by the person named is 29.7.  As the difference between the area declared and the area found is not more than 3% and under 2ha, the area put forward for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 29.38ha.  For the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, the area declared of 29.7ha was reduced to 25.97ha as deductions were made on parcel D23102066 as REPS 3 Habitats are not eligible for DAS.As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found.  This left a shortfall of 3.73 ha which resulted in 14.36% of an over claim.  I have forwarded this file to the relevant section for review and the person named will be duly notified of the outcome and of his right to seek a review of this decision with 21 days.  The person named will also have the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.  As regards REPS, my Department is still waiting for documentation which was requested from the person named after an inspection in August 2009.  When that information is received, he will be notified of the outcome of the inspection.

Subsequent applications relating to the same set of entitlements were received for the 2008 and 2009 scheme years.  As the required testamentary information and documentation has not been supplied in support of the claim of the person named, it has not been possible to complete the requested transfer.  To allow my Department to proceed with the transfer to the person named, the solicitor administering the estate should provide an account of the current legal status of the estate.  If Letters of Administration have been extracted, the solicitor should supply a completed Transfer of Entitlements application form that has been signed by the person appointed as administrator.  If the estate is not extracting Letters of Administration, the solicitor should provide a list of persons who are beneficiaries of the estate and such beneficiaries may sign waivers in favour of the person named.  While such a list has been requested, and three waivers have been received, no comprehensive list of beneficiaries has been provided.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	925	Following on from discussions with the farming organisations in the context of the charter of rights for farmers in 2005, Ireland adopted a weighting system within the cross-compliance inspection regime whereby due account was taken of infringements of the cross-compliance requirements which were, on their own, inadvertent and minor in nature, and were capable of occurring in practical farming situations.  In such circumstances a certain level of tolerance was applied while, at the same time, the farmer was notified of the infringement.  Following a Commission review in 2007 on the operation of cross compliance, some legislative changes have been made which set rules for the non-imposition of sanctions for minor breaches of the cross compliance.Under the new regime, where a tolerance is initially applied, the farmer must be told of the non-compliance.  If the non-compliance is not immediately remedied, it must be remedied within a certain period of time, otherwise a penalty of a minimum 1% will apply and the normal rules of repetition will apply.  Checks must be carried out to ascertain whether or not the non-compliance has been remedied.  These checks can be of an administrative or other nature.  Council and Commission Regulations are now in place implementing the new arrangements with effect from 1 January 2008.

Together with ongoing commitments in REPS, this means that all EU funding for agri-environment payments up to the end of 2013 is now fully committed.  Any further support for agri-environment schemes in that period will, therefore, have to be funded entirely by the Exchequer and this is a matter which will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates process.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	929	I am aware that there has been an increase in the incidence of Brucellosis in certain parts of Northern Ireland, particularly Co Armagh, since the beginning of 2010.  However, based on available figures, the number of outbreaks in the province as a whole in the period January to April has fallen from 83 in 2008 to 36 in 2009 and again to 25 this year.  Notwithstanding the improvement in the overall situation, DARD has introduced additional testing in the Armagh area and they believe that the situation is now under control.  There are on-going contacts between officials from my Department and their counterparts in the Department Agriculture, Rural Development (DARD) in Northern Ireland in connection with the brucellosis situation there.  My Department's DVOs situated in border areas have been requested to carry out a risk assessment of the situation and to draw up plans for additional testing measures if they are required.  As Monaghan is geographically most at risk, a comprehensive plan has been put in place involving some additional testing in selected areas and in selected high risk herds in that county.  Other border county DVOs are also planning additional testing.Imports of eligible animals from Northern Ireland are both pre-movement tested before leaving NI and post-movement tested for brucellosis on arrival in the South.  Any further controls on imports from Northern Ireland would be contrary to EU legislation on trade in live animals.  Nevertheless, my officials will continue to monitor the brucellosis levels in Northern Ireland and will keep in close contact both at local and central level with their colleagues in Northern Ireland.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	939	Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme may be made only in respect of eligible land. Applicants under the Schemes are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them and details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded onto the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), my Department's computer-based land parcel tracking system. As LPIS underpins all the direct payments, it is crucial that it accurately reflects the true position on the ground.It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways, etc. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc. In the vast majority of cases, applicants make sufficient deductions for the ineligible features. However, where over-claims are detected and confirmed, the appropriate sanctions, as defined in the governing EU Regulations, must be applied. Indeed, from the point of view of the integrity of the entire SPS/DAS processing system within my Department and mindful of the combined value of payments under these Schemes — in excess of €1.8 billion annually (including REPS) — it is crucial that LPIS accurately reflect the position on the ground and, furthermore, that any breach of the governing rules are dealt with appropriately.As mentioned, the vast majority of applicants under both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme traditionally make sufficient allowances for ineligible areas and, consequently, do not suffer the consequences of over-claims. To date, since the advent of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005, the monetary value of over-claims under both SPS and DAS is some €4.6 million, which represents 0.06% of the €7.7 billion paid under both schemes during the period in question.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	940	As the Deputy is aware, the EU Court of Auditors raised concerns about the procedures for the designation of intermediate Disadvantaged Areas (also known as Less Favoured Areas) in the European Union. The concerns related to the number and variety of criteria used to designate such areas — Member States have used more than one hundred criteria — and the lack of transparency.The EU Commission has made a number of attempts to address these criticisms.  During 2004/2005, the Commission proposed these areas be designated using criteria based on area classification, reflecting poor soil qualities and climate conditions (e.g. average cereal yields, stocking density, percentage of permanent grassland, etc.) but this approach was rejected by the Council of Ministers.In 2007, the Commission commenced working with its Joint Research Centre (JRC) to establish a common soil and climate criteria that would support the delineation of Disadvantaged Areas. The intention was that a Commission proposal would be submitted to the Council in early 2009 for adoption by the Council of Ministers by the end of 2009. However, this was also abandoned by the Commission, in favour of the current approach, using biophysical criteria such as soil and climatic criteria to designate areas of natural handicap.Currently there are three categories of Disadvantaged Areas in the EU viz: Mountain Areas — none in Ireland but covers 16% of land area across the EU; Intermediate Less Favoured Areas — over 99% of Ireland's Least Favoured Areas (LFAs); Areas of Specific Handicap — 0.4% of Ireland's LFAs (Coastal Regions).  The areas, which are subject to the current review, consist of almost all of the Disadvantaged Area in Ireland.The Disadvantaged Areas, which, according to the Commission's suggestion, are to be re-titled as Areas of Natural Handicap, would be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria, based on the following: Climate, including Low Temperature and Heat Stress; Soil, including Drainage, Texture and Stoniness, Rooting Depth and Chemical Properties; Soil and Climate, including Soil Moisture Balance and Soil Moisture Deficit; Terrain, including Slope.The Commission have asked each Member States to use the suggested biophysical criteria that is relevant to farming in its territory to delineate, on a preliminary basis, the areas identifies as Areas of Natural Handicap. Bi-lateral meetings between the Member States, the Commission and their experts in the Joint Research Centre (JRC) have taken place; at these meetings (and in correspondence) officials of my Department, supported by research data provided by Teagasc, have indicated that the rainfall issue is the most important issue for Ireland; we have pointed out that the current EU Drainage criteria does not properly address the issue. We have pointed out that given that 90% of the country is grassland, with high rainfall and poor evaporation, trafficability on farmland is a huge problem. Areas with the highest annual levels of rainfall tend to have the lowest animal stocking densities, with a limitation on the farming enterprises that can be pursued.Following submission by my Department of the results of the required simulation exercises, further discussions took place with Commission and JRC representatives, following which my officials undertook to submit further supporting refined and detailed data. It is expected that this further data will be submitted shortly, following which there will then be further bi-lateral contact. It is my firm intention that everything will continue to be done to persuade the Commission and their JRC colleagues of the legitimacy of our arguments. This is a very important issue for Ireland, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area. From an economic perspective, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions in Ireland.The Commission's intention is to submit a proposal to the Council some time in the second half of 2011 with a view to adopting it in advance of 2014, when it will come into force. Council Conclusions were unanimously agreed at Council, which essentially summarise the work carried out to date on the revision of intermediate LFAs and the objectives, basis and methodology for future work. It is envisaged that any changes to the Scheme will not be introduced before 2014.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	941	Mindful of the hardship and distress caused by the widespread flooding experienced during the latter part of last year, on 27 November 2009 I announced the introduction of the Fodder Aid Scheme, targeted directly at those farmers who encountered damage to fodder in the affected areas. While I was very anxious that the funding reach the affected farmers as quickly as possible, it was essential that farmers demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and to what extent. To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection. Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the applications were further processed for payment.The Scheme required farmers to demonstrate that the fodder was damaged and the extent of that damage: the aid was only payable in instances where genuine damage to silage, hay, concentrates or straw was caused by the flooding in November 2009; applications were required to be submitted by Friday 18 December 2009; all applications were subject to an on-farm inspection, during which the damaged fodder was required to be evident; aid was not payable where flood damage to fodder was covered by the farmer's insurance policy.In addition, the financial assistance under the Fodder Aid Scheme was paid in accordance with State Aid regulation EC1535/2007 (de minimis aid in the agricultural production sector) — all applicants were required to complete a declaration in this regard.I am pleased to say that payments commenced issuing on 18 December and, to date, payments worth almost €530,000 have issued; payments continue to issue as individual cases are confirmed eligible. I am particularly pleased at the speed with which these payments have been made directly to the affected farmers. Of the 256 farmers who have benefited under this Scheme to date, eight had their payments capped at the maximum allowable under the de minimis rules i.e. €7,500. In these cases it was not possible to pay in excess in view State Aid de minimis rules.

The applications are being processed and, to date, 71 have been approved for payment. Twelve of the applications could not be accepted for processing and a further four applications have been rejected following processing as they did not meet the conditions of the Scheme.Of the total number of applications received, 39 were returned to the applicants as they were submitted under the provision of the Early Retirement Scheme that envisaged the transferees being set up under the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme.   As that scheme is closed to new applicants, the transferees in these cases could not satisfy that requirement.  The applicants were offered the option of resubmitting their applications under an alternative provision of the Scheme which involved the holding being enlarged by the transferee.  Thirty-three of these applications have been resubmitted on this basis and are currently being processed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	943	The Dairy Hardship Compensation Fund is part of a package of measures agreed at the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, as part of which €300 million was made available to support dairy farmers across the EU who were severely affected by the fall in milk prices.  Each Member State's share of this fund was calculated based on their milk production in the 2008/2009 milk quota year, and on this basis, Ireland received €11.5 million.Having consulted widely, I decided to allocate the money on a flat rate basis, as it was agreed that this was the optimum method of allocation to those dairy farmers most affected by the crisis. In order to keep red tape to a minimum, it was decided that dairy farmers would not have to submit an application for payment. Instead, payments were made to eligible farmers using the Single Payment System, the most efficient way possible. The flat rate payment equated to a rate of €590 to each farmer. While Member States were required to make the payments by the end of June 2010, the approach adopted by my Department allowed payments to commence in early March, with the majority of payments issuing at that stage.When initially considering eligibility under the Fund, it had been decided that only one payment would be made to each qualifying milk producer, Milk Partnerships being deemed to represent a single milk producer. Subsequently, following review, it was decided that an individual payment would be made to each member of a Milk Partnership and the necessary arrangements were made to give effect to this decision. I am pleased to say that this work has now been completed and payments will issue to 91 of the 105 partnership cases later this week. Those issues, highlighted at computer validation, which are currently preventing payment to the remaining 14 cases, are currently being investigated and, immediately they are resolved, payments will issue to the individuals concerned.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	944	The EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) provides a range of support measures that can be used to manage the dairy market, and these were modified in the CAP reforms of 1999 and 2003.  In the Health Check negotiations in 2008 there was pressure to remove or weaken the support measures significantly.  At that time I fought hard to keep the key market instruments in place and the importance of the retention of these support measures was proven in 2009 when the dairy market experienced a dramatic decline.  Last year I frequently pressed the Commission to take all appropriate measures to deal with the dairy market situation, and there is no doubt that the implementation of the range of support measures helped to stabilise the market in 2009.  I will continue to maintain close contact with the EU Commission and the Council to ensure that support measures are activated at levels that will make a real impact on the market.Dairy farmers incomes are comprised of the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  In Ireland the average producer milk price in 2009 was 24.1 cent/litre, and the dairy premium is 3.6 cent/litre.  Market forces have a major influence on the price paid to farmers for milk.  World market prices determine the returns received by dairy processors and these in turn are reflected in the price paid to farmers.  In essence, farm gate prices normally reflect the returns from international markets of dairy product sales.

The Group comprises representatives from all of the  relevant Divisions within FÁS including its Employment, Community, Training and  Service to Business Divisions, as well as its Planning and Research Unit and  Social Inclusion Unit.The FÁS Youth Framework Document is currently in draft format, and following  external consultation with other relevant bodies and/or organisations, will be  finalised in the near future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	948	The Government is committed to tackling unemployment, including youth unemployment. In successive budgets, we have allocated substantial additional  resources to provide increased training, education and work experience places  for the unemployed.  As a result, my Department will provide almost 190,000  training, education and work experience places this year specifically for the  unemployed.For early school leavers, the main specific provision continues to be training  at Community Training Centres and VECs under the Youthreach Programme. There  are currently 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.   The programme is directed at unemployed young early school leavers aged 15-20.  The programme provides basic skills and work experience and facilitates early  school leavers with opportunities to acquire certification and progress to  further training or employment.Another initiative, which is a way of preparing the unemployed for future job  opportunities, is the Work Placement Programme. This Programme is aimed at  providing up to nine-month work experience placements to the unemployed. The  programme consists of two streams each consisting of 1,000 places. The first  stream is for graduates and the second stream is for all others with 250 places  ring-fenced for those under 35 years of age. To date a total of 1,286  individuals have participated in the Programme and there are currently in  excess of 1,300 additional placements currently available.Under the Dutch Guaranteed Youth Employment Scheme, young people who have been  unemployed for a period are offered training and/or work experience. The work  experience concerned mainly consists of guaranteed places with the government  and in the subsidized sector. The scheme embodies an explicit sanctions policy:  those young people who repeatedly refuse to accept either training or work  experience lose their entitlement to a social security benefit.In Ireland, the Government have adopted a more incentive based approach to  encourage those under 25 who are unemployed to participate in activation  measures. For those under 23, unemployment benefit is reduced to €100 per week  and for those 23 and 24 years of age, unemployment benefit is reduced to €150  per week. However, should these individuals participate in any of the full-time  education, training or work experience programmes (including the Work Placement  Programme), then they will receive the full normal weekly allowance of €196.Between the Work Placement Programme, the increased number of training and  education places for the unemployed and the incentive based approach to social  benefits for those under 25 years of age, Ireland has in place a range of  measures designed to activate young people who are unemployed and maintain  their linkages with the labour market.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	951	I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department generally only holds records on  those former residents of Industrial & Reformatory Schools that were placed  there by way of a Court hearing.  There are many other institutions, some of  which are listed on the Schedule to the Redress Act, in respect of which my  Department had no involvement and, as a consequence, would not maintain any  records.However, in relation to the former residents of the Industrial & Reformatory  Schools, and in keeping with the spirit of Section 47 (4) (a) and (b) of the  Freedom of Information Act, there is no charge to any survivor seeking access  to personal records held by my Department.   I would like to reassure the  Deputy that my Department has dealt with approximately 13,000 requests for  personal records by survivors under the terms of the aforementioned Act and no  person has ever been charged for the issue of any personal records located.As the Deputy maybe aware, under Section 6(4)(a) and (5) of the Freedom of  Information Act, the provisions of that Act apply only to records created after  the commencement of the Act (in 1998) with the exception of records relating to  personal information.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	952	The responsibility for day to day management of schools is at local school  level. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the  safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are  on the school premises, during school time and/or on school activities. In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the  responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety  statement in place in their schools. The Statement should identify potential  hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in  place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Safety  Statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.In 2002, my Department agreed arrangements for the provision of funding for  supervision in respect of mid-morning and lunch-time breaks which are set out  in Circular 21/02. Specific arrangements apply in the case of small schools,  i.e. 1, 2 and 3 teacher schools.  In such schools, each teacher may claim  payment for up to 37 hours per school year for the provision of supervision  services.  Payment for further hours of supervision, up to a maximum of 122  hours per school year, is made by grant to the Board of Management of the  school.  Some or all of the 122 hours may be undertaken by an external  supervisor appointed by the school.  For example, if the teacher(s) in the  school opt out of the supervision scheme, all 122 hours can be undertaken by an  external supervisor.  My Department has no plans to introduce classroom assistants to small schools.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	953	Under the terms of the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, eighteen Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme.  This sum was broken down as follows: Property Transfers €76.86m; Cash Contribution €41.14m; Provision of Counselling Services €10.00m.In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the  form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat  in terms of the property and cash contributions. The alterations to the agreed  amounts have occurred where the State agreed to accept and has since received  cash in lieu of properties to the value of €13.28 million.  Hence, the  breakdown of the practical implications of the Indemnity Agreement is:  Property Transfers — €63.5m Cash Contributions — €54.5m Provision of Counselling Services — €10All cash contributions have been received as well as Counselling to the value  of €10 million. It was agreed in principle that 64 properties would be accepted  subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations.  This number has  reduced to 61 as the Department has since accepted and received a cash sum in  lieu of three properties where good and marketable title could not be  established.  As at 27th May 2010, good and marketable title has been  established on 33 properties which have been fully transferred.  The remaining  28 properties have not been fully and finally accepted by the Department under  the terms of the Indemnity Agreement. While physical transfers of these  properties have taken place, with the properties being in use or available for  use by the intended recipients, the Chief State Solicitor's Office continues to  pursue the legal requirements issue under the Indemnity Agreement.Of the €54.4m million paid in cash, €12.7million was earmarked for former  residents and their relatives in the form of grants to assist them access  educational services.  This is now the responsibility of the Education Finance  Board.  The balance in the fund, which is managed by the National Treasury  Management Agency, was €5.35m at end 2009.  The Board consists of a Chairperson  and 8 ordinary members, four of whom are former residents.  The remaining cash  was used towards the payment of redress awards to former residents by the  Residential Institutions Redress Board.As the Deputy will be aware following publication of the Ryan Report, the  Government and subsequently Dáil Éireann called on the Congregations to commit  to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation.  In response,  the Congregations are offering significant additional contributions, which they  have valued at €348.51m. More detailed work and discussion with the  Congregations will be required in relation to the detail of the property  offers. The Government has proposed to utilise the cash element of the  Congregations' offers of contributions which is intended to amount to €110m  over the next few years, to establish a Statutory Fund in keeping with the  all-party Motion passed by Dáil Éireann, supporting the proposal for a Trust  for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.   Following consultation with the Congregations and the former residents as to  the exact nature of the fund, how it will operate and the uses to which it will  be put, the arrangements for the Statutory Fund will be considered by the  Government.Having considered the report of the independent Panel appointed to assess  statements of their affairs submitted by the Congregations and the response of  the Congregations, the Government's view is that the overall costs of the  response to residential institutional abuse should be shared on a 50:50 basis  between the taxpayer and those responsible for the residential institutions.  Assuming that the Congregations' offers of contributions are fully realised,  the collective contribution of the Congregations would be €476.51m, leaving a  target of over €200m to reach the 50% share of some €680m. The Government has  requested that additional contributions be provided to the greatest degree  possible in cash as a contribution to the planned National Children's Hospital.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The assessment of means under my Department's third level student maintenance grant schemes is based on gross income from all sources, with specified social welfare and health service executive payments being excluded from the calculation.For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents or legal guardian from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income or legal guardian's income must be taken into account. Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income or that of a legal guardian. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.Under the student grant schemes all mature candidates, if approved, are automatically provided with the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance which, this year, ranges from €810 to €6,355 depending on individual circumstances.  The entitlement to the non-adjacent rate applies regardless of how far the college is from the mature candidate's residence and whether or not the candidate is dependent on or independent of his/her parent(s) or guardian(s).  In addition, the childcare costs of a number of students are also supported under the ESF-aided Student Assistance Fund, which is resourced by my Department and allocated directly to students by their higher education institutions.Changes in the rates of student grant are considered as part of the annual  Budget process each year and rates become effective on a financial, rather than  an academic year basis.

Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the initial focus of this analysis is on primary school accommodation requirements and this will be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary accommodation requirements.  Overall school accommodation requirements in the Tyrellstown and Mulhuddart areas, including any requirement for a gaelscoil and additional post-primary accommodation, are being considered as part of this process.  However, the Deputy will be aware that a new post-primary school with capacity to accommodate 1,000 pupils is currently under construction in Phibblestown which should assist in easing any accommodation pressure at post-primary in the Tyrellstown/ Mulhuddart area in the short-term.My Department has recently completed the purchase of a site in Tyrellstown  under the Fingal Model Agreement intended to accommodate two schools.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	962	A reply from the former Minister for Education and Science Mr. Batt O' Keeffe T.D. issued to the candidate referred to by the Deputy on the 7th of October  2009.Clause 2.2 of the Higher Education Grants Scheme provides that a candidate is not eligible to hold a grant if s/he holds:"(i) a scholarship/grant awarded by another Local Authority,  a Vocational  Education Committee or the Department of Education and Science, or(ii) any other award payable from public funds, or(iii) the equivalent of (i) or (ii) from another E.U. Member StateThe provisions at (ii) or (iii) do not include awards such as scholarships, prizes or bursaries, made by the institution being attended or postgraduate research grants where the grant received does not exceed a specified amount, which for the 2009/2010 academic year, is specified to be €16,000."As the total value of the postgraduate research grant award to the candidate referred to by the Deputy exceeded the specified amount in each year of his doctorate degree as outlined in Clause 2.2, he is ineligible for a maintenance grant under the Higher Education Grant Scheme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	963	I propose to take Questions Nos. 626 and 627 together.Chapter 11(n) of the Primary Board of Management Information Manual, issued in 2007 to all members of Boards of Management of primary schools, refers to the rights of pupils and parents regarding religious instruction.It states that the State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State. It also states that under Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.Provision is made for the inclusion of religious education on the curriculum for primary schools. Thirty minutes of the standard school day of five hours and forty minutes is allocated for this purpose.However, parents also have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction.The provisions regarding religious instruction in Primary Schools are also set out in rules 68 and 69 of the Rules for National schools. These rules state, inter alia, that:No pupil shall receive, or be present at, any religious instruction of which his parents or guardians disapprove.The periods of formal religious instruction shall be fixed so as to facilitate the withdrawal of pupils where above appliesWhere such religious instruction as their parents or guardians approve is not provided in the school for any section of the pupils, such pupils must, should their parents or guardians so desire, be allowed to absent themselves from school, at reasonable times, for the purpose of receiving that instruction elsewhere.In the event that the religious education programme being followed in a school  is contrary to the conscience of a parent, arrangements should be entered into  at local school level to facilitate the required outcome.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	964	I can inform the Deputy that a psychologist from my Department's National  Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) conducted an educational assessment on the pupil referred to in this question on 17th June, 2010.  A feedback meeting on the assessment findings was held between the psychologist and the school authorities and parents in question on 21st June. A formal report on the matter is currently in preparation and should issue to the parents and school by the end of July.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	965	The provision of an additional Early Start unit for Traveller children would be contrary to the recommendations set out in the 2006 Traveller Education Strategy. This strategy built on earlier reports, including the 1995 Task Force on the Travelling Community which specifically recommended the end of segregated provision at all levels of the Education system. This includes the pre-school sector.With the introduction in January 2010 of universal pre-school provision (ECCE scheme) for all children, all children, whether from minority or majority groups are entitled to a free pre-school year of appropriate programme-based activities in the year before they start primary school. There are sufficient places available for pre-school children within community and private pre-schools. Adding a segregated Early Start unit for Traveller children would be contrary to principles of inclusion and against the recommendations of an agreed strategy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	966	The candidate referred to by the Deputy was awarded the full non-adjacent rate of grant for the 2009 academic year.  I understand that the candidate did not qualify for the Special Rate of maintenance grant as total reckonable income in this case exceeded the qualifying threshold and the awarding authority's decision in this regard was upheld on appeal by my Department.  If there has since been a change of circumstances with regard to reckonable income, the candidate may apply to the awarding authority to be re-assessed on that basis.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	967	The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools are published annually on my Department's website. Department Circular 0015/2009 set out the resources available to schools for language support (EAL) and is also available on the Department website. Under present arrangements a school can be allocated up to 4 language support  teachers.Additional support is also available for those schools which have at least 25%  of their total enrolment made up of pupils that require language support (pupils with less than B1 (Level 3) proficiency). Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the Staffing Appeals process.I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. The Board determined that the school was ineligible to appeal and thus a departure from the EAL staffing schedule was not warranted in this case. The school has been notified in this regard. The  Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	968	I have arranged for officials of my Department to provide the information requested directly to the person named by the Deputy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	969	As the Deputy may be aware, historically, it was church authorities rather than the State that acquired the vast majority of land for educational purposes.  In the recent past, the Department relied primarily on the Office of Public Works (OPW) to source and acquire suitable lands for schools.  More recently the  Department has utilised a number of avenues to acquire land, including the VEC sector, Local Authorities, the OPW and direct negotiations by Department officials.  The detailed historical information in the format sought by the  Deputy is not readily available in the Department. However, the vast majority of expenditure on sites in recent years occurred in rapidly developing areas.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	975	As the Deputy is aware, School Transport was approved by Government as a topic for inclusion as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews.This review is looking at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these  objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being  achieved, and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies  that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the  review is also looking at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and  catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money  in the Scheme.The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is  currently being finalised.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	976	I wish to advise the Deputy that it is my Department's intention to use the  site in question for buildings for educational purposes, in accordance with  demand for such facilities and the availability of the necessary resources.My Department is not aware that there are any issues regarding the condition of  the site.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	977	The new post primary school referred to by the Deputy, is one of eight schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership.This bundle is in the pre procurement stage. Detailed output specifications and  Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) are being finalised and outline planning permission has been received in respect of the eight schools. Following completion of the pre procurement process, the Bundle will be ready for handover to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for procurement.The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a PPP school currently stands at approximately 4 years from the date the Bundle is announced.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	978	Special needs assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles. The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.My Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme. This is a comprehensive review of the rationale for the scheme, including the role of the SNA.  It is expected that this review will be completed in 2010.  The report, when completed, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	979	As part of the multi-annual school building programme, my Department has invested heavily in the modernisation of school facilities throughout the country, including science facilities in post-primary schools. Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level. Typically, this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Scheme to refurbish science laboratories. Under my Department's 2009/10 Summer Works Scheme, 11 schools were approved grant aid to facilitate the refurbishment of science laboratories.Additionally, the Department has funded the provision of class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.

Following discussions with the ABA tutors' union, it has been agreed that the ABA tutors will become Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in the special schools.  The question of ignoring Departmental circulars does not arise as the normal terms and conditions of the SNA grade will apply.  A redundancy package has been agreed for any ABA tutor who does not wish to transfer to the new special schools.

In the case of the appointment of a local authority member to Dublin City University, Section 16(5)(a)(i) of the Act specifies that a committee of the Governing authority shall be established comprising the Chief Officer of the university and two other members, nominated for that purpose, by the councils of the administrative counties of Fingal, South Dublin and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and the Corporation of Dublin county borough.Neither I nor my Department has any role to play in relation to the process for nominating persons to this committee.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	982	Interactive Whiteboards play an important part in the integration of ICT across the curriculum in schools.  They offer opportunities for student participation and increased classroom interactivity.  However, effective investment in this technology is dependent on an existing positive ICT culture in schools, teachers who are experienced in using ICT in the classroom and on an existing desirable level of ICT access throughout the school.  The 2008 ICT Strategy recommends a baseline of a fixed digital projector and teaching computer for each classroom.  The 2009 Smart Schools = Smart Economy Report supports this recommendation.  My Department issued €22m in ICT grants to primary schools in 2009.  Under this grant schools were required to purchase the recommended baseline equipment before the purchase of equipment such as interactive whiteboards.Statistics in relation to the level of interactive whiteboards in use on a county basis is not currently available.  A recent ICT survey of post primary schools indicated that the availability of interactive whiteboards is not an ICT priority at post primary level.  A survey on the use of ICT in primary schools will take place in the autumn.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	984	I propose to take Questions Nos. 648 to 653, inclusive, together.The following table contains details of the institutions, programmes, student numbers and costs involved in providing part-time undergraduate and postgraduate places for unemployed people from September 2009.It is estimated that in excess of 3,000 applications were received for places under the scheme, almost 2,100 offers of places were made and more than 1,750 places were filled.The take up of the scheme is regarded as high given the short lead in time available to advertise and to recruit potential students, the specific focus of the courses available and the geographical spread of the programme offerings. Admission requirements for higher education programmes are a matter for the individual institution but it could be expected that not all applicants for the places available would have met the entry requirements for a particular course. In addition, a number of students made applications to more than one programme/institution but would only be able to take a place on one course.  The HEA worked very closely with the colleges concerned throughout the period of the application process to ensure, to the extent possible, that when places on particular programmes were not filled due to lack of demand those places were then reallocated to other programmes and institutions.Undergraduate ProgrammesLevelNumber of Places FilledDuration of CoursesAttritionStudent Numbers 1st March 2010Cost based on Final Verified Numbers€

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	986	Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.  Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.In accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour.  These guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and state, inter alia, that the Board of Management of a school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and that schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.My Department's "Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Primary and Post-Primary Schools" were issued in September 1993, as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.In 2007 my Department published, on its website, policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying.  The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies and takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes.  Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) was established in 2006 in response to the recommendation in "School Matters", the report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools.  The NBSS is currently working with over 70 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.The National Centre for Technology in Education's Webwise Internet Safety initiative includes an integrated educational programme with the following elements:1. The development of an integrated educational programme in partnership with the SPHE Support Service called — Be Safe Be Webwise, which is delivered in the context of the SPHE module on Personal Safety by the SPHE Second Level Support Service2. Delivery of Internet Safety Seminars for parents in schools in partnership with the National Parents Council Primary3. Provision of Internet safety continuing professional development training for teachers4. The Watch Your Space awareness campaign, which was launched in February 2007, seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line.  The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the NCTE.  This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web.  A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites5. The EU Safer Internet Programme campaign WATCH_YOUR_SPACE — STOP CYBERBULLYING was launched in 2009.  This social marketing campaign combined blanket and targeted messages delivered through a wide range of media channels and involving children and young people themselves, to the promotion of effective responses to cyber bullying by young people.  In Ireland, the campaign included an on-line source of information and advice for young people, watchyourspace.ie, and the TEENTXT active listening service of the ISPCCThe education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is also part of the SPHE curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.

They have access to a Pension Scheme and other entitlements. The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. There were 193 primary school secretaries on my Department's payroll on 31st March 2010.The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided.  With regard to salaries for secretaries, a forum has been set up with the aim of establishing the position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of school secretaries. The forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance and includes the relevant management bodies and the unions involved.

The institutions approved under the scheme are, generally speaking, publicly funded third level colleges offering full-time courses at undergraduate and post-graduate level.On-line or distance learning courses are not regarded as full-time programmes of study. Accordingly, such courses are not included under the Higher Education Grants Scheme.Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full-time and part-time courses in both private and publicly-funded third level colleges and universities. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.

This investment has now led us to a point where there are structured professional development opportunities for all school leaders in our system from their point of appointment to day of retirement.Both Misneach and Tánaiste are professional development programmes for newly appointed school Principals and Deputy Principals respectively,Misneach is a professional development programme for newly appointed school leaders. This programme seeks to help new leaders to meet these challenges by developing their personal and professional capacities.  The programme consists of 4 modules based on the following:  — Leading Learning, Leading People, Leading the organisation and Personal development.Tánaiste aims to develop the skills necessary for Deputy Principals to approach their role with confidence and to work effectively with the Principal and other school leaders to ensure high quality teaching and learning in the school.Both these programmes consist of various modules which include leadership skills, motivating and inspiring staff in schools as well as self motivation for the leaders themselves.In September 2008 LDS, in conjunction with NUI Maynooth, introduced Toraíocht, a formal training programme for aspiring school leaders. The Toraíocht Programme was designed in conjunction with the Department of Education at Maynooth and the wider educational partners and responds to the need for motivation and professional development that prepares school leaders of the future. This Programme has been highly successfully with the first cohort of students graduating in March 2010.The information sought by the Deputy on the number of new school principals is not currently available.  Relevant information will be forwarded to the Deputy directly when it becomes available.

The Council or any person  may apply to the Investigating Committee for an inquiry into the fitness to  teach of a registered teacher where: the teacher has failed to comply with or has contravened the Teaching Council  Act, 2001, the Education Act, 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 or the  Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1999, or any regulations rules or orders  made under those Acts; the teacher's behaviour constitutes professional misconduct; the teacher's registration is erroneous due to a false or fraudulent  declaration or misrepresentation; he or she is medically unfit to teach.When it is deemed appropriate to do so, the Council's Disciplinary Committee  will conduct a hearing on a complaint referred to it by the Investigating  Committee. Such hearings may lead to withdrawal of registration on a temporary  or permanent basis.  Draft rules of procedure for panels of the disciplinary  committee of the Teaching Council, as required in Section 2 of Schedule 3 of  the 2001 Act have been drawn up by the Teaching Council.Discussions between my Department and the Teaching Council regarding the  commencement of Part 5 have taken place and the Teaching Council has indicated  its view that Part 5 and Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 should be  commenced together.  As previously stated, it is intended that Section 30 of  the Teaching Council Act be commenced in the near future. The commencement of  the section will include provision for it to be regulated that a school may  employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in exceptional  circumstances, and this necessitates a change to the primary legislation.I intend to commence both Part 5 and Section 30 as soon as is practicable.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1000	Since the introduction of the moratorium in March 2009 and up until 30 June  2010 a total of 18 teachers with allowances for posts as assistant principals  and 34 teaches with allowances for post as special duties teachers have retired  from primary schools throughout Cork.When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy  Principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these  continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is  therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances  payable to teachers on promotion.Unlike other areas of the public service retirement vacancies are actually  being filled and what the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by  awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher. The position whereby just  over 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.Further retirements and promotions later this year will impact further on  middle management posts. I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on  middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools and as I have already  acknowledged the impact is not just due to the level of retirements but also as  a consequence of promotions that are made to principal and deputy principal  posts. In this context I have agreed with the Minister for Finance arrangements  for a limited derogation from the general moratorium on the filling of  promotion posts in schools. These measures are set out in Department Circular  0042/2010 which is now available on my Department website.

I indicated my view  that the introduction of CAO bonus points for achievement in Leaving  Certificate mathematics at higher level would send an important signal to  students. I also wrote to the President of the Irish Universities Association,  the Chairperson of Institutes of Technology Ireland and the President of the  DIT asking them to look favourably at the introduction of a workable CAO bonus  points scheme which would encourage those at risk of dropping down to ordinary  level to sit the exam at higher level.  Consultations within and between  colleges on the matter are currently being progressed.The Council of Registrars in the Institutes of Technology has indicated their  support for bonus points, recommending that it would be best that any bonus  scheme or scale is agreed on a system-wide basis, with a common scheme offered  by all Higher Education Institutes. More recently the Irish Universities  Association has written to me indicating that a number of universities have  decided in principle to award bonus points with effect from 2012, and that the  matter is receiving attention in a number of other colleges. In addition a  number of technical issues are being discussed. The Association will keep me  informed of progress in the matter.

The common day date is well advertised prior to the  start of the programme and gives both parents and teachers an exact date on  which they can expect payment from my Department.These arrangements worked exceptionally well in 2009.  No child was in any way  disadvantaged by its introduction.  As previously advised, the decision in 2010 to change the common pay date from  30 September, as in 2009, to 11 November was made after consideration of the  available staffing resources within my Department.

The programme is managed within this context,  with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of  participants and the community.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the  active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return  to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their  technical and personal skills.Within the current very difficulty budgetary constraints, the number of places  on CE have been increased to 23,300 in 2010. In delivering these places, FÁS  will continue to operate flexibly in the management of this allocation in order  to maximise progression to the labour market, while at the same time  facilitating the support of community services.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	My Department operates payrolls for the payment of approximately 85,000 serving  and retired teaching and non teaching staff on a fortnightly basis.A total of 913 applications for the cycle to work scheme for 2010 have been  processed for the serving teaching and non teaching staff paid on these  payrolls.  The applications for the scheme were processed with existing  staffing resources.As a high percentage of retirements and new appointments take place at the  commencement of the new school year the period from July to December is a very  busy one for the section involved with paying the teaching and non teaching  staff on the payrolls.  Accordingly, it is not possible to process further  applications for the cycle to work scheme this year.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I do intend to allow greater flexibility  for application to the scheme in 2011. A Circular outlining the revised terms  of the scheme for 2011 will issue in the near future.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1015	The arrangements currently in place for school transport annual charges, namely  €300 per eligible and concessionary post primary pupil, €200 for concessionary  primary pupil and a maximum family charge of €650 will remain in place for the  2010/2011 school year. As the Deputy will be aware eligible primary children  and children with special educational needs are currently transported free of  charge and charges are waived in the case of eligible post primary children  where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.The Deputy will also be aware that the McCarthy report made recommendations to  levy charges, at both primary and post primary level, at a rate of €500 per  annum per child or 50% of the full economic cost of providing the service, with  the exemption for social welfare recipients continuing to apply.The recommendations in the McCarthy report fall to be considered as part of the  annual estimates and budget process. It would not be appropriate to comment  specifically on whether any of these recommendations or indeed other  expenditure issues will be included in next years estimates and budget prior to  Government consideration and decisions on estimates 2011.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1016	As the Deputy will be aware my Department recently submitted a planning  application for two sixteen classroom schools. This application was made as part  of the exchange of contracts for the acquisition of the potential school  site.    As part of the pre-planning process my officials met with the Local  Authority planners.  It was not considered necessary to meet with the education  partners in relation to this planning application.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1017	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE)  is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate  staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational  needs in mainstream and special schools. The NCSE operates within my  Department's policy in allocating this support.The correspondence referred to by the Deputy raises issues in relation to  consultation and planning in the context of Circular 0038/2010 issued by my  Department in May this year. I wish to clarify that the purpose of the circular  is to signal the process through which enrolment practices and resource  allocations will be addressed in Special Schools for the 2011/12 school year  and to set out the transition arrangements that will apply in relation to these  issues for the 2010/11 school year. The Circular explains that the Department  of Education and Skills and the NCSE met with representatives of the Catholic  Primary School Management Association (CPSMA), the National Association of  Boards of Management in Special Education (NABMSE), the Irish National Teachers  Organisation (INTO) and the National Parents Council Primary to consider these  issues with a view to putting a process in place to engage in a collaborative  manner to clarify the position on these issues and to identify appropriate  staffing arrangements which will apply with effect from the 2011/2012 school  year. It was agreed that the parties will consult further in the near future in  this regard.As such, I would be grateful if the Deputy could advise the correspondent to  also ensure that her concerns are brought to the attention of her relevant  representative body, so that these views might be represented on her behalf at  the upcoming consultation process.The correspondence also refers to engagement regarding the report on Special  Schools and Classes. I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Research Report  on the role of Special Schools and Classes in Ireland was commissioned by the  NCSE. I have received a copy of this report. This research, including  recommendations, needs to be considered first of all by the NCSE. While the  NCSE has funded this research, the report clearly states that the views and  opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or  opinions of the NCSE.I understand that the report may be one of a number of many strands of evidence  to be considered by the NCSE when formulating its position in relation to  special schools and special classes. Ultimately, it is expected that advice  received from the NCSE will assist my Department with policy formulation in  relation to the role of special schools and special classes. I look forward to receiving the considered views of the NCSE in relation to  this issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1018	I propose to take Questions Nos. 687 to 689, inclusive, together.The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the  country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a  requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and  post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using  data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the  Department of Social Protection and with reference to recent schools' enrolment  data. Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the initial focus of  this analysis has been on primary school accommodation requirements. This will  be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary school accommodation  requirements. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary  provision in the short to medium term is likely to be greatest in more than 40  identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the  demographics of those areas.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis  and reports for each of these initial identified areas in order to identify  school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school  year 2014/15. School accommodation requirements in the Midleton/ Carrigtwohill  area have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified  areas, which indicates that up 38 additional primary classrooms may be required  across that area to cater for increased enrolments up to the school year  2014/15. When the required reports have been completed for all the initial  identified areas Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing  reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country. School  accommodation requirements in the remainder of the East Cork area will be  considered as part of this process.Any proposed building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis  will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School  Building and Modernisation Programme.

I have been advised by the Commission that it  continues to assess the situation and has sought special reports, in addition  to the normal reporting, from the examination superintendents who were  invigilating the Leaving Certificate Accounting examination sessions in the 16  schools affected by the production error in the examination paper. The SEC is  also considering correspondence received from the schools and candidates, and  their parents, involved. Consequently this matter is ongoing  and will be kept  under review by the SEC.

However, clause 11.1 of the Higher  Education Grant Scheme provides the awarding authorities with discretion to  accept applications after this date and treat such applications as if they had  been received on time.  Therefore, the candidate referred to by the Deputy  should take up the matter with the relevant local authority in Cork in this  instance.
