          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2020-11-26T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">This is the second day of our two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I welcome all of our witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The matters for examination today are from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services 2019; chapter 11 - measuring performances for Exchequer spend on social housing; chapter 12 - progress under the land aggregation scheme; and chapter 13 - the pyrite remediation scheme. To assist us in our examination of these matters, and with regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John O'Connor, chief executive of the Housing Agency and Ms Marguerite Ryan, finance officer. We are also joined remotely by the following officials from the housing delivery division: Mr. Barry Quinlan, assistant secretary; Ms Sarah Neary, principal adviser; Mr. David Kelly, principal officer; and by Ms Clare Costello from the housing Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I welcome all of our witnesses and I thank staff in the Department for the briefing material they prepared for the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations that they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything that they say at the meeting. Witnesses are expected, however, not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused. If statements by witnesses are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that witnesses comply with such directions. While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly, frankly and concisely, because we are under time constraint in terms of health regulations, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policy. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to him or her identifiable. I ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure that they can be heard and that when members are leaving and taking their seats they sanitise their area. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamas McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2020-11-26T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">I resume my opening statement at chapter 11. Departments are obliged to demonstrate that they have used funding provided by or under the authority of Dáil Éireann for the purposes intended and to good effect. This requires them to have relevant and reliable measures of their performance that are linked to identified lines of funding. The annual appropriation accounts present details of the amounts made available by the Dáil in the Estimates for each programme and how much was spent. Information about what has been achieved with that spending is more difficult to find and to understand. For this report, I wanted to look at the €2.4 billion housing programme, to assess the kind of performance information that is available in social housing delivery. The main objective of the assessment was to establish if the performance measures used and published by the Department provide a complete and accurate account of what is being achieved by the spending in a timely way.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> At the outset, I want to acknowledge that monitoring and reporting on the performance of the various public bodies involved in social housing support is a complex process. Authorities in many jurisdictions are working to improve their own performance measurement systems in this area and those systems evolve over time. As part of the annual Estimates process, the Department reports on a range of key housing-related output and activity measures. The data presented indicate that the Department has achieved or substantially achieved most of the performance targets it has set. These are predominantly output targets that measure aspects of the programme-funded activity. However, we found that the measures used are not well aligned with the nature of the activity that is funded. Some substantial funding lines in the Vote have no output or activity measures associated with them. Some measures appear to relate to a number of funding lines, so it is difficult to see what contribution each spending channel is making. A number of the measures and targets relate to incremental values rather than to the full scale of support provided through the funding stream. For example, one measure relates to the number of new housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies put in place in the year. A better measure relating to the annual spend on HAP would be the average weekly number of HAP tenancies supported in the year. We found that none of the measures focus on economy or efficiency aspects of performance. There was more focus on target outputs than on planned outcomes for households in need of support. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The report makes a number of recommendations for improvement in the Department’s performance reporting. For example, we propose that they could develop new outcome and effectiveness metrics; they could express targets in percentage terms to facilitate benchmarking; and they could examine the potential to introduce qualitative indicators. The report also highlights some performance measurement issues, with implications across all votes. </p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Turning to chapter 12, progress under the land aggregation scheme, LAGS, the scheme was established in 2010 to provide assistance to local authorities with land purchase loans that were maturing. The local authorities had bought the land for social and affordable housing purposes but were not in a position to go ahead with housing development. In return for LAGS funding paid from the Vote, local authorities were required to transfer the related land to a special purpose body called Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd., known as the Housing Agency. No new applications for site transfers under the scheme were accepted after December 2013. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The position at September 2020 was that 68 of the 73 sites approved under the LAGS had been fully transferred by local authorities and registered in the ownership of the Housing Agency. For the remaining five sites, beneficial ownership had transferred to the agency but title registration had not yet been completed. In a 2018 strategic development plan, the Housing Agency categorised 36 of the LAGS sites as ready for immediate development. Those sites were assessed as having the potential to accommodate 3,370 housing units. At the time the report was signed off, 98 social housing units had been completed on the sites and a further 792 units were at various stages of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The 2018 development plan stated that the remaining 37 sites were not suitable for immediate development for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Chapter 13 deals with the pyrite remediation scheme. As members may know, pyrite is a common mineral found in certain types of rock that can swell and lead to structural problems in buildings. Towards the end of the development boom over a decade ago, pyrite-related damage emerged as a problem for homeowners. The majority of the identified cases were located in two local authority areas: Fingal and Meath. In 2013, the Pyrite Resolution Board was established to direct and oversee the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme. The Housing Agency is responsible for the administration of the scheme, on behalf of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Initial estimates were that over 10,000 homes might be in need of expensive repairs. The out-turn has been significantly less. Up to the end of 2019, 2,110 applications had been approved for inclusion in the scheme and a further 301 were at the application or assessment stage. By the end of 2019, remediation works were completed on 1,890 properties and the scheme had cost the Exchequer nearly €126 million. Costs per home remediated have averaged around €65,000. Future projections up to 2023 indicate the scheme will cost approximately €210 million and will remediate approximately 3,140 dwellings.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Under the Act, the board may recover from any party with a liability, and the capacity to pay, all or part of the costs of remediating damaged dwellings. Costs of the scheme recouped from third parties to the end of 2019 amounted to just under €1.8 million, representing 1.4% of total costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Support to the value of a further €1.8 million had been received from HomeBond, which had provided structural defect guarantees or warranties for an estimated 74% of the eligible scheme applications. This support was in the form of technical and project management services.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The board estimated that by the end of 2019, it had spent just over €887,000 on remediating non-pyrite related defects that it could potentially claim from HomeBond. Just 6% of that amount had been recovered from the company. The report recommended that the board and the Housing Agency put in place a more robust process to quantify and recover the cost of remediating such non-pyrite related defects.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Secretary General delivered his comprehensive opening statement yesterday. I understand that today he will deliver some preliminary remarks about the matters under discussion, which will be followed by an introduction by Mr. John O'Connor, the chief executive of the Housing Agency. I call Mr. Doyle.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the engagement on the wider Vote yesterday evening. We will come back on any items that were identified during the course of that engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I am pleased to be here as Accounting Officer to assist the committee in its examination of the three areas covered in chapters 11 to 13, inclusive, of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report, that is: performance measurement for Exchequer funding on social housing; progress under the land aggregation scheme; and the pyrite remediation scheme. We have Mr. John O’Connor, chief executive of the Housing Agency, with us. Given the role the agency plays in the implementation of both the land aggregation scheme and the pyrite remediation scheme we thought it would be very useful to have Mr. O'Connor give a presentation to the committee. I am joined by a number of experts to assist with that on these three particular areas. The Chairman has already introduced them so it might be useful if Mr. O'Connor took us through his presentation now.</p>

          <from> Mr. John O'Connor<recordedTime time="2020-11-26T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">I thank the Chairman. In the four minutes I will give an overview of the pyrite remediation scheme and the land aggregation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I will first give a quick overview of the pyrite remediation scheme. Pyrite is a mineral that is found in rock and it affects the hard core. If we take the floor of this committee room, it would be the stone underneath the floor. It expands and starts pushing up the floor, which causes damage to the floor and begins to cause cracks in the walls. The damage can be very significant. It causes many cracks in the walls of houses of a structural nature and the floors start to be pushed up, which is very distressing for homeowners.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The pyrite remediation scheme applies to certain parts where pyritic heave is being caused. The majority of cases where we have remediated houses have been in Fingal County Council and Meath. They account for 90% of all the houses remediated.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> To be eligible for one's house to be remediated, it has to be damaged to a certain level. It is called a damage condition rating of 2 and it has to be as a result of pyritic heave. The work we have to carry out in a house is very intrusive. On the screen are some pictures of that. We have to dig out the entire ground floor slab, take out all the stone underneath the ground floor slab, put the stone back in and the floor back down. We then finish the house in that we put back the floor finishes and paint the walls so the ground floor of the house is handed back to homeowners in show house condition. To date, we have remediated 2,029 homes and handed them back to homeowners. That is an overview of the pyrite remediation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I will give a quick overview of the land aggregation scheme. Arrangements were put in place to clear the loans for 73 sites and they have been transferred to the Housing Agency. There are 247 ha in total. That is 600 acres around the country. The diagram shows where the sites are located across the country. As I said, 73 sites in all were transferred and every number of years we do a strategic plan in respect of those sites, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in terms of plans to develop those sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I will give the members some examples of what has been done with the sites. The first one is in Portlaoise town. It is a development of 33 houses provided for social housing by Laois County Council. On the slide is another example of a social housing development. It is the largest social housing development in Galway city, on the Ballymoneen Road, which is being done. Phase 1 is complete and phase 2 is under construction. Another example is in Craddockstown, Naas, which is part of a wider bundle under a public private partnership, PPP, project undertaken by the National Development Finance Agency, in conjunction with local authorities. All of those are for social housing. Other parts of that site we will use for other purposes. The slide shows another one in Stepaside, Dublin. It is a development of 155 homes done in conjunction with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Respond and two housing associations. There will be 105 for social housing and 50 for cost rental. That development will be completed next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Some sites are more appropriate for mixed use. The site on the screen is in Fermoy where a school has been constructed on half of the site. We have transferred that to the Department of Education. On the other part of the site housing has been completed by the Respond housing association, again for social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The last example is the Devoy lands in Naas, which are beside the Kildare County Council offices. Part of that land is being used for an enterprise building for start-up businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">This is for start-up businesses being built by Kildare County Council. Part of the site will be used for housing development. The Housing Agency is working with the Land Development Agency to develop that for over 200 houses and apartments. They will all be either for social or affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> At a very high level, in terms of any lands under the land aggregation scheme to date the plans are to use it for public purposes for social housing, affordable housing and other public purposes. In terms of the remit, everything has to be sanctioned by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The focus has been on using it for social housing, affordable housing and for all our public uses. That is a very quick overview. </p>

          <p eId="para_43">I thank Mr. O'Connor for the useful information he provided on the land aggregation scheme. Pyrite was a major issue during the Thirty-first Dáil and many of us were scratching our heads over how it might be resolved. It is good to see that level of progress on it for the people caught up in that unfortunate situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I welcome our guests, Mr. Doyle, Mr. O'Connor and Ms Ryan in the room, and all those who are joining us via Teams. I hope to keep my questions short and hope the witnesses can keep their responses short so that we can cover as much territory as possible. I hope to cover Chapters 11, measuring performance for Exchequer spending on social housing; Chapter 12, progress under the land aggregation scheme; and Chapter 13, the pyrite remediation scheme, which both witnesses covered in their opening remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> I start with measuring performance. The Comptroller and Auditor General made a very clear assessment in believing that the measurements were not well aligned with the nature and activity of the funding that was being spent. A different way of saying that is that the targets might have been too easily achieved. The value for money and the overall impact of the spending was not taken into account. How has the Department responded to that? What relevant targets does it intend to include in future accounts?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Mr. Graham Doyle<recordedTime time="2020-11-26T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_47">I thank the Deputy for that. I am not quite sure that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General said in terms of the targets being easy to achieve. I know I am new to the Department, but I know a huge amount of effort has gone into achieving targets and, obviously, more has to be done given the nature of the situation around housing - certainly the issue on aligning the targets that are published with the actual spend categories, as the Deputy says.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> I know people say this, but the chapter is genuinely useful to us. I am a chartered accountant by profession. I came into the Civil Service a number of years ago into another Department. I am very focused on the need for good performance indicators and that what gets done gets measured, and the importance of numbers as we look at what is now a really considerable spend. The Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report that on social housing from, I think 2016 to 2019, the spend is about two and a half times greater. It is very important that we measure appropriately.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The chapter is largely focused on the REV, which is published each year. We have gone from about nine performance indicators in 2016 to 19 now. We are now reviewing what is there and how we can add to it. It is coming quite quickly, but in the REV that is coming out shortly we will probably have a couple of additional indicators in taking account of the report. Over the course of this year, we will look at that in greater detail with a view to the next REV having a more comprehensive set.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">While the indicators measure the output, in some cases there was a failure to understand the economic element and the value-for-money element. Let me take two examples. A housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy has an indicator. Many of us in the room would have dealt with a family who might have become homeless, availed of emergency accommodation, exited emergency accommodation, taken up a HAP tenancy and after 12 months or another period found themselves back in emergency accommodation and back in a second HAP tenancy. That is very clearly bad value for money, albeit market driven. Many of us would like to see greater focus on value for money and less on counting what is effectively two exits from homelessness.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I think the HAP example is a particularly good one. When we talk about the number of additional tenancies that would be supported in a particular year when the budget comes around or whatever, we lose sight of the fact, and do not necessarily automatically point out, that this chunk of money is actually covering this number of tenancies. That is a very valid point.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> In his initial intervention, the Deputy talked about the variety of schemes. In coming to the Department, I have tried to get my head around all the different ways a house can be delivered and all the different funding mechanisms. It is quite a challenge. They are all tools in the box, as we talked about yesterday. There are multiple funding streams and we have to report on the funding streams, but tying that to the outputs is a challenge and is a difficult process. I know the Comptroller and Auditor General certainly accepted the complexity of it. We have to try to crack that and align those things better. Given my own background, it is particularly important that we do that given the amount by which we have ramped up spending.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I do not want to delve too deeply into the policy area. In highlighting those issues, we are highlighting that the policies were revenue intensive and, in many ways, they were short-term because of the immediate shortage. Their value for money and efficiency, and the more holistic aspect in terms of being more than just a home were not considered by the policy. The accounting is really just a reflection of what was actually happening in the policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">Some of the measures were adopted in the sense of the emergency that existed. We did a little bit of talking yesterday evening on that in terms of what was available to the State, what kind of armoury was available to the State as the housing problem emerged and the speed of it. Certainly, the answer has to be much more build and direct delivery. We need to be showing the balance. We talked yesterday about needing to reduce the HAP numbers over time as delivery improves. Delivery has significantly improved over the last number of years. It still has a long way to go and we have to focus on that so the measures we use and the way we report it has to acknowledge that, exactly as the Deputy says.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I am sure many people in the political space would agree that HAP is a total waste of taxpayers' money over a long period. Our failure to wean ourselves off HAP over the past ten or more years has been a failure of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> Mr. Doyle spoke about the supply of housing. I ask about the land aggregation and Mr. O'Connor might like to answer some of these questions. Let us cast our minds back to the financial crisis because that was the context of it. Somebody described this scheme to me as NAMA for local authorities. One would imagine some drop in value as a result of that context. A total of 73 sites were identified, with 72 of them purchased for a total of €125 million. In 2018 they were valued at €55 million which represents a halving of value. There are bigger questions on land values and so on at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The bigger issue for me is that it was a scheme that was intended to deliver just under 3,500 units and we have only delivered 98.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">That is a major issue. It appears that more than half the sites transferred from local authorities to the land aggregation scheme were not suitable for housing. One would have to ask why they were purchased in the first place if they are not suitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">On the lands that were bought, the loans were cleared. The value has gone down. That would be the same for nearly all lands bought during that period. On using the lands, it takes time to come up with plans, to develop them. Our first focus was on getting the sites, having them transferred and putting plans in place to develop them. The smaller sites have been used first. At the end of 2019, there were approximately 100. That has increased to well over 200. Very quickly next year up to 900 will be delivered, so delivery in respect of those sites is accelerating.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Several sites are very large. We need to get them properly planned to get a proper mix of housing and the right types of housing. It is not just about the mix, but also about having one-, two- or three-bedroom homes, and we need to make sure they are developed properly. The larger sites in particular take a good number of years to be taken through. The one thing we do not want to do is underutilise sites that we paid a lot of money for. They are coming through and the Deputy will see a very rapid acceleration in the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">The point about the mix echoes a point I previously raised regarding the range of policy measures. As a former local authority member, I have some experience of how it can be really difficult delivering a mix on big sites. Can Mr. O'Connor answer the criticism of why it has not proved possible to deliver on so many of the sites transferred to the Housing Agency? I think 37 were categorised as unlikely to be suitable for near-term development. I realise I am asking Mr. O'Connor to second-guess the local authorities' decision but why were the latter purchasing lands that had huge debts attaching to them, which the State was then forced to take over under the land aggregation scheme, and that are not deemed suitable? Will we see some of those lands handed back to local authorities for parks or other purposes?</p>

Another group of sites from those secondary sites is being developed. We went out to the local authorities and to approved housing bodies, in terms of the suitability of developing those sites. Ultimately, a small number may not be suitable for housing and other community uses may be more suitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">No, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report provides a very good overview of the land aggregation scheme. The 36 sites were identified for immediate development. What we did with the other sites was that we went to the local authorities and approved housing bodies and asked if any of the sites were suitable for the delivery of social or affordable housing? Both approved housing bodies and local authorities have identified several sites as being suitable. There are other sites that will take longer.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Let us focus on those other sites, because I have asked that question twice. I appreciate that the Housing Agency is dealing with issues decided outside its remit. Is it the case that there were sites bought by a local authority, because it wished to develop them, which had the potential to deliver 50% of the total estimate, that the Housing Agency asked was it interested and the local authorities said there was no demand? There is a massive issue where sites were purchased for housing, we are asking if local authorities wish to develop them and they are saying "No".</p>

In County Cork, there is a small piece of land in a village called Meelin where Cork County Council thought it had a need for a certain amount of social housing and purchased the site.

          <p eId="para_69">It is less a sense that these sites will not be developed but rather that the primary need is elsewhere. It is a completely valid and understandable question but I do not think it is necessarily as stark that these sites will not be developed on. They will be developed over time through a mix of the various delivery mechanisms whether approved housing bodies or local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The idea of low demand strikes me as a complete lack of ambition by many local authorities to solve the housing crisis. If it is not possible to do it in this decade when numbers were so difficult and if it was not possible to do it in the in the past decade for the same reason, I cannot imagine a time when they would be ambitious.

          <p eId="para_72">I wish to go through some of the sites that were purchased. In Goleen in west Cork, a lovely part of the country, €393,000 was paid for 0.82 ha. That is phenomenal money for west Cork. The second is Dripsey, where I come from myself, where over €500,000 was paid for 1.5 acres, which now has a value of €47,500. The third that really sticks out in my mind is the one for Sligo where €11 million was paid for 13 acres of land, the value of which is now estimated at €420,000. It sounds phenomenal that that kind of money was paid out without a clear plan for a reasonable period. This was before 2008, so more than 12 years have passed and none of that land has been used.

          <p eId="para_73">The whole country feels frustration about some of the decisions that were made at the time of the boom. It is very hard to rationalise them today when one looks at the types of numbers quoted by the Deputy. This particular scheme was to partially deal with the indebtedness in which some local authorities found themselves, to enable them to get on with their other important work. A range of controls is now in place to ensure that we do not do that again, such as controls on local authority borrowing, how sanction is delivered, and particularly around the strategic planning and area development plans within local authorities, in terms of where there will be housing and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Regarding that, I will go back to what my colleague referred to earlier, that is, the timeframe involved. In particular over the past four years major efforts have been made to build more local authority houses. The timeframe from when the local authority decides to build to getting the building completed is running now at nearly four years. Can we do something to try to change the process within the local authority? I refer to the time required from design, getting the project out to tender, getting the tenders in for the building and getting it completed. Surely the Department must have looked at a better way of delivering in a faster turnaround time. All of this land is pre-2008, yet in real terms a very small proportion of it has been built on.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Over the past four years we have done a huge amount in order to streamline the approval process for local authorities bringing forward building projects. We have worked on a 59-week target programme from conception to starting on site. That is a little over a year from concept to signing contracts and getting on site. That compares very favourably with the private sector. A report done by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, in 2017 shows that, on average, a housing project would take up to three years from start to completion. Since we worked with local authorities on that at the back end of 2017 and implemented it in 2018 we have seen good results in terms of meeting the 59-week programme and in many cases beating it.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> One of the very successful ways of beating it has been to use design and build contracts. We have supported local authorities in developing frameworks for that, which reduce the procurement period for the contract. Design and build also shifts the detailed design, post-planning, onto the contractor rather than the local authority. We have seen the four Dublin local authorities using it, and a number of other local authorities including Wicklow and Cork are in the process of adopting it now. The pre-construction programme is reduced. In one case we have seen a project go from conception to starting on site in 43 weeks and we have seen very good results in terms of construction on site with 30-unit and 40-unit projects being delivered within about a year. That is as good as any private sector delivery, and it beats it in many cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">Where does an estimate of the cost of building come in? When the tenders come in there is quite a big variation. There is a reluctance by the Department to respond in a timely manner. I have come across that on a number of occasions where there is an estimate of what the cost will be and then when the tender comes in it is way above the estimated cost. It appears that there is quite a delay in the process then to try and make a decision on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I would be very happy to look at specific projects but, in general, once the tendering process is over, the local authorities submit a tender report. The whole concept is to have the designs to a point where one can do an accurate estimate before tendering and then if something is way off, following the tendering process, it is worth looking to see where those problems are. I would say that is more the exception rather than the rule. If there are specific projects the Deputy wants to share with us, we can talk to him about them.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">I thank Ms Neary. I wish to go back to the sites which have now gone down in value. One of the sites in my area, in Dripsey, which is 1.5 acres, is now valued at €47,500.

In 2019, more than €800 million was spent on building activity. As we intensify the output of units that balance will continue to shift.

          <p eId="para_120">Generally speaking, when a lease-to-lease arrangement expires after a long period the family is back where they started. They have no guaranteed place to go. I could cite numerous incidents proving this. They are certainly not housed. The State has paid the lease for 25 years and has nothing to show for it. The family that was in the property has nothing to show for it. The cycle continues. This is a waste of public money. Can Ms Ryan find out the figure for lease-to-lease arrangements?</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> This is astounding. If the money given to private landlords and developers in the last decade was spent elsewhere we could have had the capacity to build tens of thousands of permanent public homes. The State would have housing stock to show for that. Despite this the policy continues. Looking at the figures for next year, it seems it will continue indefinitely. Given the amount of money that has been spent and what we could have had, unless one has rocks in one's head the only conclusion one can come to is that Rebuilding Ireland has failed, particularly where value for money is concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I believe we have had this conversation during the programme for Government. To my mind, over the past decade there has been a real and noticeable relaxation of building regulations. I have particular concerns, as Mr. O'Connor well knows, about the recent decisions on fire prevention in build-to-rent schemes, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> We take a risk-based approach to certification in the construction industry, which is valid in its own right, I suppose. It is, however, a model of certification which is based on the UK system, SIBC certification and all those kinds of things. It relies a lot on information from private providers. I assume the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been following the Grenfell reports and that a manufacturer there has actively misled a building control body. I am not suggesting that is what happened with pyrite, but will Mr O'Connor outline the recourse of the Department in those situations?</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I thank the witnesses for coming in today. I will focus initially on the performance-related piece of work by the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of delivering target setting. We all took the view that there should be strong transparency on which local authorities are performing well, and that they should be recognised for performing well. Equally, it is not clear to me exactly how that is measured and assessed or what constitutes performing well in terms of build and what does not. Will the witnesses talk me through how the Department assesses that? How does the Department deal with local authorities that are perceived not to be performing well on their build target?</p>

          <p eId="para_167">There are a number of ways, I suppose. There are a number of layers of assessment around the various programmes, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit, the work of other groupings and the targets we put out. I know the Comptroller and Auditor General's report focused very much on what goes into the Revised Estimates Volume each year. There are a wide range of statistics and pieces of information, and I have folders full of them here, on the various elements of delivery among various programmes that are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> I said earlier that my background is as a chartered accountant, so I am keen that we have strong performance indicators which allow us to measure. Some of the points in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are well made. We have significantly increased the number of indicators in the Revised Estimates Volume itself. We have gone from approximately nine indicators to 19 over recent years. We will add some more, a small number, because the timeframe is tight for the upcoming Revised Estimates Volume. Over the course of this year, we will work on improving the measures and linking them, most importantly to the spend, although as the Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged, that is complex.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">It is complex, and it is more multifaceted than that. Mr. Doyle has come into the Department, however, as a new Secretary General and has seen the work that has been done and the efforts to re-equip local authorities to build, in addition to the partnership arrangements they have for building. We have reams of briefing materials, which is helpful to a point, but if there is too much, it is almost unhelpful. Therefore, let us talk straight, as it were. What proportion of local authorities does Mr. Doyle think are delivering, or delivered as expected, in 2019 and might be expected, notwithstanding the difficulties of Covid-19, to deliver in 2020?</p>

          <p eId="para_173">Mr. Doyle has been there for a reasonable period as the Accounting Officer and has exceptional public service experience before that. He is well placed, therefore, and as he said, he is well placed as a chartered accountant to perform that sort of analytical task. Is it his view that the same local authorities are performing well and the same ones are not, or does he see it as a variable thing in his analysis to date?</p>

          <p eId="para_174">It is probably a variable thing. When a scheme is being launched on a particular day and somebody is cutting a ribbon on it, it is a moment where suddenly the local authority delivering that has done tremendously well. With any of these projects, we are talking about the delivery of infrastructure. I come from the transport side. The delivery of infrastructure does not happen overnight; it happens over a period. It is largely the same in housing.</p>

I appreciate Ms Ryan's point that the Department does not get involved if it is the authority's money but surely if we have ended up in a scenario where it is now coming from the public purse, there must be a change in policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I thank the witnesses for their attendance. I will return to an issue my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, raised. I refer to HAP and homeless HAP in particular. Some applicants who have been approved for HAP have had their payment reduced if they accepted a property with a particular approved housing body, AHB. In a recent incident, a single individual had been approved for the full amount and just by virtue of the AHB they were approved to be housed with, their payment was to be reduced. I do not know how that would happen. I do not expect the witnesses to know the intricacies of these issues, but is there a policy or a mechanism within the Department whereby one gets a reduced homeless HAP for certain AHBs? I would have thought it was standard right across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">Generally the AHBs are not engaged in the HAP market. There can be some unusual situations with moving from the capital assistance scheme, CAS, to HAP and top-ups with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to CAS and different arrangements where people accessing long-term rent supplements are transferring across to HAP. It is more to do with the differential in rent. We can look into any specific cases but there are no different treatments of tenants because they are homeless. If anything, there are additional supports available to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">That is what I would have thought. I am flushing that out because the Comptroller and Auditor General's report delves deeply into HAP expenditure. I would like to ensure there is no differential, particularly for people who are homeless. The assistance of the State must be there to ensure they have a roof over their heads. It took quite a bit of effort to get to the bottom of this case and the anxiety caused to the individual concerned is unacceptable. I might submit further correspondence to the Department to try to deal with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Deputy Verona Murphy alluded to the pyrite remediation scheme. I ask the witnesses to advise the committee on the progress made between the Housing Agency and HomeBond. I heard what the Chairman said about the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas committee on housing dealing with this issue. I ask the witnesses to update the committee on that work. The report makes note of the non-pyrite related damage.

          <p eId="para_225">With regard to non-pyrite defects, generally, defects are a matter for the contracting authorities and as much effort as possible should be made with them to work things out. In some cases, insurance is in place and that covers a certain amount of defects. The situation is fundamentally different when we go from pre-2014 to post-2014. I will address the pre-2014 situation first. A significant problem arose in Donegal and Mayo in respect of defective concrete block work. A report on that was done in 2016. Following that, the Government made a decision to create a grant scheme for both local authorities to administer for private housing affected by defective concrete blocks. Deputy Hourigan mentioned the Safe as Houses? report from 2017, which outlines an approach to general defects as well, in addition to the two about which we have spoken. The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine defective housing in a broader sense. Work on that has progressed. We are working on terms of reference and establishing a working group to examine that.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">With regard to the different measures and allocation of funding based on the local authorities' needs within specific regional areas, Mayo really concerns connection for domestic water use. I know the supports that are in place under improvements, refurbishment of private wells, etc., but it is critical that we start identifying the group water schemes that need to be connected to the public water supplies. There was a major issue regarding connection in Murrisk outside Westport. I would like some feedback on where this is in terms of funding and where works can commence. A number of communities in north Mayo - Carrowteigue, Sraith an tSeagail, Portacloy, Porturlin, Keenagh and Letterbrick - are all crying out for funding. The biggest challenge they face is that when they submit their application for funding to the local authorities, the cost of domestic connection per household is too high. We need to remove the roadblocks here.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> I know a working group was established in 2018 around the multiannual rural water programme and there were a number of recommendations that built into the 2019-21 programme but where do we move in 2021 and the next three-year cycle? People on the ground are receiving letters from the local authorities. One stated that the 2019-21 multiannual rural water programme allocation from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage had been received in October 2019 but the proposed community water connection did not receive any funding allocation and that the expert panel that assessed all of the multiannual rural water programme submissions considered that the unit cost was too expensive. These people are dealing with condemned water that they cannot drink. Their heating system cannot reach the required temperature. It is clogged with bog. If the Department has not visited some of these households, it would be a very good lesson for it to see the challenges they must face.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I would be very happy to come back to the Deputy on the specifics of that. Regarding the overall number about which the Deputy asked, I think the allocation was €47 million under the rural water programme last year. It was an underspend on the capital side and an overspend on the current side due to the projects out there. There is €49 million in on the 2020 number. We will give the Deputy those numbers but more specifically, we will come back to him because I know how important the work around these schemes is to rural communities. As I said, our water expert was here with us yesterday when we were dealing with the wider Vote but we will come back to the Deputy on each of those questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">It is really disappointing to see an underspend when there is significant demand out there. Local authorities do a tremendous job trying to get as many projects as possible across the line. People see TV ads where people are looking to donate €2 per week to supply a family with fresh water abroad but we have that challenge in Ireland. These people do not have domestic water that is fit for use, which is a crying shame. We are seen as a progressive country but many communities have been left behind in this regard and an action plan to address this as swiftly as possible needs to be put together by the Department.</p>

What is the annual payment? What period does €631 million cover?</p>

          <p eId="para_249">What period does €631 million cover? Ms Ryan has clarified that €631 million covers just under 1,000 homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> In terms of today's business, the pyrite remediation scheme on Old Knockmay Road was very good but painfully slow. The Part 8 process has received a lot of criticism but I know that, in general, a Part 8 can be dealt with in a matter of weeks, in other words, the planning permission was passed by councillors. However, there was a lot of toing and froing with the Department on minute details. The Department needs to give local authorities a bit of elbow room, particularly the good ones. Laois County Council has an ambitious housing programme and local authorities need to give a bit of space. I know that the Department must have oversight as a huge tranche of public money is being spent. This excellent scheme is a great example of one that came from the land aggregation scheme as it is built on that land. There is a lot of bureaucracy with the four stage process because a number of hurdles must be crossed at each stage. The scheme must be simplified down to two stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I wish to raise the issue of architect costs. We start with a blank canvas on each site but while we do not want Soviet-type blocks where everything looks exactly the same, surely we could have a more generic design model for a one, two and three-bed unit for a terraced or semi-detached house, or a stand-alone rural cottage, and for apartments? In 2003, the current system was brought in. Why start with a blank canvas each time? The only change is to the ground underneath. We need to reduce costs and bureaucracy because there is a huge amount of toing and froing between the design team and the local authority, between the local authority and the technical people in the Department and back again. Can we simplify the cost and timeline? Can we use a blueprint as a design for similar sized homes? There is a blueprint for most of what is designed. I am sure whoever designs the blueprint will be happy enough to get a royalty for each use. Can we do that? </p>

          <p eId="para_252">On the standardisation that the Chairman talks about, there has been quite a bit of work around that. Ms Neary and her team do quite a bit of on that.

          <p eId="para_253">There are probably three things that I should mention. In 2019 we published the employers' requirements document. That, for all intents and purposes, is like a standard specification for the quality of finishings on local authority housing. It gives a very clear understanding, for both the local authorities and us, of what is covered by the funding. It informs the design and gives a framework around the cost perspective in terms of briefing architects who are designing the scheme. That has created effective standardisation and consistency across the country in terms of social housing. It also provides guidance on costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I want the Department to go a step further. Why not use the same design on each site? There are different types of housing such as terraced, semi-detached and stand-alone rural cottages. Surely we could have a standardised design for the different types and sizes of homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The second initiative is the standard internal layouts. We discuss this a lot. The actual look and feel of an estate does need to fit within the context of the environment and community that it sits in. That is where the architects are very important in terms of appropriate designs. We have done a lot of work on the internal layouts. We are just about to share that with local authorities, in terms of a consultation period at the end of this year, so that there would be standard, economical layouts for one, two, three and four-bedroom houses and apartments. That is in motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">To save time and money the process needs to be streamlined in terms of greater standardisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> On the lag, while some of the sites were in areas where demand collapsed that demand how now increased. I could name a few sites but I will not waste the time of the committee. Borris-in-Ossory is one example where the situation has changed in the last four or five years. It changed from high demand to no demand and now there is demand again, which is being met by the county council. Some of the sites are zoned for the cost-rental model. Yesterday, at our meeting I cited some examples of people in the midland counties. If a family of four has an income of over €430 they cannot get on a waiting list for local authority housing. They need an income of between €900 or €1,000 net to get any kind of a loan, including the Rebuilding Ireland home loan. These people and their children are trapped for eternity in private rented accommodation without rent control and security of tenure. A labourer with a county council cannot get on the local authority housing waiting list, which is ridiculous. One of the effects is that there are whole estates with nobody or very few people working. Even some people on social welfare cannot get a local authority house. I have encountered a situation where two people on disability benefit could not get a local authority house. There is a huge number of families with one or two people working earning relatively low wages so they cannot get on the local authority housing waiting list, cannot get the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and are trapped in the middle. I have raised this issue with the former Minister, Deputy Murphy. I am overwhelmed with the number of people who have contacted me about this matter and I have no answer for them. The witnesses, as officials in the Department, and we, as politicians, must re-engineer the system to assist people. While a lot of them would like to be able to buy an affordable home, which would be great - and we need to get that scheme back up and running - the cost-rental model would give them security of tenure and a fair rent. Can this be pushed on some of these land aggregation scheme locations in terms of some of the vacant sites?</p>

          <p eId="para_258">I agree with the Chairman that the focus has been on delivery of social housing on those lands. Now with the reintroduction of affordable purchase housing and cost rental housing, we have those options on the site and we are pushing them. One example I showed there was in Stepaside and there are 50 cost rental units there. On the Devoy Barracks site in Naas, the requirements the Housing Agency, in conjunction with the Department, has set for that land is for a significant amount of cost rental and we are talking with-----</p>

          <p eId="para_261">We have to go beyond the Pale with this because this is a real issue. The real problem arising in more rural counties, such as counties Laois or Offaly, is that the threshold for social housing is very low. It starts at €480. It is €506 for a couple. Once a person's income is more than €506 he or she cannot get on a local authority housing waiting list and we do not have answers for such people. They are trapped for years. There are lands available. There are seven land aggregation scheme sites in County Laois, where they are transferred over into the NAMA for local authorities. They are there. Some of those sites are suitable. I also bring Mr. O'Connor's attention to a site being purchased by the local authority in Portlaoise, a substantial site on the Stradbally Road. There is potential there. I have raised it with the management of the council and am using the opportunity today to raise it with the various officials. We need cost rental on that. I spoke to the director of services and the county manager about this recently. Maybe Mr. Doyle and the Department can look at it. Here is an opportunity to do this model in a more rural county. It is a good site and a great chance to do it. Might he take that up?</p>

          <p eId="para_262">Yes, certainly. There is a wider context as well to that question. I know the Chairman is posing it in terms of LAGs and how we progress our affordability and cost rental schemes over the coming months. My colleague, Mr. Barry Quinlan, is leading our work on the affordability and cost rental piece, working on legislation and on the schemes, but there is a wider context to the Chairman's question and we are very cognisant of that.</p>

In the first instance it is a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board under section 13 to make proposals to the Minister either to amend, revoke or replace any part of the scheme. With Limerick, what would have happened was it took several years to establish the extent and severity of the damage to the dwellings and to confirm that the damage was actually attributable to pyritic heave in the hardcore. All sorts of investigations into the background and any other means of resourcing the remediation had to be exhausted before a proposal was made to the Minister. In the Deputy's example, that sort of a process would have to be followed in order for the board to be satisfied and then to make a submission to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Am I correct in saying that in 2015 an agreement was signed that set out the amount that would be owed by HomeBond? Is it now trying to renegotiate that figure? What is the issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_355">In regard to HomeBond, the overall cost is estimated at €210 million for the pyrite remediation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">HomeBond will finish up paying only a small percentage of that. The only amount received to date is €52,000. The overall cost or hit to the State is €210 million - that was the insurance cost. A "yes" or "no" answer will do to this. My recollection is that the type of insurance offered through the HomeBond scheme relating to pyrite was absolutely useless. It was of no benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">Does it cover pyrite and all other eventualities? Is the Housing Agency confident that the insurance provides adequate cover for homeowners and the taxpayer? The taxpayers had to go in and remediate a significant number of dodgy apartments and so on. Pyrite has been a major problem. Does Mr. O'Connor believe the taxpayer and home-purchasers are now adequately protected under the new terms?</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Yes, I think the insurance being offered now does adequately protect; it covers structural defects on properties adequately.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">That is the key issue here. We have been left with an appalling mess with pyrite. There were 29 applications from County Offaly. I presume they were all valid applications. How many of these are still outstanding? They are mainly from the Edenderry area.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">Will Mr. O'Connor come back to me with the amount? It is good that the scheme is rolling. That is the good news. Some of the slides shown earlier demonstrate the level of damage and what had to be done. We saw the situation these people finished up in with a mechanical digger in the sitting room five, ten or 15 years after buying a house and paying a mortgage. It is good that the scheme is rolling and that the pyrite board is getting on top of it. I am keen to acknowledge that. However, we need to ensure this kind of thing does not happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">We have discussed the figure of the public private partnerships. Public sector benchmarking is relevant. I understand the Department is not at liberty to make this available publicly. Will the Department look at providing the detail to the Committee of Public Accounts at a private meeting? We have to try to judge whether value for money is being secured. I am unsure whether the Comptroller and Auditor General has sight of this. If we are delivering houses through PPP schemes, the Committee of Public Accounts has to make a decision on whether there is value for money in terms of oversight and monitoring. We cannot do that if we do not have the figure for how the schemes are benchmarked with the public sector. That can be done in private session.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> I thank our witnesses, including Mr. Doyle, Ms Ryan, Mr. O'Connor and the witnesses who joined us remotely. We know Mr. Doyle is three months into the job and there is great complexity in it. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for assisting the committee in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Is it agreed that the clerk will seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from today's meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings on today's meeting? Agreed.</p>
