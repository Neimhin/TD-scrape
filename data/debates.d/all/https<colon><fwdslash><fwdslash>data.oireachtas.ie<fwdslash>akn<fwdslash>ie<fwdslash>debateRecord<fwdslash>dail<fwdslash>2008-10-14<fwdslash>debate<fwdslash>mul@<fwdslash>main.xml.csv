#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	0	What is happening here later today is really a costly side show to the main event, which is that, in the next few months, the Taoiseach's Government will screw down every taxpayer, small business and hard-working family in this country to pay for the wanton waste of his party in government over the past number of years.What explanation can the Taoiseach give for leading the country to this economic cliff face?  What explanation does he have for turning a €6 billion surplus into a €15 billion deficit in the space of two years and for the fact that, on published data, this country is now the only one in Europe in recession?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	——in that period.  Despite increasing the average industrial wage by €14,5000, the fact that we have reduced the tax take on those wages by €400 is an example of our pro-enterprise, pro-jobs and pro-investment policies which were far superior to those of any other member state of the European Union.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The particular issues affecting us now with regard to the downside risks that have come to pass, such as higher commodity prices and a global financial crisis, probably the worst we have seen since the 1930s, means an open economy such as ours cannot be immune from these developments.A particular issue on the domestic front also affects our performance, that is the reduction in residential housing output, which has a drag of approximately 4% on growth this year alone.  That in itself is a particular reason beyond what one can look to in other countries as being a reason for the present performance of our economy.  During that period, this economy also provided itself with the ability to reduce its debt considerably.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund represents another 14% of GNP, which is an asset to the country.While this year and next year we will face into a far more difficult set of circumstances, the purpose of the budget today will be to frame an objective where we seek to restore stability to our public finances and create a pathway back to current budget balance in time, recognising — I would not regard this as wanton waste — that we have had an unprecedented capital investment programme, practically all provided for from cash from surpluses in the past.We are talking about continuing with a very significant public capital programme for which we will borrow.  The return on the investment we saw from the last national development plan was in the region of 18%.  Borrowing for capital purposes is absolutely above board as far as I am concerned, despite the fact that in previous years we funded the investment from surpluses.Where we have an issue is with regard to the current budget deficit and the need to stabilise that situation and work back without cutting back unnecessarily on public services.  We must provide a balance in our budgetary strategy that recognises social welfare provision of approximately one third of current spending, public sector pay and a pensions bill of approximately one third of spending and the rest being spent on current day-to-day spending and the delivery of services in all other areas.  To find a balance will require further reforms and policy changes, the beginnings of which will be announced today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	11	With respect to the Taoiseach, the question I asked him was what explanation he has for turning a €6 billion surplus into a €15 billion deficit in two years.  What is his explanation for leading this country into recession?  As per the published data, we are the only country in Europe now in recession.There are the little matters of acceptance of responsibility and attachment of blame.  The Taoiseach never accepts responsibility for the actions of his Government.  He takes the credit but he will not take any blame.  The Taoiseach and his Government were responsible for building the largest ever property bubble in this country, the most indebted financial system, the greatest loss in competitiveness and the largest ever deterioration in public finances.It is not the global financial turmoil that is responsible for the fact that thousands of small businesses and shopkeepers cannot pay their water charges never mind their commercial rates.  It is not the global financial position that has caused the overcrowding in Drogheda hospital today.  It is not the global financial position that has caused such turmoil in education sectors where children are educated in overcrowded classes.  It is not the global financial turmoil that has caused us to have the highest government costs in the eurozone in transport, communications and energy.  This all boils down to the Government and its management, or mismanagement, of the economy, with these effects on the people.The Taoiseach will come to the House with the Minister for Finance, who is misfortunate, as he said, in being in this position at this time, and we are expected, after the softening up process over the past three weeks, to understand that the people's choice was to bring us to this point where in the next couple of hours we will have to listen to what many consider to be a financial Armageddon.  In respect of acceptance of responsibility and of some modicum of blame for what has happened here, is the Taoiseach big enough to accept that to put massive current spending programmes on the back of an unsustainable property bubble was a serious mistake?  Unfortunately, because of this the people will have to pay for it, left, right and centre, over the next nine months.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	59	What all this amounts to is that the Taoiseach wants to take credit for the good times and no responsibility for the recession.  The Taoiseach's and the Government's problem over the past several years is not, as they claim, that they did not see the recession coming, but they would not listen.  As recently as July 2007, the Taoiseach's predecessor told a conference in Bundoran that he did not know why people who engaged in cribbing and moaning about the economy did not commit suicide.  He described anyone who expressed any criticism of the Government's economic performance as a creeping Jesus.  The former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, described anybody who questioned what the Government was doing with tax breaks for property development and so on as left-wing pinkos.  He advised the country to party on.  The Government partied on and now there is a hangover.  It is payback time, but those who are being asked to pay back are the taxpayers.  The reality is that no other country has gone from our budgetary surpluses to the kind of deficits we have currently.  The Government, led by the Taoiseach, has walked this country into an economic recession and there is no point in trying to blame it on international circumstances.We know there are international factors, but the economic policies pursued by the Government contributed to the specific problem we have — particularly the over reliance on residential construction in recent years when everybody could see that it was not sustainable.  More and more air was blown into the balloon and eventually it burst, which is why we are where we are today.  Instead of the bluster we are getting from the Taoiseach and the kind of political slagging——

The second point is about the idea that I would not listen.  When a correction was needed in 2001 and 2002 we were told by the Opposition that we should battle on and not make any adjustments or corrections.  The Opposition was wrong on that because the economy bounced back far more quickly.  We did not listen either when the Opposition said that not alone were we spending too much, but we were not spending enough in a whole range of areas.  The Opposition cannot come in here now and suggest that they had a policy framework to ensure that none of this would ever happen.

I was the Minister who introduced that measure in response to the change that was coming in the property market.  The Opposition — before, during and since the last budget debate and certainly in the run up to the 2007 election — was saying that we should cut stamp duty by a greater amount so that we could raise prices.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The situation now is that, as a result of the hard landing that has come to the residential property market, it is imposing a fiscal drag of 4% on what would otherwise be a growing economy.  We have to deal with that situation now.  When people talk about the need for more housing, they have a lot to say about those who are involved in property markets, but that industry employed 250,000 people.  It grew from an industry of 120,000 people.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	90	What we must do now is off-set the reduced activity in residential housing.  This Government is bringing forward a substantial public capital programme next year and we will see an increased expenditure in our capital programme, for example, for education, in all of our efforts to find off-sets because of the reduced activity in residential housing, not to the extent that it will compensate adequately for the previous record level of activity because the demand is no longer there for that level of activity, but that level of activity was for many years, as we know, seeking to meet increased demand.  Supply could not meet demand for many years and that was the situation that prevailed.

I take it on with the same sense of duty as he would if he were in this position.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	94	It is the Government's job to manage what is happening in the economy.  We now have a very hard landing.  It has not come entirely as a surprise because everybody has known that there was going to be a landing of some kind at some stage.  For a number of years economists and commentators have been speculating on the prospect of whether we were going to have a soft landing.  It was his Government's job to manage the economic affairs of this country so there would be a soft landing, and he did not do that.On telling us what we said in 2000-01, I can go back further than that.  As far back as the late 1990s, when the property market was taking off, when house prices were shooting up and were moving way beyond the reach of working families to afford, the Labour Party put it to Government that what was happening in housing was not sustainable.  We argued, for example, for controls on the price of development land and on building land, all of which the Government rejected.  The Government continued to keep the party going, to keep it moving, to keep the speculation in building land, to keep the profiteering in housing, to keep driving house prices beyond what they were worth and what people could afford and, ultimately, it ended up driving residential construction way beyond what was needed or what was sustainable.  Two or three years ago, people could see what was happening.One looks around the country.  Was it sustainable to build suburban housing estates around the edges of villages?  It clearly was not.  Was it sustainable to build apartment blocks in places where there was never apartment living and would never be apartment living?  The only reason they were being built there was that the owners of them were able to benefit from section 23 relief and to carry that into other properties as well.

He is not taking responsibility for the consequences and for the people who must bear the pain and whose pockets will be rifled now to pay for what he did over the past number of years.  Frankly, I think the Taoiseach owes an apology to the Irish people for the way he has managed the country over the past number of years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I do not accept the characterisation that Deputy Gilmore puts on matters.  I have no intention of giving a history lesson.  We are looking here to the present and to the future, and that is certainly what we will be concentrating on in the coming days and weeks.However, for the purpose of not allowing statements to pass as if they should be passed for fact, the fact of the matter is, first, this economy is far more than simply a property issue.  We have a far more deepened, sophisticated and developed economy than was the case five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago, and we do ourselves a disservice by suggesting otherwise.Taking the point, that certainly it was true that up to 12% of output was coming from the construction and the construction-related sector, it related also to increased public investment.On private sector interests or people who built houses, the vagaries of the market will determine how they get on.  The Government did introduce Part V.  Section 23 relief was not available in every part of the country.  It was available in certain parts of the country since the early 1980s and we have seen major renewal in our towns and cities as a result.  There is now far more activity and they have been brought to life after the prolonged recession of the 1980s.  Those were the right policy decisions at the time and we have seen the benefits that resulted in terms of increased receipts, increased employment and increased investment.  There is no doubt about that.My point, however, is that, as Minister for Finance, I terminated those property reliefs on a planned basis to ensure we could move on to other areas of investment, be they research and development, technology, science or innovation, and serious amounts of taxpayers' money, generated from that increased level of activity, are now being provided in those new areas.  That is a far fairer perspective on the change in policy formulation there has been in this country to meet the new demands and requirements of the time and of the modern society and economy we have built.  That is the situation.To come back to the specific point raised, I am glad that people are being housed and that so many houses were built not only in the private sector, but also through the public programme.  I am also glad that we are bringing forward new, innovative ways to provide for those who depend on public housing through social and affordable housing initiatives from the voluntary sector, the Affordable Homes Partnership and local authorities.  I welcome all that development.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, introduced the Part V provision to ensure the public good was addressed in the context of development land prices.  That is what happened.What is relevant for the people listening to this debate is the question the Deputy asked today and to which I wish to reply.  Yes, there will be challenges facing us in the months and years ahead and there will be a requirement for everybody in the system to pay more than was the case previously.  That is true.  However, in relative terms after this budget and the next couple of budgets, as we face into this situation in the next year or two, we will ensure that we are still in a far better position than we were five or ten years ago.  The relative position, therefore, having increased the level of economic activity from one point to another, and even if it does not proceed in an incremental positive line now and even flatlines, is that we are still in a far better position now or in the year ahead than we were five or ten years ago when 600,000 fewer houses were built and 1 million fewer people were working in our country.

It is not a case of this economy suddenly becoming a bad economy.  It is facing difficulties and there are reasons for that.  I accept that some of them are domestic but others are international, from which we cannot be immune.  Ultimately, however, we can still get back to growth in the economy and build on those achievements on the basis of trying to provide as fair a budgetary policy as possible, which will be outlined by the Minister for Finance, as we begin that journey.  It will not be resolved today but we will begin that journey and find a pathway back to economic recovery on the basis of solid achievements which have not evaporated, despite the rhetoric of the Opposition.

There are six financial institutions included in the original guarantee and there are a number of others that have non-national parent bodies but have significant high-street operations in Ireland.  There may well be 11 different schemes — I do not know at present — but it is very important that the detail of the proposed scheme is circulated as quickly as possible so Members can put together a coherent response thereto and reflect on the questions that will arise therefrom.

First, can he tell us when the scheme will be circulated to the Opposition parties?  It is two weeks since the legislation was introduced and we would like to know that.  This is not something we can simply walk into on Friday without having had ample opportunity to consider it.  Second, what format will the debate take on Friday?  Will there be an opportunity for amendments to the scheme to be tabled?  Will there be an opportunity for the Minister to be questioned and for the details of the scheme to be fully teased through?  Third, have any changes been made to the scheme as originally envisaged arising from the meeting of the leaders of the eurozone countries at the weekend?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I will arrange for the scheme to be circulated to the spokespersons tomorrow so they will have plenty of detail before Friday.  As the Deputy will understand, the Department of Finance will be busy today with the budget, but we will arrange for it to be forwarded tomorrow.With regard to Deputy Gilmore's question on the parameters of the scheme, the basic scheme has not changed in any significant way from that which was forwarded to the European Union.  Obviously, on the question of the inclusion of other non-domiciled subsidiaries, the extra category has been included to satisfy requirements.  It was under consideration, as the Deputy knows, before we forwarded the draft scheme to Europe and, in any event, it would obviously be included there.  The scheme was worked through and a very constructive dialogue took place.  The basic parameters of the scheme are not different from what was indicated by the Minister for Finance during the passage of the legislation through the House with regard to its conditionality or scope.The scheme has got clearance from the Directorate General for Competition of the European Union under Commissioner Kroes.  I take this opportunity to thank her and her staff, as well as our own officials, the Attorney General and others who worked very hard in what is a complex area to have this scheme available to us absolutely as quickly as possible and in a way that meets European Union requirements.  On that basis, this is the scheme that has passed muster with the European Union in terms of meeting those requirements and, therefore, I could not envisage a situation where we would take amendments to the scheme and put at risk the compliance we have achieved as a result of the detailed technical and other discussions that took place.  We will put this by way of positive motion and I understand the Minister for Finance will be available in a question and answer session to clarify any aspect beyond the debate itself that Deputies would have in regard to the scheme.Deputy Kenny raised an important point, on which I wish to comment.  We took action a couple of weeks ago to give a full guarantee in respect of all deposits and liabilities in the banks.  We took a system-wide approach, which has been taken up by others since then.  What is under discussion in terms of the tool kit, in other words the range of options available, as decided at the eurozone meeting on Sunday, relates to a partial guarantee of debt, not a full guarantee.  It is not on all fours in that respect with what we did.  Recapitalisation is an option for those who want to take action in the future also.  I am pleased there is acceptance within the European Union of the action we took and the scheme now being passed by the European Union.  There is acceptance that the specific action we took was necessary in the circumstances we faced at the time.  We did what we believed was in the national interest to maintain the financial stability of the institutions in the State.It is important to point out that there are two ways of providing liquidity.  The problem as we know has been the question of wholesale inter-bank rates and the fact that money was not available in the system in the normal way in which business is conducted within the banking system.  Liquidity can be provided in several ways.  One way to provide it, which has succeeded in our case in the present situation — we cannot predict how all of this will evolve, as we still have not seen turbulence in the financial markets recede to normalcy yet — is to provide a full system-wide guarantee.  If other states want to provide liquidity in their circumstances by providing a partial guarantee together with a recapitalisation option, it is a matter for them.  It is totally within their remit and I respect what they see as the right thing to do in their circumstances.It is important to point out that although the Irish banking system has problems it is not susceptible to sub-prime debt, which was syndicated into other banking systems, including banks in other countries.  Those debts are coming to maturity now and as they do not have a value, they have to be marked down immediately, which perhaps brought about the requirement for immediate recapitalisation in those situations.  Irish banks are not in that situation.  The capital adequacy ratio of Irish banks is good and is well beyond the European Union requirement of 8%.  I understand it is in the region of 11%.  The capital base in Irish banks could be anything up to €242 billion.It is important that we make those points.  Every country has its own set of circumstances with which to deal.  The tool kit arrangement in respect of the European Union-wide scheme that has been agreed is not mandatory, time limited or time required for countries.  While the recapitalisation option can be valid in any country in certain circumstances, it increases the exposure of taxpayers in a way that the guarantee scheme does not, given that one does not have to put money up front or provide equity capital for the institutions.  Through the regulatory system that we are now devising for the guarantee scheme, there are many ways we can provide means by which we can assist capital being made available to the institutions from private sources, which the European Union scheme states is the preference in any event.While I have not ruled anything in or out — it is not good to speculate in these matters — I make the point that there are differentiations in terms of the Irish system.  As Deputy Kenny suggested, there has been some contention in the Irish discussion of the issue, that there is an immediate requirement for the Government to do something in respect of recapitalisation.  That is not the point since we have given a system-wide guarantee that has provided the necessary liquidity, and the time and space to see what way we envisage the Irish banking system develop from here.

The Taoiseach indicated that the detail of the outworking will be addressed by motion on Friday.  I presume amendments are acceptable if Members wish to table them and if this is not the case, can the Taoiseach clarify what exactly is the position?  Will we see a straight proposition that is either "aye" or "nay"?  Will we have the opportunity to make arguments or will they be disallowed because of the financial implications, as is so often the case in these matters?  Will the Taoiseach spell out the outworking of this for Friday's session?The Minister for Finance appealed to the various financial institutions to ensure that the full 0.5% decrease in the European Central Bank rate is passed on.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government will ensure that the lending institutions directly under its aegis, namely, the local authorities which are lenders and providers of house purchase loans to a significant body of borrowers, will do so?  Such people could not qualify for mortgages on the open, commercial market and are among those dependent on the lowest incomes. Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House that he is taking steps to ensure this is the case?Lastly, in the context of the ever deteriorating situation in the health services in the north east, is there——

We do not wish to put this at risk.  Even with the most honourable of intentions, people putting and taking amendments could lead to them going back and finding there is another problem.  The priority accorded by the House last week was to get the scheme to the House as quickly as possible.  This has now been done and because of the budget today and the European Council meeting in Brussels tomorrow, we will have it in the House on Friday.  We need to get it passed and to ensure it is in compliance with the law and we need to get on with the work.  Obviously, discussing it in the House provides an opportunity for people to make their views known and ask whatever questions they wish of the Minister on its passing, not on its being changed, amended and referred back.  With respect, we do not have that luxury.On the question regarding local authorities, such loans are specific.  They have the backing of the Government in any event.  There are fixed loans which remain fixed, and if there are variable loans which, under the terms are allowed to vary, then they take interest rate increases and interest rate decreases according as the market allows.

He may have clarified it in his last reply, but I wish to be absolutely sure of it.  Do I understand correctly that the Minister for Finance will respond to questions from Members of the House during the course of the debate on Friday?  That is my first question.  Second, this is a legislative Assembly in which Deputies decide what the laws of the country will be.  The Government motion that will come before the House on Friday is basically about making law in respect of the banking bail-out scheme.  I understand from what the Taoiseach has said that it is not open to the House to amend that proposed law because the Government has concluded negotiations with the EU Commission in respect of it.  I respectfully submit that the EU Commission has no legislative role in making laws for this country.

I do not understand the constitutional basis for the Taoiseach's comment that as the Government has, in effect, concluded an agreement with the EU Commission on the guarantee scheme, it is not open to this sovereign Parliament to amend the scheme when it comes before this House on Friday.  I would like the Taoiseach to respond to that point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	143	On the same issue, there is scope for further consideration by the Whips of the possibility of arranging a committee-style discussion on this issue.  People who might like to ask questions as part of such a debate might not get an opportunity to do so if the discussion were to be along the lines of a Second Stage debate.  I differ from Deputy Gilmore on this point.  As the legislation has been passed by the Dáil and the Seanad and signed by the President, it is now the law.  That Act of Parliament authorises the Government to introduce a scheme.  The scheme in question has received the approval of the European Commission.  Therefore, from a technical perspective, this House will be asked to accept or reject the scheme on Friday.  That is my understanding of it.  I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying that the Government does not intend, at this point, to put up borrowings from the taxpayer as capitalisation for any financial institution.

He was trying to reciprocate the accommodation he was receiving here.  He agreed to ensure that the scheme would come back to the House for its approval.  We will either approve it or we will not.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	148	No.  I am sorry.  The amendments were considered during the debate on the legislation.  We have had that debate.  The EU is not legislating for this House.  I am glad to say the EU has been accommodating in respect of the Irish requirements.  It has ensured that the scheme we have devised will enable us to put in place a State guarantee.  Such a guarantee is critical to the continuing liquidity of the Irish banking system, in difficult circumstances which have not gone away.  This House has a responsibility to bring certainty and clarity to that matter as quickly as possible, in line with the wish of this House expressed last week.  That is the situation.The motion to be considered by this House on Friday will relate to the scheme as approved and agreed by the Minister, on behalf of the Government, the Commissioner and the officials working on it.  The details of the scheme will be laid before the House as an act of further accountability.  Under the legislation that was passed last week, the Minister is authorised to devise and conclude such a scheme.  That is all provided for.  There is a legal basis for all of this.  Detailed arrangements for how the debate will be conducted can be worked out.  It is obvious that people will give their views on the scheme, in the first instance.  In an effort to be accommodating, the Minister is making himself available for a question and answer session.  He will listen to everyone's point of view.  We will have from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday to go through it.  That is eminently sensible and fair.

Such a Bill is urgently needed in view of the outstanding applications for offshore wind energy developments.  I understand that approximately €6 billion is waiting to be invested.  According to the legislative programme that has been circulated by the Government Chief Whip, the legislation is not expected for a number of months, if not years.  We will lose the investment I mentioned if the Bill is not introduced soon.

I assure him that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is concerned to deal with the legal complexities in relation to foreshore matters.  He is trying to develop a modern statutory framework that meets the business requirements of the sustainable energy industry.  The Deputy will agree that the Minister has a particular interest in that industry.  He is doing all he can to draft that legislation and subsequently to introduce it.  I understand it might not be introduced this year.  Hopefully it will be introduced in the new year.

I assume the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we do not have further scandals in this regard.  We are aware that some unethical members of the medical profession retained organs during post mortem examinations without the consent of the victims of the deceased.  Can the Taoiseach advise the House of the reason for the delay with the Bill?  Why is it not listed as a priority?  When will it be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	155	As the Deputy knows, the Department of Health and Children has a large legislative workload.  The House has been awaiting the introduction of the fair deal scheme, which is a matter of priority, for some time.  The heads of the Bill referred to by the Deputy were agreed last month.  It is obvious that work is continuing on the detailed drafting of the Bill.  I cannot give a date for when it will be taken.  I cannot say what level of priority is being given to it at the moment.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	160	A directive is normally issued by the European Commission before being transposed into law, with amendments, by the parliament of each member state.  In this case, the scheme has been agreed by the Government and the Commission.  It will come before this House for the first time on Friday.  Surely the principle that applies when directives are being transposed — this House has the power to make adjustments according to Ireland's needs as a member state — should apply in this instance.  That is what happens right across the board, in the case of all legislation that comes from the Commission to member states.  I ask for clarification in that regard.My second point relates to the Taoiseach, who is attending a European Council meeting for the first time in Brussels tomorrow.  He will set out Ireland's proposals in the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty referendum earlier this year.  It would be too much to expect to be given a preview of those proposals at this stage.  Can he give us some idea of the thrust of the remarks he will make to the Heads of State tomorrow?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	163	As I said earlier in response to Deputy Costello's party leader, a motion relating to the guarantee scheme will be proposed for the approval of the House later this week.  The motion is being introduced on foot of an amendment to primary legislation that was passed in the House recently.  In light of the importance of the matter, and the need to bring clarity and certainty to the issue, the motion needs to be taken on Friday without further amendment.  I would have thought we should not jeopardise the approval we have received from the European Commission by amending the scheme at this stage.  I am giving an undertaking that the parameters of the scheme are broadly in line with what we discussed during the debate on the legislation and will further discuss on Friday.  Everyone will have ample opportunity to ask whatever questions they wish about the scheme.  Deputies will be able to decide whether they wish to vote for its approval.The Deputy also asked about tomorrow's European Council meeting.  It will be my second time to attend such a meeting as Taoiseach.  As I agreed to do at the Council meeting in June, I will furnish a progress report on the aftermath of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty referring to the fact that a parliamentary committee has been set up that will report before the December Council meeting on how it sees things proceeding.  The Government will also engage with the French Presidency.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	176	We find ourselves in one of the most difficult and uncertain times in living memory.  Turmoil in the financial markets and steep increases in commodity prices have put enormous pressures on economies throughout the world.  Here at home we face the most challenging fiscal and economic position in a generation.This budget sets out a plan to deal with this most unfavourable set of circumstances.  The aim is to restore order and stability in the public finances, to increase productivity and competitiveness and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society.This budget seeks to secure the real gains we have made in the last 15 years.  These gains have been substantial: 2 million at work, real improvements in living standards, a more generous welfare system and the biggest public investment programme in the history of the State.  All these advances were made in the context of sound public finances and record levels of economic growth, but the economic context has changed very dramatically and with great rapidity.  We are confronted with severe budgetary pressures and negative economic growth.  We face difficult choices.  In making those choices we will be guided by the principles of fairness, sustainability and affordability.  By the decision to bring the budget forward by two months, the Government has seized the initiative and provided political leadership in this time of changed economic realities.Today I am setting out targets for the next three years.  In that timeframe, we must take the necessary steps to bring order to the public finances.Some 50 years ago, Seán Lemass set his generation the task of consolidating the economic foundations of our political independence.  Our economic achievements, particularly during the past 20 years, have fulfilled his vision.  However, the historical task facing us today is to consolidate and build on that economic success.  We will do this through sustainable, progressive and balanced policies that will create a fairer, more productive and competitive Ireland.CHANGED ECONOMIC REALITIESIn his Budget Statement last December, my predecessor — now Taoiseach — referred to the significant uncertainty in the international economic environment as well as the slowdown in our construction industry.  Nobody foresaw the speed with which the global and the domestic downturn would gather pace.  In the past few months, the world financial system has been turned upside down.  Household names in global finance have been rescued by governments and blue chip companies have either failed or been subsumed into other entities.A fortnight ago, when the stability of our own banking sector came under threat, the Government took bold and decisive action.  On the advice of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, we put in place a guarantee arrangement to safeguard the financial system in Ireland.  We did so to protect our economy, as well as those who work in it, and we are grateful for the support of the House in that endeavour.As a small open economy, we are especially vulnerable to economic shocks beyond our shores.  The international credit crisis has compounded and deepened the downturn in the construction sector and led to a fall off in consumer confidence.  The rapidity and severity of this downturn has taken even the most pessimistic of commentators by surprise.  The result is a sharp rise in unemployment and a steep decline in revenue, with businesses experiencing the kind of economic difficulties we have not seen in this country for over 20 years, although we are now in a better position to address those difficulties.The most recent data show that economic activity contracted in the first two quarters of this year.  My Department expects that GNP will decline by over 1.5% this year, the first decline since the early 1980s.  Throughout the world, economic forecasts have been revised downwards.  The prospects in our main trading partners remain poor.  In this context the forecast of my Department is that GNP will contract next year by 1%, with GDP contracting by about0.75%; unemployment will continue to rise, averaging 7.3% for the year as a whole; and inflation will ease to 2.5% on average for the year.We must remind ourselves that, even in this global downturn, Ireland continues to attract a disproportionate amount of all foreign direct investment into the EU.  Scarcely a week goes by without an announcement of new investment in cutting-edge companies and new high-value jobs for our graduates.  IDA Ireland is optimistic regarding the prospects in the year ahead.  The Government is determined to retain and enhance Ireland's reputation as a pro-enterprise economy and as an attractive location for foreign direct investment.  The most important action we can take is to stabilise our public finances.ORDER AND STABILITY IN PUBLIC FINANCESFiscal responsibility has been the cornerstone of our economic success.  Fiscal responsibility has ensured a modest national debt burden, a strengthened ability to deal with the financial and economic crisis now shaking the world economy and a credible tax regime which incentivises work and investment.While the strength of the economy in the past decade has given us some room for manoeuvre, we cannot put our reputation for fiscal responsibility in jeopardy.  We must take the right decisions now to put the budgetary position on a path to stability in the interests of everybody who lives and works in this country.  A soft option of ignoring the budgetary challenge might prove popular in the short term.  This soft option would have grave consequences for the future of the country.  It would risk all the economic and social advances we have secured in recent years.In framing this budget, the Government faced a deficit of the order of approximately 8% of GDP on the general Government balance unless decisive action was taken.  As the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure shows, we have, as a Government, reprioritised our spending focus.  The opening position this afternoon is a reduction in the deficit to 7% of GDP.  This is a significant adjustment.  Our approach has been to reduce public expenditure as much as possible on the current side and as much as is sensible on the capital side.The changes I am announcing in this budget build on those decisions.  This budget will adjust the incidence and focus of taxation to those better able to contribute.  It will also provide a social welfare package of €515 million.  As a result of these budgetary adjustments, the deficit will be approximately 6.5% of GDP in 2009.  This is the maximum reduction that we can achieve in 2009.  Our intention is to reduce it further.Our spending will be concentrated on our schools, on our health services and on the protection of the elderly and the most vulnerable.  We will continue to invest in our public services but, in a time of scarcer resources, the value for money principle becomes all the more imperative.A substantial increase in borrowing is unavoidable if we are to minimise the impact of the tighter fiscal position on the economy.  Accordingly, the 2009 budgetary targets are as follows: an increase in gross voted spending of 1.8%, a current budget deficit of just over €4.7 billion, a capital budget deficit of just under €8.7 billion, a general Government deficit of just over €12 billion or 6.5% of GDP and a debt to GDP ratio of 43%.It is my intention to secure a progressive reduction in the deficit as a percentage of GDP in 2010 and 2011.  The time for corrective action is now.  By moving to restore stability, we will ensure the economy stands ready to benefit from the next global upturn.  We are a small nation facing a major challenge in these uncertain times.  We must all pull together if we are to return to more prosperous times.In July the Government announced that Ministers and other senior public servants would forego pending pay increases recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.  I wish to advise the House that members of the Government and Ministers of State will surrender 10% of their current total pay.  Officers at Secretary General level in Government Departments have volunteered to make a corresponding surrender in respect of their pay.  Other public servants in leadership and senior positions may wish to consider whether it is appropriate for them to make a similar move in current circumstances.The Government has also decided to introduce an income levy at the rate of 1% on all incomes up to €1,925 per week or just over €100,000 per annum and at the rate of 2% on the balance of all income above that level.  We realise the solidarity it demands of all taxpayers.  However, there is too much at stake and we all have too much to lose by not taking action now.  The levy will allow all income earners to contribute in a proportionate manner to the restoration of order and stability to the public finances.  This will enable Ireland to return as soon as possible to a natural level of economic growth.  The levy will be kept under review in the light of economic conditions.I am conducting a review of the National Pension Reserve Fund in the context of recent economic and fiscal developments.  It is my intention to complete this review before the end of the year.  Any changes requiring legislation will be brought forward in due course.CURRENT GOVERNMENT SPENDINGGeneral PolicyIn the past ten years there has been a big increase in the public services financed by taxation.  Day-to-day expenditure rose by 200% between 1998 and 2008.  Spending on health has risen by 293%.  Education spending has increased by 174% and that on social welfare by 200%.  Successive Ministers ensured the public received higher quality and more extensive public services.  However, public spending can only increase in line with available resources.We must continue on a path of bringing spending into line with resources.  There is no option.  However, in so doing, the Government is determined to safeguard key public services, protect the vulnerable, refocus spending to enhance our productive capacity, regain export competitiveness, reskill our labour force, retain the substantial gains already made and continue our work in building a fairer Ireland.  This means doing more with existing resources, paring down administration to focus squarely on delivery of services to the public and reprioritising our spending goals.That is why my predecessor announced an efficiency review of all public service spending in last year's budget.  In July of this year, I implemented the findings of that initiative and other specific measures agreed by Government with the intention of achieving overall savings of €440 million this year and €1 billion in 2009.  This is a first step towards addressing the emerging difficult fiscal position.  These savings included a 3% cut in the public service payroll, a halving of expenditure on areas like advertising, public relations and consultancy and major savings from procurement reform.This initiative was just the beginning of the process but it sent a strong signal of our firm intention to tackle the emerging fiscal difficulties.I am pleased to report that those savings have been achieved and that the payroll reduction intended to deliver €190 million will in fact yield savings of €260 million.  The savings achieved have already been used to relieve pressures in areas such as health, where additional provision had to be set aside to meet the costs of a new consultants' contract and education, where the full year salary costs of about two thousand extra teachers and special needs assistants taken on this year had to be provided.Despite the challenging fiscal context, the Government will make significant allocations to social welfare, education and health.  The Government has agreed that gross current spending in 2009 will grow by no more than 3.6%.  Within this overall figure, spending on social welfare will grow by 8.4% to €19.6 billion; education will see an increase of 2.7% to €8.7 billion; and spending on health will increase by 2.1% to €15.8 billion.To accommodate these increases, gross current spending in other areas will require substantial reductions.  The individual allocations for each Vote for current spending are set out in the budget documentation published today, together with the main policy changes they require.Welfare/Protecting the VulnerableSocial Welfare Rate IncreasesWe are determined to protect the most vulnerable in our society and we will redirect resources to that end.PensionsI am happy to announce that the full personal rate of the State pension will be increased by €7 per week for all pensioners.  This will bring the State contributory pension to €230.30 per week and the State non-contributory pension to €219 per week.

Universal entitlements irrespective of means do not target those in greatest need.  In some cases there is a need to differentiate between those who have and those who have not.  I am proposing in the budget this year to initiate action in this direction in some areas and to promote a wider debate in others.The Government has decided to abolish the automatic entitlement to a medical card for those over 70 who are above the eligibility criteria.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The task force on the public service established by the Taoiseach has been preparing an action plan for the public service and its recommendations will be considered by the Government in November.In regard to public service pay and numbers, we must do more with less.  Pay rates are a function of agreed negotiations.  Our public servants, including teachers, doctors and nurses, often of the highest calibre, enjoy very favourable pay and working conditions by international standards.  As economic conditions worsen, those enjoying protected status need to contribute in a broader sense to the greater good of the wider economy.  Payroll costs are a function of staff numbers.  One of the most limiting factors I have found in my short time as a Minister is the lack of flexibility in re-allocating staff resources to the areas of greatest need.  This has to change.  We can no longer afford the increases in numbers we have seen in the past decade.  Where there are clear staff surpluses in certain areas, or where policy priorities change, staff numbers must be correspondingly reduced or reassigned.

The Government has decided that a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced for the HSE and discussions are under way on the development of such a scheme.  This will initially be targeted at surplus middle management and administrative staff, but may be extended to other surplus staff.Indeed, I believe it is essential to extend such schemes, in a targeted manner, to other areas of the public service where surplus staff are identified.  In this context, the Government has decided to conduct a focused review of public sector numbers in all branches of Government to assess whether the resources are being fully deployed in an efficient and effective manner and what economies can be made.  This decision will be implemented in November when the report of the task force on the public service is received.Our approach to public spending requires a systematic change in the way we do business.  It is not just a one year phenomenon.  It will have to be pursued and consolidated each year.  We need to look at public spending on the basis of priorities set by Government.  There can be no separate agendas or public bodies seeking to protect their turf.  All of us must work collectively to secure the public good.State Agency RationalisationThe Government has decided to reduce the number of State bodies and agencies by 41 and to streamline certain other functions.  It has also been decided to reduce the number of Army barracks to bring it more into line with operational requirements of the Defence Forces and to permit economies of scale.

Over the past decade, our rate of investment in public capital projects has been more than 5% of gross national product — double the rate of most EU member states.  In our new financial position, we have to be much more targeted in our investments.  We need to concentrate on capital projects that add significantly to our productive capacity and promote employment.  We have to secure maximum value for money and to consider less costly spending alternatives where possible.  Our plans remain ambitious but we will have to be more patient in achieving them.Gross capital spending next year will amount to more than 5% of projected GNP in 2009, or €8.2 billion in absolute terms.  We will seek to maintain this rate of investment in 2010 and 2011.  If the quantity of investment is less than planned, we are determined that its quality will more than compensate in value to the wider economy.

We have allocated €179 million to Science Foundation Ireland in 2009, up from €172 million this year, while Enterprise Science Technology Innovation will receive a 2.5% year on year increase, bringing it to €127 million in 2009.Ireland must continue to compete aggressively for overseas investment while supporting the indigenous sector.  Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will be well placed in the coming year to ensure that export-led growth continues to underpin economic revival.  The Government will continue to promote research and development, innovation and commercialisation by private enterprise.School BuildingThis year we will invest €810 million in capital projects for education.  Next year I will provide €889 million — an increase of €79 million.

This extension will assist purchasers who wish to become homeowners but who are, at this time, unable to obtain loan finance.  This will be a targeted and temporary initiative.  Funding will be provided by the Housing Finance Agency and it will be operated by a small number of local authorities acting on a regional basis.Second, we have decided to introduce a single Government equity initiative to replace a range of existing schemes which have developed in recent years.  Under this initiative the Government will assist those seeking affordable housing by taking an equity share in such houses.  This proposal will simplify the delivery of affordable homes.The full details of these changes will be announced by my ministerial colleagues with responsibility for housing.Climate Change PolicyClimate change is a critical issue for this Government.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Based on the latest available data our greenhouse gas emissions were an estimated 70 million tonnes.  We are committed to reducing our emissions to an annual average of 63 million tonnes over the period 2008 to 2012.  The EPA has projected that, based on measures already taken and those already planned, the annual average emissions will now be higher than previously claimed.  In the budget last year we introduced significant changes to begin the process of moving to a lower carbon intensive economy.  This year we intend to build on those steps.We must learn to use energy more efficiently.  The Government can play a role in improving energy efficiency in our homes.  To that end we are providing additional funding for a number of measures.  We will allocate €20 million for the home energy saving scheme in 2009, an increase of €15 million on 2008.  This will provide grants of up to 30% of the cost of retrofitting homes.  This scheme will increase energy efficiency and lead to carbon savings.This scheme complements the warmer homes scheme which provides insulation and energy advice to households in receipt of various social welfare benefits.  The Exchequer will provide €5 million for this scheme in 2009 and this will be supplemented by funds from industry.  We are also introducing a new scheme to examine the potential for energy savings in local authority housing stock through the retrofitting of older heating systems with new green energies.There are several taxation measures in this area also and I will deal with them shortly.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will deal with climate change policy in more detail in his carbon budget which he will present to the House tomorrow.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	229	We have been successful in building and maintaining strong economic growth for more than a decade.  While a range of factors have contributed to this success, the ability of the tax system to adapt and respond to the changing needs and pressures of a globalised economy has played a significant part.As we go forward, our tax system will need to evolve and change to align with ever more changing political, economic, environmental and fiscal conditions.  Globalisation and ageing are challenges that require us to think about the way we raise tax in the future.  Aging increases pensions and health-related expenditures while globalisation means tax bases are more mobile — an unhealthy combination of increasing costs and revenue risk.  The Commission on Taxation will inform our strategic thinking about the nature and burden of taxation for the next ten to 20 years.We have a low tax burden by European standards.  As a country, we have made a choice to reward work and enterprise.  It has to be recognised that we demand ever more ambitious public services.  We have an aging population and at the same time more modest rates of economic growth in the future are anticipated.  This means that less money will be available to meet public expenditure demands.  This has implications for our tax system in the long run.  In the next year, close to €2 billion in tax revenue must be raised to keep within the fiscal targets set out earlier.  If the current economic circumstances deteriorate, it may be necessary to make some equally difficult tax choices next year.Principles of Taxation€2 billion is a very substantial amount of money to seek in any one year, but circumstances are such that there is no option.   In raising this sum, the Government has been guided by three essential principles.  First, the imposition must be fair and equitable and at a higher rate for those on higher incomes; second, the levies involved must be straightforward and readily collectible and third, we must seek to protect sustainable production, employment and the economy to keep Ireland competitive in the global marketplace.  The Government is concerned that some of the more expensive tax reliefs, especially for the better-off, should be scaled back and the resources used, as appropriate, to protect those taxpayers who are most vulnerable in these times.  It is fair and reasonable that those who profited most from the recent good economic times should shoulder a commensurate burden as conditions worsen.Main Tax MeasuresEarlier I indicated the Government has decided to introduce an income levy at the rate of 1% on all incomes up to just over €100,000 per annum and at the rate of 2% on the balance of all income above that level.  Apart from this the main tax measures are as follows.VAT/ExciseI am increasing the standard rate of VAT by 0.5% to 21.5% from 1 December.

Further details are contained in the summary of budget measures.DIRTThere will be a new rate of DIRT of 23% on ordinary deposit accounts and 26% on certain other savings products which will raise €85 million in 2009.Income TaxI will increase the standard rate tax band by €1,000 for a single person and €2,000 for a married two earner couple to help maintain its real value and to ensure the maximum possible number of taxpayers continue to pay tax at the standard rate of 20%.  This will cost €200 million in a full year.Mortgage Interest ReliefIn relation to mortgage interest relief, from 1 January 2009, the rate of tax relief for first-time buyers will be increased from 20% to 25% in years one and two of the mortgage and to 22.5% in years three, four and five.  This change will benefit first-time buyers who purchased since 1 January 2005.  The rate for years six and seven will remain at 20%.  First-time buyers relief ends after year seven.  To fund this change, the relief for non-first time buyers will be reduced from 20% to 15%.  This rebalancing makes for a fairer system and helps those buyers with the biggest financial exposure and those facing falling property values.  Circumstances can change of course and this rating structure is not set in stone.  It is very much tailored to current market conditions.TAXATION MEASURES TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC CONFIDENCEBusiness Taxation — Keeping Ireland Competitive in a Global EconomySuccessive Governments since the 1950s have recognised the importance of a corporation tax regime which incentivises investment and employment in key economic sectors.  The past 20 years have seen Ireland become a major centre in the areas of technology, pharmaceuticals and financial services to name but three.The 21st century economy is now mobile, globalised and increasingly knowledge-based.  As a nation, we have to ensure that we are a location of choice for foreign direct investment and one in which indigenous industry is able to prosper.  We became a global player in manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s and this decade has shown that we can adapt and attract global players to Ireland and build local competencies alongside them.  We have managed to build indigenous global players as well.The 12.5% rate of corporation tax is an important element in our taxation system.  It has been a cornerstone of our industrial development in the past decade.  I emphasise that this rate of tax is not for changing upwards and it will continue to be a central part of Ireland's economic brand.  Ireland's economic prospects are dependent on a vibrant and modern business base and I know that virtually all sides of this house will agree with me that our rate of corporation tax is essential to this.The Government is convinced it is important, despite the need to secure a substantial increase in tax, to maintain and enhance pro-employment business tax reliefs.  As an economy we are open to new business and new investment.  I am bringing forward a number of measures to support jobs, encourage enterprise and enhance our productive capacity.R&D Tax CreditThe R&D tax credit available to companies will increase from 20% to 25% putting it to the forefront of R&D regimes globally.  This will increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location for R&D activity and it will provide a well-targeted stimulus for such value-added activities.  I will consider making further enhancements in the forthcoming Finance Bill.Intellectual PropertyIntellectual property has become important globally in recent years and we need to ensure that our tax regime fully reflects the changes which have taken place in this area.  If this sector can provide jobs and revenue to the State, I am willing to listen.  I have asked the Commission on Taxation to investigate options in this area and I plan to return to it in the future.New VenturesIn recognition of the challenges faced by new and start-up companies in these challenging economic times, I propose a remission in corporation tax and capital gains tax in their first three years of operation with certain limits.Corporation Tax DatesIt is important that all sections of the economy and community play their part in addressing the fiscal challenges.  Recognising the positive changes made in the corporate area, I propose to bring forward the payment dates for companies paying more than €200,000 corporation tax on their profits.  This will yield €350 million in 2009 on a once-off basis.  Details are in the summary of budget measures.Filing of Tax ReturnsEarlier this year I signed the order for mandatory electronic filing and payment of tax.  This is a modern, secure and easy method for the payment of taxes for business.  As a further pro-business measure, I propose to encourage take up of Revenue's online services by providing a general extension to existing deadlines where returns and payments are made via the online systems.Stamp Duty on ATMs and ChequesTo encourage greater use of electronic means of payment for commercial, financial and retail transactions, I propose to build on the initiative introduced in last year's budget by halving the stamp duty on combined ATM cards from €10 to €5.  To fund this measure, the stamp duty on cheques will be increased from 30 cent to 50 cent per cheque.  This important step will further encourage the use of electronic payment methods.  To promote the development of e-payments in the economy, which has the potential to yield significant competitive benefits, the Government will establish shortly a high-level group comprising representatives of the main stakeholders to direct the preparation and implementation of a national payments implementation plan over the next two years.Rebalancing Capital TaxesThe related areas of stamp duty on commercial properties and capital gains tax on such transactions are imbalanced and I propose to rectify this.  This imbalance does not apply to residential property because the principal private residence exemption means there is no capital gains liability in such cases.First, I am cutting the top rate of stamp duty on commercial property from 9% to 6%.

We need commercial development and investment if we are to create jobs and stimulate economic activity.  We must also give an impetus to the commercial property market.  This cut is my contribution.  The rate will stay at 6% and it will not go lower in the lifetime of the Government.Second, I am financing this measure through an increase of 2% in the capital gains tax rate.  This increase also mirrors the level of income levy being imposed on higher earners and it is equitable to match this levy increase effectively with an equivalent rise in the rate of capital gains tax.  I will continue to review the rate of capital gains tax on an ongoing basis.Third, I am bringing forward the payment date in 2009 for individuals paying capital gains tax.  This will generate €200 million in 2009 on a once-off basis.Farming TaxationFor the farming sector, I propose to extend for a further two years the farmers stock relief, farm pollution control relief and farm consolidation relief.The stamp duty relief for young trained farmers will be extended for a further four years to 2013.  The farmers' flat rate addition for VAT is being retained at 5.2% for 2009.

The report will assist the Government in assessing how such a levy might best be structured and implemented in a fair and consistent manner in the budget next year.  We must ensure that Ireland's economic prospects are protected and enhanced and that the most vulnerable do not lose out.  I look forward to making a firm announcement on the issue in my budget 2010 speech.Environmental Taxation MeasuresAs part of the Government's overall programme to support a sustainable environment, I propose to introduce a flat rate levy in the major urban areas of €200 where an employer provides car parking facilities for employees.  In addition, I propose a tax incentive to promote cycling to work.

I will also bring forward measures in the Finance Bill to relate benefit-in-kind on cars and mileage to CO2.  These measures, together with expenditure decisions and enhancement to capital allowances for energy efficient products for businesses will make a positive contribution to reducing Ireland's carbon emissions.I will also introduce a new tax incentive scheme to facilitate the relocation of Seveso-listed industrial facilities, which hinder the residential and commercial regeneration of docklands in urban areas.  The EU Seveso directive seeks to protect public safety by placing land-use restrictions on new residential and commercial development near locations where potentially dangerous activities are undertaken.  This scheme will be subject to clearance by the European Commission from a state aids perspective.Energy Efficiency in BusinessBuilding on the measures introduced this year, I will extend the range of energy efficient equipment purchased by companies that can qualify for accelerated capital allowances.  These will include energy efficient data server systems and, vital in these times of high energy costs, electricity provision equipment and control systems.Local Authority Charge on Non-Principal Private ResidencesDemand for Local Government services is increasing all the time.

The capital programme has been axed by €1,300 million, which is a cut of 11%.  This was a time when we needed investment for the long-term future.  The Minister has made decisions today that will threaten to turn a recession into a depression.

People awaiting home care packages have felt the brunt of cuts before this budget was even thought of, but the Minister has now turned the screw even further.  People talk about courageous decisions but this is not courage.  Courage is about taking a brave road — taking decisions that may make one unpopular in the short term, but which build something for the future.  These are not the decisions the Minister has made today.

The Minister has also cut the capital budget by €1.3 billion.  That is reducing activity in the economy.  Those are the decisions.When one looks to his current spending budgets, the Minister is still pushing ahead.  There is €2 billion extra on current spending, only a quarter of which is for social welfare.  He has pushed ahead with extra pay in the public service right across the board.There were alternatives.  We and many outside this House offered alternatives, but the Minister has taken the soft road.  He will not be forgiven for this budget.

The Minister is on course to double the national debt in less than four years.  This will be the legacy of Deputy Brian Lenihan's tenure in this post as Minister of Finance.Let us be quite blunt.  It is not the bankers in Zurich or the mortgage lenders in Detroit who have brought us to this sorry pass.  It is a Government that was cocky enough to claim credit for the good times and is not man enough to recognise its huge contribution to creating the property bubble and creating the difficulties that have plunged this economy into recession.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20302	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	295	For four years the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, had the opportunity to show courage, to embrace reform in the public service, to ensure that the public money we spent made a difference to people at the front line, and he refused to make that courageous decision.  He sat on his hands.  He allowed spending increase with no reform.  That is what we are paying for today.  That is why people are seeing borrowing at historic levels, huge increases in taxation and the most vulnerable being asked to chip in more.  That will not be forgiven either.It is a tragedy that, once again, a new generation is asked to mortgage its future to pay for the mistakes that Fianna Fáil has made in Government.  The culture of the Galway tent, the culture of spending when you have it is what has got us into this hole.  It has damaged the fundamentals of our economy and we will pay for it in the years ahead.Our problems today do not come from international difficulties.  They come from a Government that has sabotaged the capacity of this economy to withstand that storm which was inevitable.  Why is the mighty Celtic cruiser the first to hit the rocks in this recession, the first to see its public finances run into difficulties?  It is because the captain and the officers, who were on the deck and who we expected to look out for our interests, ignored the storm warnings, overloaded the vessel and neglected to maintain the engine, and now we are drifting towards the rocks.The reason is clear.  It is the way in which the Government pumped up public spending on the back of unsustainable revenues.  It is the way they allowed the property bubble to destroy our strong exporting economy.  It is the way they abandoned hard-learned habits of preventing waste in public spending.  That is why we are in this predicament.  It has nothing to do with the international factors.Even today, with everything obvious out there, the Government remains in denial about the underlying causes of the difficulties that we face.  While other countries have felt the force of the international shock waves, it is not they who are deep in recession.  It is not they who find their public finances turned upside down.  It is only Ireland that has seen that.  Where other governments, like the Spanish, in particular, took the courageous decisions to make changes, the Minister sat on his hands.Already we see the human casualties that have come from the Government's approach to managing the economy and to failing to prepare.  More than 80,000 people are already in the dole line, terrified for their future.  There are thousands of talented businesses turning to loyal workers telling them they must let them go, and they are fearful that soon they will have to shut the doors and call in the receiver.  There are hundreds of thousands of families struggling to pay mortgages on houses which will never see the value again that they paid for them, and they are sick with worry that it is their job that will be the next to go.  There are old people looking on today at the closure of hospital beds and the freezing of home-care packages, frightened that the services they need will not be there when they turn to look for them.The ultimate test of this budget is whether it has looked out for those families.  Has it avoided the soft options?  Has it protected the most vulnerable?  Has it made major structural changes in the public sector that will avoid waste?  Is it part of a wider plan to create a smarter economy?  The sad answer to all of those questions is "No".Let us remember the context against which this budget has come.  Since 2000, the Government increased current public spending by 140% or €32 billion — €20,000 extra for every family in the country.  They increased the numbers in the public service by 72,000, but they delivered little or none of the commitments they made to improve the quality of public services.They grew careless about how they spent money because they never really had to confront the taxpayer with the bill.  The explosion in tax revenues from the property boom filled the gap and they went on blissfully unaware of the reality of the wasteful spending they incurred.This bonanza in spending was not costless.  Someone did pay.  It was financed on the backs of hundreds of thousands of people who entered into 35-year mortgages and who now are struggling to pay that money.  They are carrying the can.  Young people have carried the can for Government waste.  These miraculous revenues that were flowing in were not from some goose laying the golden egg.  These were from real families who are now faced with the reality of a Government that did not manage the economy prudently.  They are the ones whose backsides are exposed now, who are facing the real dangers and the cold winds of this economy.Like the bankers so rightly now in the dock, this Government built long-term commitments on short-term revenues.  They threw caution to the four winds.  They put their self-interest ahead of their responsibilities.  The banks bailed out the developers.  The Government bailed out the banks.  Now the taxpayer is being asked to bail out the Government.  Who will bail out the taxpayer, that is what I want to know?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20302	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Today, again, the Government found the soft options irresistible.  Tax increases will crucify people on very modest incomes.  That is the tragedy of today.We will see the equivalent of a new 1% levy, both on the standard rate and on the top rate.  It will apply to everyone.  Even those exempt from tax will pay it.  This applies right across the board.  It is three tax increases rolled into one.  It is a direct hit on those at work with no allowance for the commitments they might have to family and to mortgage.  This is completely turning on its head equity in the tax code.It is a temporary measure.  Income tax was a temporary measure, I think, during the Boer War when it was introduced.  The insurance levy was a temporary measure when it came in 25 years ago, and it is still there.  I have little confidence that this is a temporary measure.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20302	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Today we see no increase in tax credits, the small payments that give a little relief to the people at the bottom.  There is no increase, not even for the personal credit, not for the home carer credit, not for the disabled child credit, not for the age exemption credit.  None of these people has got a cent in the budget's concessions.Even on indexation of the bands, the Minister offered only a little over half of indexation.  This means that every person in the country will have to face paying €292 more than they should had their taxes and bands been indexed.  That is the case for single people; it is double that for couples.The Minister is hitting ordinary people at their most vulnerable times.  He has decided to haul back the relief for people who have large medical expenses.  These are the people in nursing homes or people who have expensive illnesses.  They are being told they will no longer get relief at their marginal tax rate.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20302	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Again, this will hit families who are vulnerable.  I have carried out a simple calculation of how this budget affects families on €60,000 per annum.  God knows, that is not a great deal of money and those families will be eligible for affordable housing if the Minister's plan goes ahead.  These are very ordinary families struggling to get by, but today's budget amounts to €2,300 in extra taxes, charges and levies on those families.  That is the reality the Minister is presenting.  These families are trying to cope with child care and the difficulties of living in straitened times.We were told the Minister would be prudent in how he would invest scarce moneys.  Why did he remove €2.2 billion from the public capital programme?  He knocked over €1 billion from the State's contribution and €1 billion from the PPPs, which is a total of €2 billion.  That is inexplicable when one recalls the Minister saying, time and again, that the one thing the Government would protect was its investment in the capital programme.  Why has the Minister sacrificed €2 billion of it?  That appears totally perverse at this difficult time.The problem in this country is that there is a collapse of confidence in these Ministers to deliver value for money in the public service.  That is the legacy of this Government.  The annual catalogue of waste in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced no more than an indifferent shrug from the Government.  There is no resolve to change.  Deplorable decisions have got us into this hole.  Whether it was benchmarking, the birth of the HSE and how it was handled or the crass political handling of decentralisation, Ministers have failed time and again.  They failed to lead change in the public service because they do not work to professional standards themselves.  They are the first to break the rules when they wish to push through a pet project and they are the last to accept responsibility when something goes wrong.How can these Ministers be taken seriously?  Not one of them produced their statement of strategy on time, even though it is their legal obligation.  They do not bother to measure three quarters of the tasks they regard as priorities when producing the annual output statements.  Even last year, they only delivered a fraction of the commitments they undertook to deliver with the money we gave them.  These are not Ministers one can take seriously.  One will search in vain for radical reform in public service delivery in this budget.  We were told by Deputy Cowen when he assumed the position of Taoiseach that public service reform would be the hallmark of his regime.  It did not happen in the four years when he was in charge of the public service but that was to change.  However, there is no change today.There has been no change in the way budgets are put together.  Budgets are still dished out without Ministers being tied to any hard and fast performance targets.  Evaluations of major projects are still not published, even though taxpayers are expected to stump up the money for them.  We still have agencies that are not paid on a performance basis.  What is the result?  We see it daily.  It means that when the HSE runs out of money it closes down beds, instead of looking for more patients to come through so that money would be attached to those patients.  It simply closes down the beds and tells patients it has nothing for them.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20302	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	303	That is a ridiculous system but the Minister persists with it.  We have not seen in this budget the commitment to reform that is necessary.  The budget should have been a watershed and should have provided for real changes, whereby managers were held responsible, power was devolved, change was implemented and people were expected to reach high standards.  This was the opportunity to do it but, again, it has been fluffed.The vulnerable deserved a lot better than what they got today.  Even before today's budget was produced, the Government did not spare the most vulnerable in our community.  When the HSE's budget was running short during the summer it targeted the disabled and the old.  Programme improvements for them were withdrawn so the HSE could limp on unreformed.  When savings were required in July, where did the hand go?  It went for overseas development aid and the money that had been assigned for nursing homes.  It was all clawed back.  Again, it was the soft option of hitting people who are weak.Today we see more of it.  The accident and emergency service charge is increased by 51%, the hospital charge by 14%, the drugs refund charge by 11% and the long-stay charge by26%.  Who will these charges hit other than the people in our community who are sick and vulnerable?  However, these people only received a €7 increase in their social welfare payment.  That is not even indexation, it is 3% when inflation is running at 4.5%.  Their annual income has been cut in real terms and they are also being asked to stump up all these extra charges when they use these services.  I do not know who was with the Minister when he set the increase for the fuel allowance.  It is just €2 extra per week at a time when fuel prices have gone through the roof.  Older people who are dependent on poor fuel systems will suffer through this winter but there has been no consideration of their needs.There was also little consciousness of the 200,000 people who are at risk of losing their jobs under the new regime.  Where was the reform of the redundancy scheme to provide for immediate re-training or reform of the back to education scheme so people will not have to wait years before they get a chance to re-skill?  Where is the reform in the family income supplement to target it at people who really need it?  There has been no attempt to innovate, to think our way through or to create opportunities for people who are losing their jobs.  That is not good enough.  This budget has not been about innovation, change, hunting down waste and finding ways to help people who are vulnerable.  Instead, the soft option is always chosen.  That is the tragedy we are confronted with today.In the longer term our success depends on being a successful trading economy.  The gravest policy mistake in recent years by the Government has been to forget that this country stands or falls by its ability to export.  That is a tragedy, which will make it very difficult for us to pull through and recover from these difficult times.  There is nothing in today's budget that sets out the new programme for reform in the public sector organisations that hold that back.  Let us be honest.  Ireland is bottom of the league in terms of ports, airports, electricity costs, waste management costs and broadband.  Where is the innovation or the commitment to reform these to give our exporters a chance?It is worth recalling the contrast between the past four years and the years when the rainbow Government was in power, when Deputy Ruairí Quinn was Minister for Finance and I was Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  At that time the volume of exports was growing at 17%; now it has collapsed to just 6%.  Under that Government, productivity was growing at 8% per annum; now it has collapsed to just 2%.  Then, our market share increased by 25% in four years; this Government has cut it by 20% in four years.  That is something a small open economy cannot tolerate and survive and thrive.  That must change, but the start on that vital change was not made today.As a people, we have taken great pride in the creation of a new Ireland in the past two or three decades.  Families separated by emigration were reunited, young people leaving school were able to find good jobs in this country and towns and villages in danger of fading away returned to life.  We grew anxious in recent years when the pressures of working in an economy of runaway house prices, jumbo mortgages, poor transport and expensive child care gradually choked the quality of many people's lives.  However, people kept going and put their trust in Fianna Fáil, which promised it had everything under control.  Fianna Fáil said it had a strategy for health care, school buildings and smaller class sizes, which is now gone.  It had a strategy for spatial planning and climate change and it believed the property sector was based on sound economic fundamentals.  Those plans and strategies have all proven to be hollow shells.  When tested, they cracked and yielded little inside.  We now know the trust in Fianna Fáil was misplaced.  It was asleep at the wheel and had grown lazy and lethargic and increasingly incompetent.  The Fianna Fáil economic miracle has turned into a mirage.  The complacent Fianna Fáil message that it should be trusted on the grounds that it knows what it is doing is simply no longer holding up.Even today, with a  crisis on its doorstep, the Government has failed to grasp the profound changes that have affected our economic health and the far-reaching reforms that are called for.  It has made a bad situation worse.  The ordinary people will pay for its mistakes, not just today, which is clear, but in the future.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Today's performance by the Minister for Finance has really been like a Hallowe'en B movie.  For Fianna Fáil, it is really "Nightmare on Merrion Street" with mood music from the shower scene in "Psycho".This is a tough budget for middle-income and working families, just like the Government promised.  Middle-class and working families have not just taken a hit, they have been mugged by the Minister.  Whether we are referring to the income levy or the restriction in terms of health costs, we should make no mistake about the fact that the coping classes, the PAYE sector, are the Minister's main targets today.  While this budget will eat into the income of the average PAYE family, the ultra-wealthy, the tax exiles and those who made a killing from the Celtic tiger will suffer relatively little pain.  I noted how the Minister thought about them when he introduced the levy of €10 for people leaving the country but I noticed how he managed to exempt those friends of Fianna Fáil with private jets.  The levy does not apply to craft that carry fewer than 20 passengers.  If the girls want a weekend in New York, as people got used to in the Celtic tiger years, and want to avoid paying the €10, they had better talk to a friend with a private aircraft.The budget reeks of panic measures.  The Minister lacks a clear and coherent strategy for economic recovery in the medium term.  I worry about the quality of the figures in the budget.  No fewer than three very reputable commentators and economic firms indicated the Minister is overestimating the tax take for next year by up to €3 billion.  His plan is very limited and very reminiscent of the Haughey budgets of the early 1980s, during which era there was a broad indication that line Ministers would reduce costs by specific targets.  However, it never really happened.  It was not until Ray MacSharry became Minister for Finance some years later that there was real implementation of cutbacks in regard to targeted spending.The Minister should have delivered a recovery plan to put the 80,000 unemployed back to work, training or education.  On page B.15 of the Budget Statement, the Minister indicates eight very severe restrictions to entitlement to welfare payments.  This will mean that many people, who through no fault of their own are losing their jobs in the current economic climate, will be subject to many more restrictions and will have to wait many more weeks to receive a benefit.  When they receive it, their qualification period will be reduced.There is nothing in the budget to get the 80,000 on the dole back to work, education and training.  When I was in the Department of Social Welfare with the Minister's former ministerial colleague, Deputy Michael Woods, I introduced the back-to-work allowance and a series of other measures to get people off social welfare and back into employment.  This budget contains no such positive measures.What a bonfire of the vanities we have witnessed today.  Very little has been spared.  Into the bonfire goes the national development plan and many of our most ambitious plans for a proper transport system.  There is no mention of metro north, metro west or a train to Navan, but the roads programme has been kept.Into the bonfire goes the Fianna Fáil manifesto and all it promised.  Into the bonfire goes most of Fianna Fáil's commitments to a fair society and social justice.  One of the monuments to children and women that the Celtic tiger should have built — because we worked for it — was a proper child care and pre-school education system.  Instead, the Minister indicated that he really intends, in future budgets while the recession continues, to take the axe to child care and child benefit.  This represents a bad day for many women in Ireland, be they full-time carers of children in the home or working outside the home and trying to mix work with child care.  We should have built a pre-education and pre-school system because all of our competitors in Europe, whom we aspire to be like, have one.  We had the money during the boom but did not build it.The Government has driven the economy into the ditch.  Today we have the first full view of the wreckage and our first full opportunity to estimate the cost of the repair.  Believe me, the wreckage is not a pretty sight and the repair bill will leave every taxpayer gasping.  No doubt Ministers will congratulate themselves on their tough-love approach.  However, will the Taoiseach be able to look in the eye a family whose livelihood has been destroyed by his economic mismanagement and say to it, in the style of Bill Clinton, "I feel your pain"?  Like hell he will.  Those on the Government benches will feel very little pain over the measures announced today; they are too well cushioned for that.The levy the Minister introduced will mean extra income tax of €500 or €600 for those earning €50,000 or €60,000 per annum.  Such a family does not merit a doctor-only medical card or a full one but many such families must often pay for treatment for really serious medical conditions.  If they want to go to an accident and emergency unit, they must now pay €100, an increase from €66.  If they must pay privately for a fast operation to save the life of an elderly parent in the absence of a medical card, as many now do to avoid queues, they will find the tax refund to which they were entitled heretofore has been reduced to 20%.  I ask the Minister to rethink this before the introduction of the Finance Bill.There are many well-documented cases of families taking second mortgages on houses to pay for expensive private medical care because it is not otherwise available or because, for one reason or another, their health insurance coverage or that of their parents is not intact.  They will take a very heavy hit in today's budget.  The Minister has not thought through the consequences of this for the complex arrangements families make to support themselves and their loved ones when their private medical insurance does not cover them or when their only option is to go to a private institution not included in their insurance plan.  For years, we have heard talk about soft and hard landings.  The Taoiseach assured us time and again that we would have a soft landing.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is the Taoiseach's trusted pilot but the Minister does not know the territory and he is carrying tonnes of excess baggage.  There is a heavy fog, it is pitch dark outside and he has not a clue where to make a landing, either hard or soft.This is a budget that compounds the conditions it was meant to address.  It does nothing to stem the haemorrhage of jobs, it abandons a long-held policy of having little or no borrowing for current spending and it puts important capital projects like public transport on the long finger at the time we should be preparing the country to take advantage of any recovery.  Everywhere we look, the economic news is troubling.  While it took Ministers a long time to come to terms with that cold reality, for many of our people it is not really news.  They have been paying the price for months, even if the Taoiseach failed to notice.Some 80,000 workers have lost their jobs this year, the largest annual increase ever recorded.  Official records show that there are 110,000 children living in poverty.  It has never been more difficult to save or to retire and thousands of pensioners have to choose between food and fuel because the rising price of both is not matched by either their pension or their fuel allowance.  I welcome the increase of €2 in the fuel allowance, which is great.

He could have acceded to the request of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which works at the coalface, to have at least doubled the fuel allowance, which would have only taken another €6.Across Ireland, young people have to come to terms with a reality that their parents never thought would return.  In the coming five to six weeks, thousands of young men and women and their proud parents will go to graduation ceremonies in universities and institutes of technology all over Ireland.  Many will have failed to get jobs since they left college or will have stop-gap temporary jobs.  Many graduates of earlier years — engineers, architects, scientists, accountants, surveyors and solicitors — have been let go during the past month.  The best brains of a generation will feel as if the dream that so many have hoped for is slowly slipping away.It has been an interesting three months for the two Brians.  It has been interesting to watch both of them respond so belatedly to the new economic reality.  They sat on their hands all summer until it was too late.  Their first reaction to this crisis was traditional bluster, with the same old tired line over and over again: "The fundamentals of our economy are strong."  In the same way, the bank regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank used to say: "The fundamentals of our banking system are strong."  Every unemployed worker would love to have a euro for every time he or she heard that dreary slogan all through the spring and summer as jobs were lost and the banking crisis moved inevitably to a long-predicted meltdown.I have every confidence we can steer ourselves out of this crisis.  The whole world knows the Irish are a resilient race.  One lesson we should learn is that we cannot steer ourselves out of this situation by heading in the same direction with the same failed policies.  I do not fault the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for all the problems we are facing now, but I fault his delay in waking up to their existence and his tardy response. I fault the economic philosophy the Government has slavishly followed for the past 11 years.  It is a philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down.  It is a philosophy that says even common sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise.  It is a philosophy that lets vested interests — the speculators, the developers and the bankers — dictate our country's economic policy, so it worked for them instead of for our people.  Let us be clear.  What we have seen in the past few months is nothing less than the final verdict on this philosophy, a philosophy that completely failed the most basic stress test.A Government less given to vanity and to lecturing the rest of the world on the brilliance of its economic achievements would have seen the dangers and prepared for them.  The economy has become seriously unbalanced on the watch of the Taoiseach and the Minister.  Basically, after months reassuring everyone that things were under control, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, now says the sky is falling and that to save the world we have to do exactly what he says.  Why should we respect his word today?  I heard his party constituency colleague, Deputy Sean Fleming, state on "Prime Time" last week that the people who led us into this mess are not the people to lead us out of it.  He meant the failed bankers, but his words are no less pertinent with regard to the Taoiseach and his Ministers.This budget is the legacy of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to Irish families.  The true cost will hang like a millstone around the necks of our people for years to come.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to international events as though the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, was simply the victim of international events rather than being very culpable in regard to matters such as the property bubble.  It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that created the costly decentralisation fiasco.  It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that created the HSE fiasco — we are paying McKinsey consultants millions of euro to undo that Micheál Martin monument to bad governance.  It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that made the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, continue to inflate the property bubble with tax breaks when every single warning shouted stop.  It was bad ministerial judgment, not international events, that made the public finances so utterly dependent on an overheating house building sector.I want to put one question to the Minister and I hope it will not bewilder him.  I am sure he and the Taoiseach would want to be remembered not just for economic success, however elusive that seems in present circumstances, but also for a progressive record in advancing social justice, so let him answer the following simple question.  After 12 years in power, why is income inequality still so deep and why is wealth inequality in assets worse than when the Government took office?The Government has invented more tax breaks in a decade for the rich than their accountants can keep up with.  It is a Government which has presided over a widening, not a narrowing, of inequalities of personal wealth.  The top 1% now own more of the nation's wealth than they ever did.  Property and land speculators have been the biggest beneficiaries of the Government's terms in power but the Government coaxed them on, regardless of the consequences.I note the Minister reduced the top rate of stamp duty on commercial property from 9% to 6%.  In a falling commercial market, there is merit in this but, at the same time, why did he not pay attention to the young couple stuck in their first house but who cannot afford to trade up?  Why always go after the commercial interests of the big property developers?One of the reasons we are not creating more businesses in this economy is the cost of rents.  Most major commercial property is owned by the same large group of developers who have dominated Fianna Fáil's economic philosophy.  The rents they charge are astronomical, but there is nothing in the budget that insists that property developers begin bringing rents down so that young people who want to start businesses can pay a reasonable and affordable rent.At the outset, the Minister referred to the bank situation.  To recall a phrase uttered by a colleague of his — I nearly said "former colleague" — Boston and Berlin now have one thing in common.  They are both nationalising or part-nationalising their banks.  It appears inevitable the Government will have to provide some mechanism to allow banks and financial institutions to recapitalise.  If that is to be done it must be based on one clear proviso.  The people will support decisions made by the Government to salvage the principal elements of the banking system but the Government and taxpayers must get what people who provide capital are entitled to, namely, a share in ownership so that all the gains of a successful rescue plan do not go to the people who made the mess in the first place but back to the taxpayers who made significant sacrifices to calm the situation down and rescue it.The banks have to be made fit for purpose.  We need to take a back-to-basics approach to the banking sector.  The reformed financial system, built by the Government and paid for by the taxpayer, needs to be plain and old fashioned.  In the United States it is called "plain vanilla finance".  The banking system should be restored to its traditional role of supplying credit to the real economy, with as few complications or fancy products as possible.  We need a system in which retail banks accept savings and make loans for regular businesses, large and small, and regular mortgages for families around the country, and where the complexity of financial products is strictly limited and subject to the kind of independent safety tests associated with new drugs or cars.  That is serious hard-touch regulation and citizens will rightly insist on it as the price of any further rescue package.Despite the huge rise in the budget deficit and the many spending cuts and tax increases outlined by the Minister, the budget's impact will probably be overshadowed in the next ten years by further tax increases to pay for bank bailouts.  The Minister has said the unnecessarily wide-ranging bank guarantee will not cost taxpayers anything.  He is wrong and taxpayers will pay the price for his, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen's, misjudgments.The budget brings back many unhappy memories of an era we hoped would never return.  One nasty feature of that era, which we only discovered years later through the tribunals, was the hidden offshore accounts.  We remember Ansbacher man and his arrogant determination that taxes and sacrifices were for the little people only, while he and his friends lived in splendid luxury as their fellow citizens endured job losses, high taxes and emigration.  What measures does the budget have to share the burdens of today?  I see very few.  There is no doubt the coping classes, people on PAYE earning between €40,000 and €80,000, will pay for the bulk of the measures in the budget.  They will bear the brunt of the cutbacks and levies.  When they go to an accident and emergency unit that cost will rise from €66 to €100.  They will pay and pay.  Why then are we not sharing any burdens in the budget?  We tolerate the tax exiles who still dominate many sectors of the economy while refusing to contribute their share.  We still riddle the tax codes with exemptions and breaks for the super rich, including the very people whose banking practices have brought us to the sorry state we are in today.Most citizens have braced themselves for sacrifices.  I am not at all sure that feeling is shared by our local "Masters of the Universe", who blithely demand cuts in public services to facilitate their unlimited greed and avarice.  I wonder if that banker who expressed his desire to see cutbacks just after he had been bailed out will give the budget top marks.  He will not suffer but many of the people he recommended should suffer, will.  I wish I was more confident the Minister had some of those people in his sights today.  All the talk of burden sharing is shallow unless people see clear evidence of it, but there is precious little such evidence in today's budget.The present crisis bears the fingerprints of the extreme free-market advocates who have dominated economic thought for two decades.  What is missing from the budget is a recognition that those two decades of freebooting, unregulated markets are over and that we are turning a page into a new period.  The free marketeers always had a naive belief that free markets are always self-correcting and that markets left to themselves will always achieve the best results.  They are the ideologues who believe any regulation of private business is fundamentally wrong.  They are the ones who have resisted the regulation of financial markets and the supervision of financial institutions.  They believe that government is always the problem, never the solution.  Some members of Government have done much to undermine the ethos of the public service.  They are so hostile to any notion of public service that they appear to forget the vast bulk of teachers, doctors and nurses are public servants.  The motto of those ideologues is "Public service bad, private sector good".When there is a crash the self-same ideologues argue we should cover their losses with the people's taxes.  The same people always demand lower and lower taxes for themselves and many pay none at all.  There is an alternative viewpoint and it is high time it was heard.  It is one that recognises the importance of markets, but also recognises the limitations of markets.  It recognises the role of the public good and market regulation.  It values transparency, honesty, competition and innovation but does not encourage speculation or reward for merely short-term success.  It is a political culture that values profit and productivity achieved through hard work, but does not endorse the ethic of the quick buck or the scheme nobody else knew about because it was in the small print of the tax code as a way of avoiding taxes.I believe in incentives and rewards.  I also believe trust and traditional ethical standards are essential elements of the financial and business system.  I believe in the profit motive but I also believe in responsibility to the community where those profits are made.  After a decade of so much squandered on the short term, we must encourage a much wider debate in the community on the role values play in economics and business.  We need to have a debate on how we assess the long-term values of companies, their executives and their assets against their long-term performance, as opposed to the short-term asset bubbles we have experienced at such a high cost that are now wreaking so much devastation in the economy.  This is very much a values debate; greed and mega profits as against a culture that values hard work and thinking about and preparing for tomorrow.In many ways today is the epitaph of the Celtic tiger.  I regret the lack of a universal child care system and the lack of provision for pre-school education.  What can one say about the Greens?  It is a bit like Norman Tebbit and "On your bike".  We welcome the provision of €1,000 to buy a bike once every five years.

If nothing else, this budget reinstates the primacy of roads.  The indications are that we will pay from €700 million up to €900 million over the next five years because of Kyoto Protocol commitments.  I would have welcomed more initiatives in the budget to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and make our contribution to reduce global warming.This budget is about Fianna Fáil hubris.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Minister for Finance.  The former US president Mr. Harry Truman kept a plaque on his desk that read, "The buck stops here".  For the last year, as we witnessed the turn in the tide of our economy, the Government has run itself along the lines of, "The buck stops nowhere".  I wish to make it clear to this Government that the buck stops with it.  It is in charge and was quick to take credit for the boom.  It must, therefore, take responsibility for the bust.  Sinn Féin approached the budget prepared to support any measures that would stabilise and reinvigorate the economy, prioritise job creation, address the significant shortfall in public finances, deal with cost-of-living pressures, and provide solutions for those who have become unemployed or who face unemployment.We argued for the Government to see this budget as an opportunity to turn around the economy.  We wanted a budget that was about more than balancing the books, an approach we believe has the potential to drive us further into recession, rather than lift us out of it.  We wanted it to provide a vision for a new economic model, based on sound industries such as research and development, exports and a thriving indigenous small and medium enterprise sector, capable of delivering the revenue needed next year to revive the public finances.Today, people wanted to see the beginning of a three year plan to get the economy back on track.  Central to that wish is the creation and retention of jobs and addressing the shortfall in public finances.  The Government fell far short on both counts today.  It failed the leadership test.  It promised to look after the most vulnerable but it did not.  It said it would ensure top earners paid their fair share, but it did not.  It promised frontline services in health and education would be protected but that did not happen either.We can rebuild the economy, but that means taking bold decisions.  It means investing in infrastructure that will create jobs and build competitiveness.  It means helping those who have lost their jobs return to the workforce as quickly as possible and ensure such people are supported properly while that happens.  It means ending the era of tax breaks for the rich, while PAYE workers struggle to survive.  It means truly advancing the all-Ireland economy.  Change is possible and it should have started this afternoon.  It did not and the State will be poorer next year because of that.We have witnessed an extraordinary economic period.  Gross domestic product and gross national product increased exponentially in the past decade.  Ireland turned from an emigrant country to a destination for economic migrants.  We saw an explosion in purchasing power as evidenced by the growth in home ownership, high-end cars and in quality brand names on our shopping streets.  Simultaneously, Government policy ensured that massive private debt accumulated.  As the gap widened, the void between the rich and poor became more obvious and precarious.  The Government spent wildly during this period, mostly on tax breaks for those who least needed them, keeping the consultant industry in business and on wasteful pet projects.  It did not use the budget surpluses to turn Ireland into a first world model.  It used them to buy elections.Anyone believing the Opposition spokespeople who preceded me would have implemented different economic policies which would have led the State down an alternative path need only cast their memories back to these parties' pre-election manifestos in 2007.  Both promised tax cuts alongside increased public spending.  They criticise Fianna Fáil now, but shared the same economic outlook then.  Of course, it was the Government that did the real damage.  It presided over many investment failures, especially with regard to value for money.  There was no strategic investment in broadband, revitalising rural Ireland, renewable energy, ports, or public transport, despite some small exceptions like the Luas.  Of the infrastructural projects undertaken, few came in on time or on budget.  We need only consider the example of the Dublin Port tunnel.  The original cost was €457 million, but it eventually cost €752 million, representing poor value for money.The Government's property-based tax relief left us with many hotels, car parks and shopping centres, instead of social housing, rail lines and wind farms.  Now we face a period of virtually no infrastructure development.  How is the State supposed to develop its competitiveness when it does not have something as necessary as universal, high speed and quality broadband provision?As well as failing to invest, the Government took reckless decision after reckless decision relating to the tax system.  Measures were introduced to the tax base which resulted in a dangerous over-dependence on construction and consumption-related revenue.  Stable sources of tax were cut.  Its failure to grapple with the mistakes it made in the tax system was reflected in abysmal fashion throughout this year and last year, and in its inability to project from month to month what was coming into the Exchequer's funds.  As a result, the Government in the budget had to take into consideration a projected tax receipt shortfall of €6.5 billion for 2008 and now an Exchequer deficit of 11.5% projected to be some €14.7 billion next year.  To put this in perspective, I recall the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, assuring us in this month last year that gross domestic product growth in 2008 would be approximately 3%, more modest than we were used to but growth nonetheless.  Instead, we have seen an unprecedented negative turnaround in growth.  Unemployment has reached its highest level in a decade, resulting in lower income tax returns and a growing demand on the social insurance fund.  Inflation measured 4.3% in September and this has impacted on consumer spending.  Consequently, consumption revenue with VAT returns are €1.1 billion behind target to date.The Government has pointed to international forces for the downturn and tried to deny that the policies it pursued lacked foresight, encouraged instability and indulged speculative greed.  The global downturn has impacted on international trade and the banks' liquidity issue poses its own problems.  However, the Government could have left the State in a much better position to cope with the crisis.  Instead of building the State's competitiveness, Fianna Fáil and its construction partners left us economically dependent on the construction industry, with stamp duty rising from 3% of the Government's total tax take in 1997 to 8% in 2006, accompanied by huge VAT returns from house build costs.  The growth of this sector allowed the Government, the heads of the industry and, of course, the good old banks to profit from those who got into debt when trying to own a home.  In the interim, the Government abandoned real economic development.  Our exports market was ignored.  The banks took the Government's lead.At a recent ISME conference, business people pointed out that over the past ten years, the banks did not want to know them unless they had property.  They were told they could not borrow to support start-up companies unless properties were included in their business plans.  The owners of small and medium-sized enterprises are being denied overdraft facilities by banks which are burdened with properties while simultaneously nursing developers' loans.  The Government's unconditional support of property developers has harmed this State's competitiveness.  Property tax reliefs ate into money that could and should have funded necessary infrastructure.  High property prices had a further detrimental effect on business as rents spiralled.  However, the Government continued to claim, right up to its lengthy summer break, that the fundamentals of the economy were sound.  It is still repeating this.Some deeply misleading claims have been made over recent times.  A recent report, Catching the Wave, made such claims in respect of our export market.  In 2006, foreign-owned firms which are based in Ireland were responsible for 90.2% of all exports from this country.  The indigenous export sector is crying out for Government intervention.  The domestic market is equally badly-off.  The Government has failed to tackle the flooding of the Irish market with cheap imports.  It has not dealt with contentious issues such as sell-by dates and the incorrect labelling of products as "guaranteed Irish".  These two issues were mentioned by the owners of Cappoquin Chickens before the company went into liquidation and had to be sold to foreign owners, who are only willing to pay the staff the minimum wage to keep the operation going.Sinn Féin was attacked by all parties in this House when it said the Government's economic policy was not sustainable and would come crashing down.  Now that the crash has happened, we firmly believe the most important role the Government can play in the current crisis is to ensure there is employment for the many people who are being made redundant.  I refer to those who were working in the construction sector, for example.  Equally, the Government should ensure that people are not made homeless as a result of negative equity and repossessions.In the run-up to this budget, the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the media and the street has centred around how little money the Government will have to run the State next year.  Many people asked how much it would need to borrow and where cuts would need to be made.  Throughout this debate, Sinn Féin argued that there should be a focus on how to create jobs over the next year.  We need to turn the economy around and build a revenue stream that will make cuts in future budgets unnecessary.  Vested interest lobby groups have suggested that overspending by the Government has caused problems for the Exchequer.  They have called for cuts to be made.  However, our level of public spending is the third lowest in Europe.  Lithuania and Estonia are the only countries that spend less than we do.  We are coming from a low base.  Far more spending was required over the last decade to construct the physical and social infrastructure needed to develop the State's competitiveness and eradicate poverty.  Unfortunately, what was spent was spent badly, in the main.Other groups have launched attacks on public sector personnel.  I do not doubt that efficiency savings can be made in the public service.  In this time of financial turmoil, value for money is essential.  However, the last thing the State needs is a reduction in the number of nurses, gardaí or teachers.  We need reviews of bodies like the HSE.  We need leadership from the Members of this House.  How many elected representatives are maintaining their jobs in the public sector, thereby holding onto pensions and other entitlements which accompany such jobs?  We need to bring an end to the giving of disproportionate bonuses regardless of performance.  I refer to the bonuses which were reported in the media last weekend, for example.  We do not need cuts that will harm frontline services and prolong the recession.Sinn Féin has highlighted the spending that is needed to help the most vulnerable people in society.  Their lot has not improved over the past decade.  Many people will tune in to the "Six One News" tonight to learn if anything has been done to help them pay their exorbitant mortgages, to keep them in employment, to provide books, uniforms and school meals for their children, to provide child care places so they do not have to fork out thousands of euro each month for private facilities, to alleviate their health costs and to reduce the impact of inflation on their diminishing wages.  I am conscious of the plight of people in more desperate situations.  I refer to those who have become unemployed, who are struggling to get by on inadequate welfare payments, who are at risk of fuel and food poverty this winter, who fear for their children's health and their own health, who face eviction from unscrupulous landlords or whose homes may be repossessed by the banks.In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin called for supports to be given to the most vulnerable people in society.  We believe the Government has a responsibility to protect the weakest first.  It should take care of children, the elderly, the sick, the poor and people with disabilities before it worries about anyone else.  The Government could have shown more foresight.  It could have put in place a three-year plan to get the economy back on track.  Instead, it is engaging in a book-keeping exercise.  A former US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, turned the tide of his country's economic fortunes when he established what was known as the time as the "New Deal".  Under that programme, widespread government borrowing took place to fund major public works, employ millions of people and slowly bring the economy back to life.  The "New Deal" showed initiative and courage.Sinn Féin argued in the run-up to the budget that immediate economic stabilisation measures should be taken.  We said that the Government should prioritise job creation, for example, by initiating an immediate retraining programme for construction workers to direct them into the renewable energy sector and other industries.  We proposed that the commitments under the national development plan in the areas of social and affordable housing and school building be frontloaded to provide necessary infrastructure and secure jobs and tax revenue.  Under this budget, however, investment in social housing is to decrease by 2% and investment in affordable housing is to decrease by a whopping 30%, which is totally unacceptable.At the end of 2007, the National Pensions Reserve Fund contained €21.2 billion.  In March of this year, it was estimated that the size of the fund had dropped to €19.4 billion.  It is clear that money is being lost on the stock markets, although much of the losses are only on paper until the moneys are withdrawn and any gains realised.  It would be more responsible for the Government to use a proportion of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for infrastructural investment.Sinn Féin has called on the Government to reduce the cost of living pressures on the low-paid and those who depend on social welfare by establishing an anti-inflation package and delivering social welfare increases.  It has asked the Government to bring forward a set of proposals to reduce cost pressures on small businesses and to put in place specific programmes to support indigenous businesses which are seeking to boost their export capacity.  It has proposed that the tax system be overhauled to assist those on low incomes.  Those at the higher end of the scale should pay their fair share of taxes if we are to generate sufficient revenue to meet medium-term investment and current spending demands.In the wake of the decision earlier this month to guarantee the banking system, we called for the Government to use the guarantee as a further way of contributing to the Exchequer and stabilising the economy.  We want the banks to make a windfall payment to the State, as a proper payback for the taxpayers' insurance.  A levy should be introduced on the banks' profits as part of the new regulatory regime.  We want the State to have shares in the banks and take positions on their boards so it can monitor the interests of the taxpayer.  Measures should be introduced as part of the guarantee to protect those who are facing home repossessions.  The banks have a duty to take the steps needed to reschedule the mortgage payments of low-income families.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service should be put on a statutory footing to ensure it has the authority to negotiate with the banks.This budget, as well as stabilising the economy next year, should have aimed to stimulate it in the medium to longer term.  Sinn Féin wants investment under the national development plan to prioritise public transport, communication, health, education, renewable energy and child care.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	321	We want investment in education and training programmes to be linked to information technologies.  We also want the national action plan for social inclusion to be delivered.  Our approach to this budget has been unique.  Rather than focusing on cuts, we focused on revenue generating ideas and job creation.  It is a poor indication of what we will face in next year's budget that this Government did not take the same approach, but chose instead to make savings in areas where we can least afford them.For too long, our taxation system has been biased in favour of the well off.  I have already mentioned how this Government's policies led to instability in the tax system, but nobody should think that such instability was an accident of design.  We have the fifth lowest tax take in the European Union.  The tax structure by tax type — indirect 44%, direct 40% and social security contributions 15% — differs considerably from the structure typical for the EU as a whole, where on average there is less reliance on indirect tax.  The fact is, if there is high VAT, there is a range of stealth taxes on everything from accident and emergency visits to waste management, and this will have a disproportionate effect on those with the least in their pockets.Sinn Féin has long called for reform of the tax system.  There are people in the system paying too little and people paying too much.  The biggest con-trick the Government ever played on the people was convincing them that we have a low-tax economy.  We only have a low-tax economy for those who are well off.  Everyone else is paying through the nose.  In our pre-budget submission, we called for the Government to undertake a rolling review of taxation, through the Commission on Taxation, with a view to increasing the number of income tax bands.  This morning the Minister for Finance stated that the Government's priority was to protect the vulnerable and to ensure that those who earn the most pay the most in tax.  He said he supported a progressive tax system.  This would be a major Government U-turn in policy if it was delivered, but it has not been delivered.  Instead, the budget only tinkered at the edges of the taxation system and with stealth taxes, as opposed to overhauling the system to bring in money to the Exchequer.  The Minister has made the situation far worse for many families, particularly those most vulnerable.  The income levy and the VAT increase are a disgraceful attack on people on low incomes.  They are neither fair nor progressive.I welcome the Minister's decision to take on board our proposals to increase the PAYE tax credit to meet the annual increase in the cost of living, the increase in betting tax and DIRT.  However, we have serious concerns regarding other measures. The proposed income levy is regressive.  While it is positive that people earning more than €100,000 will pay 2%, the fact that all those on under this figure will pay the same levy means it disproportionately hits those on low incomes.  It is almost a flat tax.  The increase of the 21% VAT rate by 0.5% is also regressive.  It will hit low income families and does nothing to reverse the State's dependence on consumption taxes, one of the key contributors to the current public finance difficulties.Prior to the budget, we had called for all discretionary tax relief schemes to be available at the standard rate.  This would have yielded €1 billion to the Exchequer.  It is staggering that the Minister only tinkered with this.  It is also hard to understand why the Government failed to abolish the ceiling on PRSI.  The social insurance fund will come under more pressure until we can get people back into work, and this measure would have provided essential resources.I am also concerned that there were no firm proposals on utilising the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  We called for this money to be used to fund critical infrastructure projects that would improve competitiveness and provide jobs.  There is now concern that this fund will be used to help recapitalise the banks.  That should not happen.  The Minister said that no vested interests were served in this budget, yet the Construction Industry Federation's demands on cutting commercial stamp duty have been almost wholly met by slashing this tax from 9% to 6%.We proposed a number of additional revenue producing initiatives, such as increasing motor tax for the highest emitting non-commercial vehicles, increasing the health levy by 1% on those earning more than €100,000 per annum, introducing legislation to end tax-exile status and ending State subsidies to private schools.  Denis O'Brien and Bono, two of our biggest tax exiles, will not be perturbed by this budget.  Bono's concern for Africa is laudable, but it is a pity he does not share the same concern for the people in this State.The fear among the most vulnerable in society that this budget would harm them most has been realised.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	325	We have all heard the reports that social welfare payments would be frozen, that child benefit would be taxed, that the Department of Social and Family Affairs had the biggest expenditure and is a so-called drain on the public purse strings.  This system is meant to aid those in need, whether they have lost their jobs, are part of a family on low income, are elderly, disabled or ill.  Social welfare is not charity for the State to dole out at will.  It is a right and an entitlement, and the money within the system is put there ever year by taxpayers, conscious of the fact that they might one day need to access it.  If the budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is rising, the Government should look at why so many are accessing the system, and set about finding solutions to get people off social welfare and back into employment.  The Government's responsibility is not about making savings that will harm the most vulnerable.This budget did not take that sensible approach.  Instead, it chose to make savings by cutting payments like the early child care supplement.  This supplement was introduced as a poor attempt at dealing with the lack of a functioning State child care policy.  There was no attempt to make this cut equitable.  In a recent parliamentary question, I asked how much money would be saved were this payment  to be made only to families earning less than €100,000 per annum.  The response, based on revenue estimates, was that this process of payment would save the state €71 million.  Did the Government undertake any kind of study regarding this proposal before it made this decision, or did it just arbitrarily decide to slash a percentage of the payment to everyone?The individual payment increases will do nothing to make next year any easier for those struggling with poverty.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul reported a 50% increase in requests for assistance in the first half of 2008.  Threshold has highlighted the significant increase in illegal evictions caused by landlords running into mortgage arrears, and a dramatic increase in home repossession.  Merchant's Quay Ireland reported an 11% increase in the number of meals it provided to homeless people this year.  Failure to protect our most vulnerable in this budget will do nothing to fix our economy next year.  It will merely create more poverty traps, more misery and more social problems in the years to come.When cuts were mentioned in advance of this budget, the Government stated clearly that they would not affect front line services in health and education.  This budget is an attack on our health services.  The paltry increase in funding falls far short of clearly identified needs and will undoubtedly lead to deterioration in services.  Health cuts were introduced before last year's budget and have accelerated since.  Patients were being turned away this morning from Our Lady of Lourdes hospital in Drogheda because of overcrowding.  Deputy Ó Caoláin has learned that a promised and much needed ambulance will not now be provided to Monaghan General Hospital.  The orthopaedic unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Navan looks set to close for four months.  The Minister for Health and Children and Professor Brendan Drumm promised that cuts would not affect patient care, but we have not seen any proof.  This budget will speed up the process.  Patients will suffer and patients will die as a result of this budget.Far from representing savings, these cuts are shortsighted and will cost more in the long run.  The cuts in home help hours and other services in the community for older people will force more of them from their own homes, and into expensive nursing home care, much of which will be subsidised by the State at a huge cost.The closure of hospital services across the State for weeks on end to stay within HSE budgets is another false economy as hospital staff continue to be paid and facilities maintained while these facilities are closed to patients.  I refer to an example from my area.  Last Christmas, Navan orthopaedic unit was closed for several months, but the nurses, consultants and other staff were still paid and the only saving was in the replacement body parts, hips and knees, which were to be used.  The people who needed those replacements in December when the closure occurred still needed them in January, February, March and April, the only difference being that they were suffering more and the queues were growing longer.  This is very poor efficiency and shame on the Government for allowing that to happen and for continuing with that disgraceful policy.With rising unemployment leading to an increase in the numbers of people eligible for the medical card, it is essential that services for medical card patients are maintained.  GPs must be discouraged from setting quotas for medical card holders.  It is wrong that entitled families are refused by doctor after doctor.  The Government has failed to fulfil its own commitments to index the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage and double the income limit eligibility of parents of children under six years of age and treble them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability. When the over 70s non-means tested medical card was introduced, Sinn Féin asked why the same principle was not applied to people under 18, people with a range of medical conditions and, indeed, all citizens.  This scheme has been withdrawn and that demonstrates the lack of consistency and the inequity at the heart of Government health policy.  That will hurt many elderly people who do not meet whatever means criteria are set out for the medial card.  It is most unfortunate the Green Party could not exercise more influence to ensure the scheme was continued.Given the current shortfall in public finances, it is crucial that the Government ends the massive waste of resources and inequality caused by the two tier public-private health system.The cost to the Exchequer of tax foregone in capital allowances to the developers of private hospitals rose from €1.9 million in 2004 to €10.6 million in 2006, with figures for 2007 and 2008 not yet available.  The cost in 2006 alone would fund over 6,000 extra full medical cards for a year.  The private hospital co-location scheme is another massive subsidy to the private health business.  The cost of tax breaks for these developments is not yet known and it cannot be quantified.  The land to which they have been given access is a huge asset which will be lost to the public health system.  Ultimately, the only guarantee of equal access and real efficiency in our health services will be fundamental reform and the establishment of a universal public health system, with access based on need alone, free at the point of delivery and funded from general, fair and progressive taxation.Sinn Féin wants to see the immediate establishment of a health funding commission to report within a year on the costs of the transition to a new single tier public health system with universal provision, taking into account all spending on health services under the current systems, including State funding and spending on private health insurance.Education is another area which the Government promised to protect from cuts in this budget.  Given that the system is barely existing on its current funds, a marginal increase is akin to cuts in real terms.  We accept that this is a new economic environment, but the education sector must be considered as part of an overall strategy to reverse the current economic outlook and to ensure the long-term stability of the Irish economy.  We cannot build a knowledge economy if we do not invest in knowledge from pre-school up through the system.Perhaps the most blatant neglect and disregard shown to our young people by the Government is in the area of school buildings.  The Minister has effectively deceived the Dáil on this issue.  Investment in primary school building was not increased but rather it was reduced by 5%.  Public-private partnership costs have gone up by 30%.  The recently introduced school building programme is completely inadequate.  Only 25 schools are to benefit, which means hundreds of schools will be disappointed.  One third of our primary schools have applied for a new school or need building works on their existing school.  Glenswilly national school in Donegal has been innovative in its response.  It has renamed itself, Seeking an Extension since 1992.  Unfortunately, the Government showed no such innovation.  I called to St. Joseph's school in Mell in Drogheda this morning where 211 pupils are crammed into all sorts of closeted conditions.  Two cloakrooms have been converted into classrooms.  Other pupils wishing to use the toilet are forced to go through those tiny cloakrooms.

Those children are not receiving an adequate education.  Six of the classes in St. Joseph's school in Mell have more than 30 students.This programme came on the back of the revelation that many schools that have been given approval for extensions cannot proceed to construction because the funds provided only cover a fraction of the actual cost.  The Department of Education and Science spends €35.5 million per annum on prefabricated buildings.  That is a complete waste of money.  It is money down the drain.  I spoke earlier about how the downturn in the domestic building sector provides an opportunity to address historic underfunding of school buildings in a way that will provide real value for money.  Now is the time for immediate recommencement of the school building programme to ensure that all schools with unsafe and substandard accommodation are upgraded immediately.I also draw attention to the inadequate primary capitation grant system.  Energy costs, waste disposal charges, water charges, with cleaning and hygiene costs, have increased dramatically and schools can no longer meet those costs.  On average, after receiving all funding available from the State, each primary school has an average annual debt of €23,000.  That means that €82 million has to be raised by parents, friends and school boards this year to cover the debts of primary schools throughout the State.  This places pressure on parents, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet in the current climate.  That is a pressure that should not exist in a State with so-called free education.  A total of €82 million in this year alone is some free education system.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The Minister's party with Fianna Fáil and with what is left of the Progressive Democrats has presided over an absolutely disgraceful budget.  The Minister of State should have used his influence to make this budget more progressive and effective for the people, but he failed to do so.  I am happy to allow him to heckle me because I will call it as it is and I will hold him and the Government to account regardless of whether he likes it.This budget provides no funding to solve the problem of classroom overcrowding.  The programme for Government commits the Government to:Increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000. This will enable us to reduce class sizes.The Minister of State should tell the children of Mell that.  The aim is to reduce class sizes to 24 by 2010-11.  There is little chance of this happening, given the attitude of the Government this afternoon.  Yet, almost 100,000 children remain in classes of 30 pupils or more.  The lack of funding in this sector has also had detrimental effects on the identification of children with special needs and has failed to solve the issue of illiteracy.  An estimated 500,000 Irish adults have literacy difficulties.  This is an educational crisis.  To have any hope of developing the economy, we need to eradicate illiteracy, introduce paid educational leave as a statutory entitlement and make work-based learning and training available to all workers.  In yet another budget, the Government has failed to identify the potential for education development and the return it will bring, not just for the next generation but for ourselves.Given the public finance shortfall, we knew this budget would be tough.  I have talked about what has got us into this mess and I have had a go at the Government for decisions it has taken and those they have failed to take.  However, when all is said and done, the Sinn Féin Deputies were prepared to come into this Chamber and support measures which we believed offered responsible solutions to the current mess created by the Government.I appreciate the pressure the Minister for Finance labours under in delivering this budget, but this budget will not turn around the economy.  It contains short-sighted and, in many cases, irresponsible measures.This budget needed to look to the future.  It had to deliver a new value for money ethos.  It needed to contain a vision for the creation of jobs.  It had to deliver funding to those Departments that will help the economy in the long term, namely, the Department of Education and Science and those dealing with the fallout from years of underfunding, such as the Department of Health and Children.  Instead, it tinkers at the edges of the crisis, makes cuts where they will hurt the most and displays no real political leadership to get this State back on its feet.  We needed a brave budget but instead we have been presented with a blinkered one.I look forward to continuing the debate on this matter.  I also look forward to continuing to hold the Government to account because, by God, that needs to happen.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	339	If one walks down any street in the country one meets unemployed people, students, housewives, small business people and shopkeepers.  These people all want to live in a country where they can go about their business as best they can within the rule of law.  The Government has introduced a savage and blunt instrument.  For the first time, every person who earns a bob is drawn into the tax net.The point was made earlier today that we have moved from having a €6 billion surplus to a €15 billion deficit inside two years, which is staggering.  The Government has shown no imagination or initiative in the budget to give hope and opportunity to business, small business, retailers and young people and to collect this money — after borrowing €11 billion — it has introduced a sledge hammer to crucify every person who shows initiative by taking a part-time job for three or five hours and earns €2, €10 or €20.The Government has brought every person into this.  In the past, Fianna Fáil always had some modicum of care for people earning low wages and would tell those earning below €25,000 or €30,000 that it would protect them and we were told in the run up to this budget that the vulnerable would be protected.  In any town in the country or in any part of Dublin a woman who works five or six hours stacking shelves in a supermarket at the weekend because she wants a few bob to buy material for her family or children will have to pay the 1% levy introduced in this budget.  After exhaustive conversations at the social partnership talks, low-wage earners were given 0.5% of a pay increase only to have it wiped out entirely by this 1% levy.  The Government has used a savage and crude economic instrument to do down every single person who shows any initiative.  Most particularly, those who will feel this most are those in the low-wage earning group who go out of their way to find some little job by which they can raise a few extra quid.  The Government has pointed the finger at them, telling them they must pay for the way it has mismanaged the economy and wasted hundreds of millions of euro.  Now that the Government is flailing around in desperation, it finds an instrument to bring in €1.18 billion in the year.Those who are able-bodied and high earners will also take the hit.  However, for the middle-income and low-income groups, this levy will nail them to an economic cross.  This, and all the other stealth taxes and increases in charges that have been introduced in the budget, will make Ireland in 2009 a most unhappy place for people to live in.  The levy is savage, crude, blunt and way over the top.  It smacks of complete desperation from a Government that has shown no initiative, inspiration or hope in this budget.The mortgage interest relief measurem, with which I do not object, speaks for itself.  The increase in specified rates for preferential home and other loans is simply another revenue raising mechanism which I will not support.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I am surprised that despite all the leaked briefings to the newspapers we have this regressive measure of taxation.  I am particularly surprised it comes from the Taoiseach who has had three years' experience in Merrion Street and has lost no opportunity since he took office to announce his republican values and ideals and his commitment to equality of treatment.  This levy is the most unequal treatment of income earners we have seen in recent decades.  It smacks of the most extraordinary residue of the dying corpse of the Progressive Democrats, of which I thought we had seen the end.Illustrative cases on how the income tax changes will affect taxpayers are listed in the Budget Statement.  The first case is that of Gary, a single factory worker, and his daughter Gabby.  One feels that they should be jumping for joy because, while money is taken from them by the levy, they are shown to be still better off.  That undermines the donation that was given to them in the first place.We know the spin doctors suggested not to touch tax rates but introduce a levy on income.  They suggested not to create spin around perceptions of taxation rates but introduce a measure which was introduced before.  We did it together in government in 1993 when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance.  While that levy, to bridge a gap, was 1%, it was only for one year.  Those were different times with different circumstances.  We are now in a structurally different set of economic circumstances with revenue and expenditure.The various illustrative cases listed in pages C.19 to C.23 in the Budget Statement suggest taking money out of one pocket and leaving some in the other.  It is less than what was originally decided by the Oireachtas as to what these people needed in the first instance.  However, they are expected to feel grateful because they are better off.  Whatever else the levy does, it confronts the Taoiseach's professions of commitment to republican egalitarianism.  They are torn asunder by this measure.In one year the levy will bring in €1.1 billion, much needed because of the gaps that have occurred in the tax yield.  I am not arguing with the Government's need for a revenue take.  However, what would be the equivalent of loading that levy on the 20% and 41% tax rates?  What figures did the Government look at when it decided to apply the levy across the board?  It is difficult for us on this side of the House to evaluate the full nature of the decision made since we do not know the quantitative nature of the alternatives.  What are the administrative implications of taxing an extra 600,000 people who are not in the tax net?  On which agency's shoulders does that burden fall?  Are the IT and other collection mechanisms in place to deal with this?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The very fact that this levy is entirely lacking in discrimination is my main reason for opposing resolution No. 1.  Some 660,000 people were exempt from income tax before today.  They will now be brought into the tax net within the remit of this 1% levy without any discrimination, discernment or regard to their conditions.  It is not simply a 1% levy for high earners and middle-income earners.  It includes those on the minimum wage, the casual and part-time worker and those who were previously never in the tax net.The Government long boasted about its objective to affect the marginal rate at only 20% of taxpayers.  That has never been achieved.  We used to hammer away at that on the benches and the Department of Finance changed the system of calculating those in the marginal rate.  The band rates broadly broke down to about one third in each rate.  Now, up to 660,000 people will be liable under this levy.  That is the major objection to the levy.This is a nightmare budget that focuses merely on where revenue can be raised.  Everything that moves has been taxed.  Earlier, a colleague asked me what we were going to say about the resolutions.  I said we would be supporting some of them and vehemently opposing others.  He said, "You must be mad; can you imagine what Fianna Fáil would do to you if you had won the election?"

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I can only imagine the Ministers, Deputies O'Dea, Dermot Ahern and the rest, if the country had been plunged into this nightmare when they were in opposition.  The enormous figures are frightening — a general Government deficit of over €12 billion and the debt equity ratio rising to 43%.  How could we have been plunged into such a hole?  How could there have been such a transformation after the Taoiseach personally, as Minister for Finance, brought in four budgets?  Yet, we have ended up in this cul-de-sac.  I join my colleague, Deputy Quinn, and others in opposing this crude method of levying money on the poorest people with the lowest incomes.  There is no exemption.  It does not start from an income of €50,000.  There is a tiered structure at the top for people on very high earnings, from €100,000 upwards, but casual or part-time workers and low earners generally will be hit.  That cannot be justified and is not in keeping with the protestations by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to look after people at the bottom of the ladder.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I will confine my remarks to the first financial resolution.  This levy, which could be properly described as Lenihan's levy, is the most dishonest aspect of the budget.  It is described as a levy merely as a fig leaf to maintain the pretence that tax rates are not being increased.  If the Government had any real integrity and was not interested in a sleight of hand public relations exercise, it would raise additional taxation in an honest and open way.  As Deputy Quinn and others said, it would examine the 41% rate or the 20% standard rate and would in an honest and considered way bring a measure before the House.  I am not saying I would support that either, but at least there would be some thought process attached to it and some sensible judgment would be made with regard to the affordability of a tax increase for those confronted by it.  However, a fig leaf is maintained that we have not changed tax rates, we have only introduced a levy.  I am sure Government spokespeople on radio and television will defend the fact that tax rates have remained the same, but this is a piece of nonsense.This is a regressive measure.  I watched the Minister for Finance on the "Six One News" this evening describing this as progressive taxation.  This 1% levy applies to everybody across the community.  Perhaps we should explore that a little further.  Are we going to send tax inspectors into all schools, including primary schools, to check out whether children are doing part-time work for a couple of hours in their local newsagents or cutting the neighbour's lawn once a week?  Do we now expect every post-primary student to make a tax return?  How are we going to inquire into such matters?  As a 14 year old in a family that had very little income, I can recall doing a newspaper round in my school days.  I got up at 6 a.m. to deliver newspapers around the local estate where I lived and earned spare pocket money by doing so.  Even in those days such work did not fall into the tax net.  If any young schoolboys are doing newspaper rounds today, however, they will have to contribute financially for the mess the Government has created.It is extraordinary that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, who have had an involvement in the new national partnership deal, can introduce a 1% levy right across the board, having agreed an extra 0.5% tax reduction for the low paid.  It is a grossly dishonest way to deal with the social partners.  Fine Gael has set out its platform for a different approach.  This levy will hit people who cannot afford to pay it and who should not be brought into the tax net.  The labyrinthine bureaucratic structure that will now have to be created to collect this levy may well result in a substantial portion of it simply being flushed away in administration.  By imposing this levy and other charges, the Government has done exactly what should not be done in an economy facing recession.  A central objective of the budget should have been to protect jobs and ensure that small businesses do not close under financial pressure from reduced consumer spending.  However, this provision and the budget generally takes more money out of the economy at a time when it needs to be stimulated and when people seek reassurances that they will have reasonable funds left available to them.  This levy is essentially the wrong way to go.  It is inequitable taxation.At a time when the Progressive Democrats are going out of business, we are not just reversing the tax policy, which the Government has stood by in two successive elections and the Progressive Democrats proclaimed as being central to their policies, but are doing it in an unprecedented manner.  I do not believe this is a once-off levy or one that we will see for one or two years.

The 1% levy is misconceived.  The Government should examine how it will impact on young people, including children, earning small sums of money to make ends meet in circumstances where no one could have envisaged they would fall into the tax net.  Nonetheless, they will now be brought into the net by this levy.

In the days coming up to this budget, I thought we were being prepared by spin for bad news, but I did not realise that an income levy like this would be increased.  I am shocked by the fact that the Government has gone for what Deputy Shatter accurately called the Lenihan levy.  The suggestion from Ministers is that we are being given unpalatable medicine for a sick economy and somehow it will get better.  This budget is not medicine, however, it is pure poison.  The tax hikes will depress demand, reduce consumer spending and plunge us deeper into recession.  That is what the Government is also doing with capital spending and it is proposing to increase the deficit from 5.5% of GDP to 6%.

It will cost a lot to administer and will bring 600,000 poor people into the tax net, which is socially unjust.  The comments of trade unions were interesting, with ICTU suggesting this decision may, in itself, scupper the national pay deal.  It was led to believe that low-paid workers would receive a 0.5% increase, but they will get a 0.5% cut.  That is because they will now be eligible for taxation while before the budget they were not.  There were other options.  First, the Government could have taken the Fine Gael route of introducing a pay freeze for everyone earning over €50,000.  That would have brought in approximately €600 million and the Minister would not have had to do this.  It is ironic that it appears the pay deal may go down anyway.  The Minister had that choice but he did not do it.There is another alternative, which the Minister probably still has tonight.  I should not really speak for both parties, but I think that most Members on this side of the House would prefer that the Minister would not opt for this regressive attack on the poor and that he would instead increase the standard rate of income tax to 21% and increase the higher rate to 43%.  It would have the same effect, there would be less administrative costs and it would at least be socially just.  Perhaps the opportunity still exists for the Minister to withdraw this proposal and to increase the standard and higher rates of income tax instead.  If he must increase taxes, he should do it that way rather than introduce this levy.  He should not attack the poor and vulnerable in the way he has done.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I want to make a brief comment.  I really cannot understand Fianna Fáil.  My memory of today's budget is of Members on the Government side going back to their constituencies this weekend.  It is of seeing them up there clapping today while people were being robbed.I ask the Taoiseach a simple question.  Why did the Government not impose the levy on incomes over €100,000?  If he wanted, he could have imposed a 2% or 3% levy on those earning €200,000, €300,000 or €400,000.  There are earners of such incomes.The Government is attacking the most vulnerable in society.  It is attacking the poor, the middle classes who are not entitled to medical cards and have to pay for hospital services, doctors and everything else.  This evening I had a telephone call from a woman who has four children.  She told me she did not think she would be able to live in this country any longer, that she had been taxed out of the country today.

The Government should have targeted the people on €100,000 plus who could afford to pay the money instead of attacking the poor who did not pay tax in the past and are now in the tax net, and the middle classes who are already being squeezed.  They are letting the super rich away with it again.  Why did the Government not go for those on €100,000 plus and impose a 2% or 3% levy on the people who could afford it, instead of hitting the poor, the weak and the sick?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The Taoiseach promised in advance of the budget to protect the most vulnerable in Irish society, but any read of it will tell one that he has not done that.  He has not lived up to that claim and that promise.  An income levy of 1% is being introduced.  I would not argue with the introduction of a 2% levy on incomes over €100,000, but the 1% levy applies across the board irrespective of whether one earns €10,000 or €90,000.  I wonder has any calculation been carried out in terms of the cost of administration of imposing such a levy on those on the lowest incomes who are not in the tax net at present and should not be.  I fail to understand the thinking behind it.  Why was a threshold not introduced? It could be commensurate with those at least within the tax brackets.  Those on the lowest level of income, who are, indeed, within the tax net, should also have been excluded.This measure is very regressive and punitive.  It is discouraging of people even though it may, in low income terms, apply in small terms.  This is my question.  Why did the Minister introduce it in this way?  Did he give any serious consideration to it because I warrant, in the lowest income levels, that this will cost more to implement than it will reap.  It will have another dilatory and destabilising effect on already hard-pressed people in the lowest income areas.As we are dealing with a group of resolutions, on the second financial resolution, where mortgage interest relief for non-first-time buyers is to be decreased from 20% to 15%, many of these families are suffering under the raft of measures in terms of cutbacks and increases that the Government has built into this budget.  They are dependent on their home.  They are mortgage payers and that is a further punitive hit that they will face in terms of a 25% reduction in their entitlement to mortgage interest relief.  We cannot accept that glibly without comment.  It is a very punitive measure and I do not believe that it was justifiable.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I think I understand why the Government has done this.  The Government has capsized the economy and found itself in a position where it must increase tax.  Having sold itself to the Irish people as a tax-cutting party and a tax-cutting Government, however, it cannot use the "T" word.  Therefore, it is bringing in a new tax and calling it a levy.  This is a new tax.  It is a dishonest and a regressive tax.  It is dishonest because the Minister will not say that it is a tax and it is regressive because it applies across the board.  The people on the lowest incomes will end up paying this 1% levy.When one thinks about it, in the context of the pay deal that has just been negotiated, the local authority road worker on a low level of pay who is told, under the pay agreement, to take a pay pause until next September or October, is now, in effect, having his pay cut by 1% as a result of this levy.  It applies, not on a graduated basis but to everything, from the first euro he earns to the little bit of work he does on overtime.If the Government had wanted to increase taxation, it should have introduced a proposal that was honest, stated that it was taxation and introduced it on a graduated basis, but it has not done that.  It wants to live the lie that it is a tax-cutting Government while at the same time applying what is a new tax to the lowest levels of pay.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Like Deputy Ring, I was amazed at the reaction from Government backbenchers.  In other years I put it down to the fact that the budget speech took place close to Christmas and that they were a little delirious in anticipation of Santa Claus, but this year there is no excuse for that.  The only thing I can put it down to this time is that they do not realise the full impact of what they are doing.This levy sets aside the boast of the Government every year at budget time that many people were taken out of the tax net.  They are now put back into it again — well, truly and firmly.  A widow on €35,000 or €40,000, for example, would receive a widow's pension but would have part-time work to supplement it.  Obviously, the widow's pension will not be hit with this levy but the employment will be.  It is extraordinary that such a person could be hammered in this way.I will not go down through the new names given to the victims in the budget speech.  However, one of the matters that comes to mind is that at the same time this hit takes place on that vulnerable sector of the community, they may have one or two children due to go to university and if they are on income of over €43,000, they will receive no higher education maintenance grant so they will be hit in that way.I do not think Government backbenchers fully understand how close to the margins that group in society are living at present.  In addition, some of these same people have an excessive mortgage and are experiencing extreme difficulty in paying it.  They are getting no relief there whatsoever as the measure will be broadly Exchequer neutral.  The group in this income area is being clobbered.  They may have thought they would get relief from this budget, but they are getting nothing.  They are just getting it in the teeth.It is extraordinary that a group of people who previously carried the weight of responsibility, who worked hard, who tried to put bread on the table, to provide themselves with a home in difficult circumstances, will now be affected by a levy that is totally indiscriminate in that it affects everybody.I am appalled, not only at the reaction of the backbenchers who stood up and applauded when the budget speech was over.  I wonder will they stand up and applaud in their constituencies in the next few weeks.  I hope they will take responsibility for their actions here and beyond.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13096	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	363	In reference to the Minister's speech, particularly where he dealt with the principles of taxation, he said the imposition of taxes must be fair and equitable and that a higher rate must apply to those on higher incomes.  That sounds familiar in that it reads exactly like my old leaving certificate economics Folens textbook and whoever wrote that probably did the leaving certificate around the same time as myself.  However, I always understood from my leaving certificate economics that taxation should be progressive, not regressive.  In this instance, the 1% levy is regressive.  Those on the margins and people who predominantly probably voted for Fianna Fáil are being punished for their loyalty.  They are the people who did not benefit extensively during the boom years.  Instead, they went out every day to do as they always did and now they are being punished.  It is the wrong strategy and a regressive measure.  When one takes account of the increases in VAT and other increases in the cost of living, it will have a negative impact on their real income.  The real incomes of those in the low income bracket will be severely affected and for that reason we oppose this measure.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	364	Will the 1% levy effectively scupper the social partnership deal?  Under the terms of the deal, low income earners were awarded an 8.5% increase.  That is now gone, and they will effectively pay double that in the levy.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that low income earners will have to pay this levy when they are not even eligible to pay tax?  It appears that people who are not in the tax net at present will have to pay this levy.  It is, therefore, a significant penalty for them.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would clarify this point.Resolution No. 2 is welcome at first glance.  It is good for first-time home owners to get some relief.  However, I have a difficulty with it.  There are people who bought small apartments or so-called starter homes who now have children on the way or growing children and need more space.  Is it fair to exclude that category of people, who are not trading up for flash Harry purposes to impress the neighbours but out of necessity due to changes in their families?  Does the Taoiseach accept this is grossly unfair to that category of people?While the increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers is welcome, will the Taoiseach address the anomaly that exists for low income home owners under the shared ownership scheme?  I can offer the example, about which I had a phone call some moments ago, of a woman who is getting no tax relief on the proportion of her home that is owned by the local authority and rented to her.  In fact, she is paying approximately €485 per month for the rental share in addition to the repayment of the mortgage she has taken out.  Will that rental payment under the shared ownership scheme be included for the purpose of tax relief?

Of the €815 million which it is hoped to raise with this measure in 2009, can the Taoiseach give a breakdown of how much will be received from people who are not paying tax at present, people earning less than €100,000 per annum and people who are earning €100,000 and more per annum?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I do not accept the contention that this is a regressive tax.  It is a progressive tax.  The reason is that it is based on gross income.  If one were to apply this simply to rates, people would have the benefit of access to various allowances and shelters before they would have to pay the 42% rate.  Paying on gross income means that where one's income is higher, one pays a higher amount.  It is not correct to state in that sense that it is a regressive tax; it is progressive.  The amount one pays depends on the amount of income one earns.

A number of points were made and I wish to reply to them in order to have an informed debate.With regard to the fact that it applies to all income, the Opposition Deputies, when they were members of the Government, had no problem imposing 26% tax rates on people's incomes once an exemption equivalent to €95 was passed.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I will put this in perspective.  Over the last decade, as the Deputies have admitted, there has been a huge improvement in reducing the tax burden on people with these incomes.  Members have spoken about this levy applying to people on low incomes, but I am making the point, which is a fair political point, that the Opposition Members when they were in Government regarded 26%, which was then the standard rate, as appropriate for people on these incomes in the past.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	376	That is no justification for introducing this charge.

These people are being charged a levy of 1% of their income.  In terms of the tax burden that applied ten years ago when the Opposition Members were in office, this levy is one twenty-sixth of that burden.

There are 500,000 people, therefore, who are now outside the tax net, who used to pay 26% tax under the Opposition Members' regime.  With regard to the progression we have made, I accept we are introducing a levy of 1% on those incomes.  That is against a background where we progressively, and using our republican egalitarianism, took those people from a tax burden of 26% imposed by the rainbow Government——

Now, due to the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves, we are seeking a 1% contribution from those incomes.  That is the position.Deputy Quinn asked what would be the position if this was done through tax rates.  It would be necessary to apply 1% extra to the standard rate and 2% extra to the higher rate.  However, if one opted for putting 1% on the standard rate and 2% on the higher rate, people would have allowances and tax breaks available to them so the amount of income eligible for the extra 1% or 2% would be far less.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	385	It would be 1% on the standard rate and 2% on the higher rate and that is before sheltering the money and assuming people did not shelter it.  The benefit of the levy is that a person on €200,000 or €150,000 per annum will pay 1% up to €100,100 and 2% for the amount above that.  They cannot make deductions in the normal way.  That is the reason it is a more progressive tax.  It gets the maximum amount from that level of income than would be the case if one opted for the rates route.The second point is that the 500,000 people Fianna Fáil took out of the tax net are to be subject to a tax burden of 1%, which is one twenty-sixth of the burden the Opposition felt appropriate just ten years ago.On Deputy Ring's suggestion that one should impose a levy of 2% or 3% on those paying tax at the higher rate, this would not produce the money required.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	387	To accept the Deputy's proposal, a 10% income levy would have to be charged in respect of all those earning over €100,000, in addition to their existing tax commitment at the rate of 41%. The Deputy made a fair point and I am explaining that this rate would have to be charged on those incomes to obtain the same revenue that is to accrue through the Government's method.  To be fair to Deputy Quinn, he was not arguing about this because we are here to decide the best way to collect the amount of money required.  Having listened to Deputies, I believe my approach is better.On the imposition of the 1% levy on those who have heretofore not been in the income tax net, it is fair to say, with a view to getting the full picture, that successive Governments have used other mechanisms to alleviate the burden on people in this category.  For working families, including lone-parent families, the availability of the family income supplement has been outstanding in ensuring the provision of direct supports to families who require them.  The income limit applying to one child is €500, while it is €570 for the second child and €655 for the third.  As we all know, the eligibility for family income supplement is such that one receives 60% of the difference between what one is earning and the limit pertaining to the size of the relevant family unit.  For example, a person earning €300 per week would receive 60% of the difference between this sum and the sum pertaining to the size of the relevant family unit.  If a lone-parent had one child, he or she would receive 60% of the difference between €300 and €500 as a result of the change in this budget.  This would be part of their income.I accept we are imposing the 1% levy but, to obtain a full picture, as one must in respect of any budget, one must ascertain the income position for any given person.  The families to whom I have referred would be better off even with the imposition of the levy.  Furthermore, all families eligible for a family income supplement earning up to €30,000 per year would be better off even with the 1% levy.  We are including the 1% levy in the manner described to ensure those at the higher end of the scale will pay on gross income without the benefit of a tax shelter or the benefit of allowances.The full picture, unlike that being portrayed, is that we are imposing a 1% levy across all income brackets according to a simple concept.  By making the family income supplement changes for all eligible working families, those families are better off, even with the imposition of the 1% levy.  That is taking care of the situation.

It represents one of the reasons the Government finances are in such difficulty.  I cannot understand why the Government has decided to increase VAT by 0.5%.  The Minister gave little away in her speech, but €208 million is to be taken every year from an area that needs a boost.  The budget should have included measures that assisted in increasing consumer confidence, but instead it has dampened such confidence.Resolution No. 5 deals with the old reliable of tobacco.  Some people claim that it might be the only pleasure that some people have, but I would still support it.  There is also to be an 8 cent rise in the cost of a litre of petrol.  I would love to know the full amount the Government takes in excise duty on petrol every year.  Most of us must use a car as we do not have access to public transport.  Prices have rocketed and the Government seems to have no control over them.  The Competition Authority is not doing its job.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Browne, spoke about the situation in Enniscorthy and claimed that the board of the authority meets once a week to collude to put prices up.  Nothing is done to address this issue.  I would like the Government to investigate the fuel price rises in recent years relative to the increase in the cost of a barrel of oil, and compare it to the decrease in fuel prices relative to the decrease in the cost of oil.  There does not seem to be an inverse relationship between the two and it might do the consumer some good if we got that statistic.Fine Gael will oppose resolution No. 4 and resolution No. 7.  I have mixed views on the betting tax.  Much of Charlie McCreevy's heritage is being destroyed this evening.  Is the Minister concerned that this move will give rise to on-line betting?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Deputy Timmins wondered how much money in excise duty on petrol is gathered up by the Government.  The increase in petrol prices provides rich pickings for the Government.  It obtains 55% of the cost of a litre of petrol, while 37% of the cost is due to refining the oil.  It is outrageous that the Government can go back to the well and add to its take when it is already receiving such a substantial source of income from this area.  Ministers do not seem to understand how difficult it is for commuters who do not have an alternative to using the car.  The public transport infrastructure that should be there is something the Green Party Deputies keep talking about, but they have totally failed to make any difference if this budget is anything to go by.  The people who depend on driving their private cars are already paying high petrol prices.The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security has carefully examined why petrol prices do not seem to follow oil prices when they fall.  They have come down to some extent, but the Government take is inordinately high.  The cost of diesel has uniquely been higher than that of petrol, but rather than deal with that issue, the Government has simply decided to raise the price of petrol.  That will cause difficulties for people who are trying to manage on incomes that are limited.  When the significant increase in tax from this source was pointed out to the Taoiseach, he said they are not spending money on other things.  However, it does raise the issue of fuel poverty.  The most disappointing aspect to the budget is the fact that there is no recognition of the reality of fuel poverty.  People are facing into winter with significantly increased costs in electricity and gas — there are more increases to come — and we get a derisory €2 increase in the fuel allowance.  There is nothing else to support people who are struggling.There is a reference in the section on climate change to the programme known as the home energy savings scheme.  This is about insulation.  We have argued strenuously for a national insulation programme that would provide energy efficiency across the board and would provide work for many construction workers.  That would make sense at a time when we have such difficulties in construction and in meeting our climate change targets.  There is a con trick in these figures.  We were told in the budget speech that €15 million is going into this energy efficiency scheme, but then we discover in the appendices of the budget that €15 million is being taken out of the greener homes scheme.  Windscale was changed to Sellafield, but the leopard never changed its spots.  In this case, the Government is putting money into one scheme which is supposed to save energy and taking it away from another scheme which is supposed to save energy.  It is a sham.

It is pathetic.  It is having a social impact, because people will not be able to afford to pay for fuel over the winter months, but neither is it dealing with the major environmental challenges posed by climate change.  The only way we will see a significant change on climate change is to have legislation that pins the Government down, so that Ministers do not come in here with con tricks at budget time that leave people in the lurch in terms of fuel poverty.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I usually welcome the opportunity to say something, but I do not think anybody can welcome the opportunity to say something about this budget.  VAT has been increased by 0.5%, which may not look like that much, but it will have a negative effect in a declining market where shop owners are laying off workers.  The 5.2% VAT return to farmers has not been re-examined.  I am promised every year that this would be re-evaluated, but I do not see any sign of it at all.  In light of the fact that farmers are being penalised in every way in this budget, in areas such as the farm retirement scheme, insulation aid and other structures, the VAT refund would have been a useful benefit.As one who comes from a Border constituency, just like the Tánaiste, one of the benefits is that petrol prices have been somewhat lower in the South recently.  This has encouraged shoppers and others to do business around the Border areas.  That opportunity will quickly disappear because of this increase.  It is sad this is being done by our Government.  Many people from Cavan-Monaghan must go to work in Dublin.  They will be further penalised.  Jobs have not been created for them in their own constituency.  I know the Tánaiste will announce a couple of hundred jobs next week.  I hope that unlike decentralisation these jobs will come to fruition, but that is another day's work.There is a major question over the structures of the petrol companies.  The banks and the lack of leadership shown by them have been the talking point for the past few weeks, but there must be collusion in fixing the price of petrol and diesel.  I acknowledge there is a small difference in the prices.  I do not think price fixing is being organised at local level but rather by the companies.  Many of the people at the petrol pumps have gone out of business in recent years.  They are not the ones making a fortune but the big companies certainly are.  I ask that this be investigated.I have no major problem with the resolution on the price of tobacco and wine, considering the health implications of tobacco and the increased consumption of wine at home.County Monaghan certainly will not get any decentralisation and the barracks are to be closed.  For those people in the barracks the price of petrol or diesel will not be an issue.  The closure is an absolute scandal.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13096	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	408	On the price of tobacco, the Labour Party will support the measure on the basis that it will act as a deterrent.  However, in an effort to curb tobacco consumption, we should encourage people to use substitute products and allow those products to be free of VAT.  Products such as Nicorette should be delisted — as currently they can only be sold in pharmacies — and allowed to be sold in supermarkets and to a wider range of people.  I called for such a measure in the previous budget.  I suspect one of the things at play here is that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is firmly in control of that issue.  I take the measure at face value if it is a question of equity but it should be considered in a wider context if it is considered as a health measure.If I were an average Fianna Fáil voter, a male, who liked to back a horse, maybe enjoyed a glass of wine——

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I assure Deputy Sherlock one would not have to be a Fianna Fáil voter to be disappointed with this budget.  People are very disappointed because the most vulnerable in society have again been hit.  I am annoyed with the proposals for VAT, cigarettes and petrol.  The Minister went for the soft target with regard to VAT as it will hit a wide range of areas and many middle-income earners will be affected.  The poor and the vulnerable will also be affected.  The Ministers were thinking of their own comfort zone when this budget was being considered at Cabinet.  They do not have to go to the petrol pump and fill up the car because they have ministerial cars.  The Government is completely at sea.  I refer to the 8 cent per litre increase on petrol against a backdrop of rising prices for petrol.  I am surprised the Minister did not hit diesel prices as well.  The Government has not considered areas which would provide more money for the Exchequer.  The price of cigarettes will be increased by 50 cent and this is a health consideration and the price of a bottle of wine will be increased by 50 cent.  I ask the Tánaiste to say what action the Government has taken in recent years to curb under age drinking.  It has done nothing.  Will an extra 50 cent on cigarettes stop the teenager from smoking?  I do not think so.  The same number of teenagers will smoke tomorrow as did today.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Minister for Finance claimed that he is trying to build this economy and yet he introduced a VAT rate of 21.5%.  Aside altogether from low income and working families and the nature of the impact of this increase on that category of people — goodness knows, they are very hard hit in today's budget — the small business sector will be affected and it is already crucified with steep charges.  I see no encouragement for small business in these proposals and this is a regressive measure.  It is the wrong direction to take; the Government should have made a reduction in VAT to 20% or less rather than adding to that scourge of both the small business sector and low income families.  I note the resolution proposes that it shall take effect as and from 1 December 2008, so we do not even get Christmas out of it.  This is a case of bad Santa.  This is a regressive move which is most unfortunate.The additional cost of fuel and petrol is regressive.  It is an attack on workers who have no public transport because, by and large, public transport was neglected by this Government for all of these years.  Yet people are supposed to put their hands in their pockets and pay this additional cost.I note the Green influence in the Government is negated with the additional parking fees at Iarnród Éireann stations.  One is ripped off as soon as one goes in the gate to avail of fairly shoddy public transport.  The Government is having another go.  Somebody on that side of the House should say this is crazy.  I agree with Deputy Seymour Crawford's point about the significant custom given to Border petrol stations by people from the other side of the Border.  With the introduction of this measure, the days of lengthy queues at petrol stations in Border counties will be well and truly finished.  This is most unfortunate.  It will penalise people trying to travel to work who must drive because public transport is inadequate.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The increase in the standard rate of VAT from 21% to 21.5% will be punitive for a significant swathe of people who will find it increasingly difficult to afford the additional outlay they will be obliged to make in respect of consumables and their household needs.  This will not merely have the effect of discouraging further spending by people who come within the remit of the Exchequer.  Deputies Morgan and Crawford referred to the increase in the excise duty on petrol and while there has been a steady rise in sales at filling stations in this jurisdiction in recent years as a result of the differential between the price in the North and that which obtains in the South, the reality is that a significant number of people who live in counties immediately on this side of the Border now do their shopping in the North.  This is a fact of life.An increase in VAT will encourage people from Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth who shop in the Six Counties to continue doing so.  This increase is an incentive for those individuals to leave their local areas and travel north of the Border.  It is proposed in Financial Resolution No. 7 to increase the excise duty on petrol by 8 cent per litre, which will act as a disincentive for traffic from the Six Counties to travel south.  This will prove to be a double whammy to local economies in Border counties from Donegal to Louth.I am deeply concerned with regard to the effect the propositions in Financial Resolutions Nos. 4 and 7 will have.  The consequences will be extremely severe.  Financial Resolution No. 7 is unquestionably a tax on those who need to use their cars to travel to work.  There is no public transport infrastructure whatsoever in the Border counties and the overwhelming majority of people who live there need their cars in order to travel to work.  An 8 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol and a 4% increase in motor tax — dealt with in a later financial resolution — on all cars with engines below 2.5 litres will prove extremely punitive.  Ordinary people will find it not just difficult, but impossible to cope.  Financial Resolution No. 7 is a disincentive to work.The collective weight of all these measures will undoubtedly lead people to face the financial reality that, in light of the budget, they would be better off out of work rather than trying to maintain and sustain their families by remaining in employment.  I strongly oppose both financial resolutions.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Any increase in VAT will have a negative impact on business at a time when the latter can ill afford it.  Business has come through an extremely difficult time during the past 12 months, particularly in the context of increased oil prices, transport costs, etc.  To pile on something of this nature, which will impact on both consumers and those in the business sector, at this stage is hugely negative.  This is not a wise decision and I do not know why it was made.  It was indicated that the increase will lead to the accrual of €227 million in a full year.  That is a considerable sum.  When consumers realise the import of what is proposed, the Government will subjected to a reaction that will bear little resemblance to what it received from its backbenchers following the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement.I am a smoker and I must declare an interest in Financial Resolution No. 5.  Everyone welcomes the increase in the excise on tobacco.  However, I wish to highlight a matter to which previous speakers did not refer, namely, the old age pensioners who smoke and who received a miserable 3% increase as a result of the budget.  These people will lose that increase in its entirety when they buy one packet of cigarettes.  Elderly people like their comforts.  I accept that smoking may be a bad habit but it is a habit nonetheless.  I cannot understand what they have done wrong that they should be punished in this way.  Those on the Government benches will feel self-righteous about this matter but they should try to see the other side.  It will not be a laughing matter for those who will be directly impacted upon by this particular exercise.  The same applies, but not to the same extent, with regard to the increase in the duty on wine.The increase in the duty on mineral oils will bring in an additional €166 million in 2009.  That amount will increase thereafter.  Two issues arise in this regard.  First, unfortunate motorists are being treated as if there were an alternative mode of transport available to them

They are being treated that way but they are a necessity.  People who use their cars to travel to work and to drop their children to school or college will be hit hard by this provision.During the past couple of years, the price of diesel has been higher than that of petrol.  In a cunning way, the Government has decided to impose an increase in the duty on petrol because it is of the view that this will also drive up the price of diesel.  I cannot see what will stop the latter from happening.  The price of diesel has been greater than that of petrol for the past two or three years.  Does this increase mean that the prices will be brought level or will there be an automatic increase in the price of diesel?  Those in the transport sector and everyone else will be hammered if there are parallel increases in the price of both fuels.  The Tánaiste knows that will be the case.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The Minister for Finance has taken the baton from his predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and crashed straight into a wall.  The more I consider the macro figures, the more I understand why Ministers were whey-faced on their way in and out of Government Buildings during the past three weeks.  The position is disastrous.  The Government had a choice involving making expenditure cuts, doing something with the borrowing requirement and introducing tax increases.  In my opinion, it got the balance wrong and has chosen to raise taxation at every hand's turn by means of direct tax increases, levies, charges or whatever.  When the entire thrust of VAT is towards uniformity, I do not know how the Government can justify increasing the rate of VAT to 21.5%.  This move is almost impossible to defend.Deputy McManus reminded people on the opposite side of the House how expensive it has become to live in this country.  Most Members on the Government benches cannot remember when they last filled their cars with petrol on a filling station forecourt.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	426	It is beyond belief when one considers that 8 cent will be added to the price of a litre of petrol.  The price of oil is falling at present, partly as a result of the financial turmoil.  However, there has not been a commensurate decrease in the price charged for petrol and diesel at filling stations.  The Government is now going to drive the price up again by imposing this 8 cent increase.  People need their cars to travel to work or to bring their children to their places of education.  As Deputy Durkan stated, these people have no alternative and yet the Government is piling on increases willy-nilly.The Government is going to tip the economy over altogether.  For months it denied that the economy was in recession.  As the Tánaiste knows, we are now in recession and the Government will tip us over into a depression with the amount of money it is taking out of the economy through the options taken in this budget.Will the Tánaiste tell us the cumulative effect on the consumer price index of the group of resolutions before us?  What do they cost and what will they add to the CPI?   Will the Tánaiste explain how the betting tax will be collected and whether it is simply a doubling of the existing 1% charge?The tobacco and alcohol levies will make a significant enough contribution to the CPI but it would be hard to oppose those measures for arguments that are well known.  Representatives of the Irish Cancer Society were in the House recently and several of the Tánaiste's colleagues met them.  The representatives argued for a steeper increase in the tax on cigarettes.  I am very doubtful about the argument that was advanced to them about such a measure enhancing smuggling in the Republic.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	427	The budget hits a particular group of people who can ill afford to be hit with the type of increases the Government proposes.  The charge that will affect virtually everybody is the increase in VAT.  That increase, as well as the increase in the tax on petrol, suggests that petrol is a luxury item and that VAT is only applied to luxury goods, but that is not the case.  VAT is levied on clothing, footwear and many other everyday items and the increase will hit everyone.The combination of increases proposed here, namely the 8 cent increase on a litre of petrol, the increase in VAT and the €200 charge for a parking space, which is not in front of us now but which will be introduced and which will affect those who, for example, work in factories and are provided with car parking spaces, are harsh.  Taxes are being imposed on people on very limited incomes and they will only realise it next year.A total of €227 million will be raised by the Government through the increase in VAT, which is quite a significant sum.  The 1% levy on income is probably the one provision which none of us in Opposition can understand.  Had the Minister for Finance said that a 2% levy would be imposed on those earning above a certain threshold, that would be fine.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I ask the Deputy to deal with the financial resolutions that are currently before the House.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	429	However, the 1% levy will be applied to everyone's income, even those on minimal incomes, which is outrageous.The increases in VAT and petrol tax will bring in significant income for the Government but we are not sure what will happen to that income.  The implication of these increases is that they apply to luxury goods, which defies reason.  An increase in VAT at a time when people's incomes are being reduced is illogical.  An increase in the price of petrol when we do not have an adequate public transport system is difficult to understand.  When the full implications of this budget start to sink in, the average earner or the person who is unemployed and looking for work will be very annoyed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I gather from these resolutions that the Government has effectively abandoned any prospect of getting a pay agreement through the social partnership process.  This resolution is levelling an inflationary, regressive tax on the backs of  increasingly overburdened working people.  In that context, I must assume that is the Government's position on the pay agreement.On the basis of the figures supplied and subject to correction by officials, I calculate that we are looking at a 0.77% increase in the rate of inflation.  There is no figure given for the betting tax, but most of the figures relating to betting are works of elaborate fiction anyway.  It appears that the Government is determined to go down a regressive road.  The thinking behind this budget, as manifest in this resolution, indicates that the Government has failed the test.  This will not correct the main problem that we have, namely, the structural gap between revenue and expenditure.  The Government's temporary 10% cut in salary is simply a sop, with no reference  made to the postponed pay increase vis-à-vis pensions and salaries.The Government is dealing a major blow to the tourism industry by increasing costs.  That will affect the west in particular, which has become highly uncompetitive as a tourism destination.I ask the Tánaiste what the critical threshold was with regard to increasing the tax on tobacco.  The increase proposed is actually quite small.  With regard to smuggling and the criminality associated with it, I was given to understand that the Garda has had a handle on that for some time now and that the kind of smuggling that occurred eight or ten years ago has been dealt with.  Would the Tánaiste agree that the Government could have imposed a higher levy on cigarettes, given the extra resources and experience of the Garda in this area?While this is not directly relevant to the resolutions before us, I ask the Tánaiste to clarify an issue for the House.  I presume the €200 per year charge for a car parking slot will apply to these premises and to the entire Civil Service.  Will that mean that we will all have a designated car parking space?
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	431	It appears that not much thought went into the preparation of this budget.  The Government has taken the easy options, particularly in resolution No. 4 which increases VAT.  I will confine my remarks to resolution No.7, which imposes an 8 cent levy on a litre of petrol.Deputy Timmins asked how much of the price of a litre of petrol is tax and he was kindly answered by his constituency colleague.  Can the Tánaiste confirm that the figures cited are correct, namely that 55% of the price of every litre of petrol is tax?  The proposal in resolution No.7 is anti-rural.  Many of those who work in Galway city, for example, come from areas in Connemara including Clifden, Carraroe, Lettermullen and so forth.  They work in factories, hospitals, the health service, the local authority and so forth and will be penalised for using their cars to get to work.  Many travel between 30 and 50 miles per day and soon they will not be able to afford to travel to work.  It will be better for them to stay at home and go on the dole or engage in farming rather than travel to work in Galway city.  The €200 charge for a parking space will affect many of the same people.  Will those working in factories, for local authorities or in the health services be charged for parking?  Will the HSE be obliged to charge €200 to all of the people who crowd out the car park of the University College Hospital every day?  I ask the Tánaiste to clarify these matters in her response to our concerns about the 8 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol.  That increase will make it almost uneconomical for people who travel long distances to work to continue to do so.  This is particularly true in my constituency of Galway West where many of those who work in the city live up to 50 miles outside it.  Such people are being crucified.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I find it extraordinary that we should have such a blunt instrument in increasing VAT across the board in the manner proposed on the basis that this will add to inflation in 2009.  Is this factored into the Government's computations?  It is unfortunate that the Celtic tiger years did not treat the taxpayer or hard-pressed families any more favourably than to see VAT stay in its current form for the past number of years.  The highest it has ever been in the history of the State was 23%.  During the past number of years we heard from the Government benches about the success, the celebrations and the corking of the champagne bottles.  Now, VAT is on the rise again after a long number of years.  It is particularly regrettable that goods and services which are so important for families will be hit in this way.The 8 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol will have serious consequences, particularly for people commuting to Dublin.  People in my constituency bought into the developer's dream of moving down the country to purchase an affordable house while holding on to their jobs in Dublin.  These people will now fork out €100 per tank of petrol to get them to work or college.  Their houses on the outskirts of every town and village within a couple hours of Dublin are in negative equity, their jobs are on the line and the response of the Government is to burden them with further increases, in particular a cost on commuting to work.They have no choice given the absence of an alternative quality public transport.  The trains which pass up and down through my constituency are invariably late, overcrowded and utterly unreliable.  People have been forced back into their cars and are now faced with car parking charges, be they parking at the station at home or in Dublin.  The applause given to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, by his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches, the Green Party and the remaining Progressive Democrat will come back to haunt them in the not too distant future.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	435	What we are witnessing here is the type of economics written on the back of a cigarette box.  We saw it earlier with the calculations of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, on the reintroduction of third level fees.  We see it here again this evening with calculations made on a crisis-driven basis rather than with a strategic approach, particularly one to get the country out of the situation the Government to which has brought us.I will refer to the matters in hand, particularly the increase of VAT to 21.5 % and the 8 cent increase in the price of a litre of petrol.  This is a double whammy because the cost of petrol has increased and the increase of VAT to 21.5% is, in itself, an additional increase.  The Government is hoodwinking the public because they are not being hit with an 8 cent increase, but an 8 cent increase with an increase in VAT to 21.5% on top of it.What should have happened — let me make this clear because it has been a matter of record for some time — is that prior to the Government altering the VAT bands, it should have examined what is included in them.  I will give an example of an item which has increased in price, and prices are an extremely relevant issue for those who might be termed "Mr. and Mrs 1%" on the minimum wage who are affected by the budget.  Their cost of living has not only increased by 1% with the levy, but also by 0.5% in VAT.  This is a 1.5% automatic increase in the cost of living for people on the minimum wage as a result of the budget.A car owner with a child is legally required to place a safety seat in the car.  The VAT on this item has increased to 21.5%.  It should not be at the top rate of VAT.  In fact, it should not be subject to VAT at all because it is a legal requirement for a parent to have it in the car.

The community and voluntary sectors, which cannot claim back VAT, buy photocopying machines and equipment.  They will find their costs have increased as a result of this measure.  There was no examination of the VAT system; it was slapped on.  This is the back of a cigarette box economics and hence the cost of living has increased for community groups and those on the minimum wage.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	438	To say the least, this budget contains draconian measures.  The worst is the decision with regard to the medical cards for the over 70s which is unfair to the people concerned.  Another measure I consider harsh is the increase in third level registration fees.  To introduce such a large increase while we are conducting a review of the cost of third level education is a slap in the face to every parent and young child in the country.With regard to this resolution, I require clarification from the Minister on the changes made with regard to low level alcohol beer and cider, particularly with regard to cider as it affects my constituency.  We have a good story from the cider industry in Tipperary.  We have major investment in a modern plant which, for various reasons, has been under extreme pressure to make profits for the past number of years.

However, the Government also stated it intended to take €63 million extra out of our pockets for it.  When I stated this last year there were headlines that "Stagg proposes a €3 increase on packet of cigarettes".  If the Government was serious about applying this as a health measure, then the increase would be much greater.  Let us see this for what it is.  The increase represents what the traffic can bear and what will maximise the take for the Government.  It will bring in €105 million in one year.With regard to resolution No. 8, as Deputy Charles Flanagan stated, the Government's plans forced people out of Dublin——

It forced them there because it would not control land prices.  The price of housing was allowed to increase while planning was encouraged in these areas.  The Government party in particular was active in this regard.  Now, it will penalise them for travelling and they do not have public transport as an alternative.In my constituency, there is inadequate public transport to get to and from Dublin.  The Government has not done the work on the roads and when one gets near Dublin, the traffic stops.  One uses up what will be very expensive petrol in the traffic jams.  It will cost commuters coming to Dublin to work approximately €5 per fill, and one needs to fill twice per week to come from where I do in north Kildare.  This green envy tax will now affect those commuters coming into Dublin.  Out of pure envy and spite, the Green Party could not let it go and wants €200 from everyone who can park for free near their place of work.  This is nothing other than Green Party envy and should be labelled as such.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	492	There is a degree of equity in the pensions proposal in Financial Resolution No. 9.  However, it is interesting that the Government has failed to address certain pensions issues in the budget.  There has been a considerable drop in pension values.  Government policy over a number of years has been to encourage people to make proper provision for themselves upon retirement.  There are pension funds in existence that are worth 20% to 30% less than they were worth this time last year and this creates a particular difficulty for those who are 55 and over who envisage retiring between the ages of 60 and 65.  I am surprised the Government has made no special provision for this group.The focus in the resolution is entirely on recovering tax for the Revenue without addressing the broader social issue of the value of pension funds, the likely medium-term cost to the State of people whose funds are inadequate and the question of what is to happen this month and next month.  At the end of this month, the self-employed normally make their tax returns.  This month, they will make a supplemental pension payment for the tax year ending in December 2007.  They will be making an advance tax payment for the full year 2008 and I understand a pension contribution will be built into this.The difficulty at present is that, apart from reducing the tax reliefs for making pension payments, no provision has been made to encourage people, even those earning below €150,000, to provide adequately for pensions in the coming year.  Any self-employed person, or person in employment with a private pension scheme to which he makes additional contributions, putting money into a pension fund this October or November would do as well to fly to Las Vegas and bet the money at the roulette wheel.  No one knows what will happen with regard to the manner of the investment of funds, particularly with reference to stock markets or other types of financial products.  There is a particular problem here but there is a yawning silence from the Government on this issue, which I expected would be addressed in the budget.The issue runs over into what is happening with savings.  It is curious that DIRT is being increased from 20% to 23%.  My understanding of the purpose of that tax was to ensure that when people had money on deposit, and they fell into the standard rate of tax, the tax would be received by Revenue.  It allowed Revenue to keep track of what deposits were in existence.  If people fell into the higher rate of income tax, they then had to make up the difference.If one is paying 23% DIRT and one's tax rate is only 20%, will one be able to reclaim the 3% difference?  Is the Minister not creating a new layer of bureaucracy for savers?  In the context of the Government trying to encourage saving, is this not a direct discouragement to save in that if one is only on the standard rate of income tax, one will find that one's deposit savings are taxed at a higher rate?  Is this basically an admission by Government, if it was honest and referred to the levy as part of the income tax code, that the 1% levy has in practical terms moved the standard rate of tax to 23%?  Perhaps it means something different.  Does it mean simply that if one has savings, they do not fall into this category?  Perhaps this is the explanation for the manner in which this is being dealt with.  Does money earned by an individual by way of savings fall into the 1% levy?  Will a person pay an extra 1% as well as paying 23%?The Government would have been more honest if, in the context of the budget publication today, it had truthfully told the general public we are increasing the standard rate of tax to 23%.  The Tánaiste should clarify these points.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I do not take issue with Financial Resolution No. 9.  It is equitable that the figure is capped at a more reasonable amount than was the case up to now.  For many of the reasons Deputy Shatter advanced, it is desirable that people in those circumstances ought to have some incentive to provide for themselves in terms of their pension rights.It is interesting, though, that the Government has only decided to hit people who are earners or are self-employed in this category of people who would be making accelerated voluntary contributions, AVCs, and so on.  There is an entirely separate facility in the tax code to allow, say, a director of a company to put a very substantial amount of money into a pension fund when he or she is nearing retirement.  The company gets the benefit of a write-down of corporation tax and an amount of €250,000, or any figure one likes, can be put into the fund.  Companies can be engineered to facilitate this practice, yet the Minister does not bother touching this area in any way, although there have been gross abuses.  I would be very interested to hear what kind of cost to the Exchequer is estimated to result from the operation of that scheme, which is not touched.  I am not taking issue with the changes made in this resolution but I would like to know the answer to this question.The increase in DIRT is a mean, miserable imposition from what is now turning out to be a very mean, miserable and shocked Government.  We had a lecture from the Taoiseach before he departed, something that used not to happen in the time of Mr. Haughey, Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Bruton or Deputy Ahern.  The Taoiseach's lecture concerned the 26% rate in the time of the rainbow Government.  It would be just as relevant to this debate for me to tell the Tánaiste what happened when Seán McEntee was Minister for Finance.  The important point is that during that time there was an exemption, a threshold before one came to be taxed.  I assure the Tánaiste that before the Finance Bill goes through this House, the Government will be back with an exemption level for the 1% levy.To remain on this issue, the Taoiseach's big point before he left the House was that there was a 26% standard rate in the time of the rainbow Government.  This Government is now pushing DIRT up to 26%.  Why is it doing this?  This affects people who, by definition, paid tax before their money was put into some bank or building society.  The Government, mysteriously, did not bother to collect it for a large number of years — I know a little about that, and the inquiry concerned yielded €1 billion for the Exchequer, which it took gratefully.   Now the Government hikes up the rates to 23% and to 26%.  I cannot understand how we can have such a flurry about a former Minister for Finance encouraging people to save, yet here people who have paid their income tax as due will be liable to an additional increase in this regard.I do not take any issue with the motion on capital gains tax, except that I question the yield.  I would like the Minister or the Tánaiste to tell me where the Government proposes to raise this €160 million.  Was that the figure?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Is the Deputy referring to DIRT?

There is a figure of €160 million in a full year.  I would like to know where the expert advice available to the Government came from.  I hope nobody on the opposite side of the House has been playing golf with some dental economist.  Where will this €160 million come from?

Where will the €160 million come from?  Is somebody currently making money on shares or the disposal of property, or on something I do not know about?  I would like to hear the Minister or the Tánaiste tell us where those particular figures came from.The increase for bills of exchange and cheque books is, I suppose, neither here nor there.  Some of us still use them.  We are sorry if we are not up with the information age.  It seems we will pay the price.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I will consider the resolutions in order.  I join other Members in supporting Financial Resolution No. 9, which deals with the pensions issue.  The previous position was unnecessarily generous to high income earners and a threshold of €150,000 is totally acceptable.In general, I support all these resolutions.  The Government is acting correctly to stabilise the national finances and to do otherwise would be irresponsible.  However, there is a duty on me, as a Member of the Dáil, to point out things that may not actually work.  My first concern is with regard to Financial Resolution No. 10 and income tax.  People are now very flexible with their money.  There are many markets throughout Europe and elsewhere where money can be invested, and many ways to invest.  The Minister will agree it has always been a policy of every Government to encourage people to save.  I am concerned that the more the rate of DIRT is raised, the more people will be disincentivised to save.Does this measure apply to the post office?  If it applies fully to post office savings, then again there is no incentive for people to put money into the post office.  There is an argument for encouraging people to put money into a State or semi-State institution.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte, but he appeared to say that all the money in deposit accounts is earned money, but that is not quite true.  There could be money on deposit that is not earned income.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Yes, there could.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	502	Unearned income deserves to be taxed, given the state of the national finances, but this should be a temporary measure.  At 20%, DIRT is too high.  We should encourage people to save.  If we do not, we are encouraging people to consume, to spend their money rather than save it.  That is not a good idea.I wish to make a similar point on capital gains tax.  I support the measure on a temporary basis because we have little choice.  We all recall that capital gains tax used to be 40% and the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, reduced it to 20%.  When he did that, he hugely increased the tax take from capital gains tax.  Similar to the DIRT issue, the more one raises capital gains tax the less people are inclined to take risks or dispose of their property, shares or whatever and one runs the risk that the tax take may go down.Will the Tánaiste indicate whether the sum of €160 million is in addition to the normal take or if it is the total take from capital gains tax?  I agree with what Deputy Rabbitte said.  The take on capital gains in the next two or three years will be abysmally low.  I think I am correct in saying one can bring forward losses indefinitely.  In the past year or 18 months I estimate that tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people have made large capital losses and they will be bringing them forward.  I fear that the take from capital gains will be very small.  However, I am not sure the Minister had an option.  Given the overall financial circumstances he probably did have to increase the tax, but if the net effect is to decrease the tax take then it might be a self-defeating item.The rationale for the increase in capital gains tax given in the Budget Statement was a good one.  The Minister for Finance specifically outlined that it was to decrease the rate of commercial property stamp duty from 9% to 6%.  That is a laudable move because many people were simply not developing properties or buying commercial properties because the 9% rate of stamp duty was absolutely exorbitant.  I support the measure in the sense that it has made possible that decrease in stamp duty.  I also support it on the basis that it had to be done given the overall state of the national finances.The capital gains tax increase should be only a temporary one.  As soon as economic conditions improve the rate should be reduced to 20% or even less.  We all know what a competitive environment there is for capital and if Ireland is not at the edge of the competition there is no future for us.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I wish to raise many issues in the income tax sections but they can wait until we have more time during the debate on the Finance Bill.  The pension provision looks reasonable in resolution No. 9.  It is difficult to know what provision an elderly person should make for their pension.An issue arose today with the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, on nursing home charges and the provision a person should make in the case of his or her being reliant on a pension so as not to be an undue burden on his or her relatives.  Nursing home charges cost €60,000 to €70,000 per year in Dublin and €40,000 to €50,000 elsewhere in the country.  Up to today's budget, if an individual or family were paying that cost they would have received tax relief at the marginal rate of tax.  In other words——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	504	That has not been changed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I will be very brief.  If somebody was paying €60,000 a year — that is not unusual in this city — he or she would expect to get approximately €24,000 back if he or she were taxed at the marginal rate of tax.  On the basis of the Government's intent, that would be reduced to €12,000.  That is a massive imposition on a vulnerable section of society.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, assured me in RTE today — modulated by Miriam O'Callaghan — that this was never the Government's intention and that it would not apply.  When I met the Minister for Finance in the corridor this afternoon he assured me there was no intention to do that either.  My problem is that when I checked the summary of budget measures I noted on page B.6 under health expenses relief, "Health expenses relief will be granted at the standard rate only from 1 January 2009, with the exception of nursing home expenses which will be standard rated from 1 January 2010."  If it was not the Government's intention to do that, how did it get into the summary of the budget?  Now that I have it in print in front of me, that what I say will apply from 1 January 2010, can I still accept in good faith — as I did — the commitments of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan?  I hope the Tánaiste can give that assurance to the House tonight.  Can she explain to me how this got into the summary of the budget if the Government never made the decision?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Two different items in this group of resolutions trouble me.  One is the increase in DIRT.  No exemption is provided.  Most people lodge their savings after tax.  What they earn on those savings is not a gift from the Government — it is not a gift from anyone — it is interest made on the basis that a bank has the use of one's money while it is on deposit.  One pays tax before the money is deposited.  The Government does not add anything to it while it is in the bank and when it comes back out the Government taxes it again, in this instance at 23%.  That is outrageous.  We are talking about small savers here.  Given the recent and current turmoil with the banks, surely we should try to impress on people the need to be responsible with their money?  We should be trying to impress on people that one cannot have instant credit for everything and that one should save and make provision for one's needs.  This measure will not do that because people simply will not see the benefit of saving.The notion that one would try to drive people away from using cheque books to using credit cards is beyond me, especially in the current climate.  When one writes a cheque and hands it over to someone, it is almost a written statement that one has sufficient money in one's account to cover the cheque.  It is a statement of responsibility in regard to finances.  Any one of us could walk out the door to find a queue at a bank ATM.  It is not called painless money for nothing.  One sticks a card into a machine and the money comes out.  The transaction is painless. That level of non-thinking withdrawal of cash is now being discouraged.  In most countries in Europe it is an offence to write a cheque when one knows one does not have the means to cover it.  If one does so in France, for instance, it is illegal to write another cheque for at least 12 months until one becomes responsible for one's deposit account.  Surely that is the type of responsibility we need to encourage or is this another measure to ensure banks need not do the paper work they should have been doing all along?  It is outrageous that such measures are being introduced which encourage people not to be responsible with their financial affairs.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I refer to Financial Resolution No. 9 dealing with tax relief on pensions.  I broadly agree with the approach adopted in this resolution, but I have some questions.  That the limit is being introduced is an admission on behalf of the Government and the Pensions Board that the pensions policy pursued in recent years is an utterly failed policy.  It facilitated rich people to put by money to ensure their retirement fund would provide them with an income which would keep them in the standard to which they had become accustomed.  The policy did little or nothing to ensure people on middle or lower incomes were protected against poverty in their old age.  Consider what was happening up to now with tax relief on pensions.  There has been an extraordinary system in terms of redistributing wealth upwards to the better off, and it has been extremely regressive.Consider the most recent figures available.  Approximately 6,000 people who earned in excess of €250,000 availed of the maximum possible relief.  These people were stashing away almost €50,000 and getting €20,000 in tax relief every year.  There is no justification for this whatsoever.  People earning more than €250,000 are welcome to do whatever they like to provide for their retirement, but there is no reason why the taxpayer should subsidise them.  Such people were being given tax relief of €20,000, which is the equivalent of being handed €20,000 every year and double the State old age pension.  It is an intolerable situation and impossible to defend on any grounds of equity.While I welcome the introduction of the earnings ceiling of €150,000, why did the Government not go further in that regard?  The proposals could have saved in excess of €100 million.  It could have brought the earnings limit down to €130,000 and saved an extra €56 million.  Most people would agree it would have been fair to have an individual earnings limit of €100,000, which is more than generous.  The Government could have saved €287 million if it decided to be fair in its approach on pensions.  This would have allowed for those on the lowest incomes up to the average industrial wage to be taken out of the tax net in respect of the levy.  Instead, the Government has allowed those who are pretty well off, with incomes of more than €100,000 up to €150,000, to continue to get tax relief at the top rate.  Rather than touch these people it is now penalising people with very low incomes with the 1% levy.Earlier I asked the Tánaiste privately if this levy applies to community employment earnings.  It would seem from the briefings available that it does apply, which is scandalous.  These schemes include people on the very lowest rung of the employment ladder, trying to improve their skills to enable them to enter the open market soon.  The Government is now going to tax such people with the 1% levy on the meagre allowances they are paid for community employment schemes.  This makes no sense whatsoever and there is no argument for it on equity grounds.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13096	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I refer to the stamp duty on cheques and bills of exchange.  While many people engage in on-line banking and make electronic payments, we have not reached the stage where the bulk of people make such payments by those means.  The facilities do not exist in the community or the commercial sector.  For example, if one goes to a builders' providers it is not always possible to make electronic payments.  This is an unfair measure, especially for older people who still rely on the use of a cheque book.  This is a sneaky way to raise a few bob.Let us suppose a person has a mortgage and there is a life assurance policy tacked on to that mortgage.  Is that person susceptible to the proposed increase vis-à-vis life assurance and investment funds?  This would have the net effect of increasing the cost of mortgages for a certain sector.  It is proposed that this would yield €13 million per year.  I seek clarification on this matter.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I refer to Financial Resolution No. 10 dealing with deposit interest retention tax.  This is an extraordinary measure given the emphasis in the past few weeks on the need to encourage savings with the banks, to address the issue of liquidity in the banking system and the measures the Government had to take to address those issues in another arena.  A penalty of 3% is being imposed on people for doing the right thing, a disincentive to save.  The rate of interest that the unfortunate people will get is very small at present in any event.  Will this measure yield €72 million in a full year?  Will the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, indicate in these straitened times — I realise it is funny and perhaps it is a laughing matter as far as the Government is concerned — how serious the Government is about savings?  This is a serious issue.

If we are to change anything more fundamental, we will do so in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions.  The Commission on Taxation is looking at a number of these issues, including the issue of pension provision for directors, which was raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  There will be no change in the self-employed pension payment for the year 2007-08.  The change relates to next year.

This is a first step.  In my view, it is a matter of equity.  Having listened to what the Members of the House had to say, I believe they are quite happy with the provisions which have been proposed.  On the issue of DIRT——

The majority of people will accept that the issue has been dealt with.  I wish to speak about DIRT.  The one thing I believe about DIRT is that it is charged on interest.  Therefore, if the interest is low, 23% of low will still be low.

I am acutely aware of this issue.  The Minister for Finance is considering the introduction of a national payment implementation plan.  These issues need to be dealt with.  We have done a great deal of work to encourage and facilitate the electronic transfer of funds.  Further work needs to be done by banking and lending institutions to facilitate the transfer of moneys from one institution to another.  All of these matters will have to be considered in the context of the national pay-out implementation plan.  We are trying to encourage the use of cards.  As a consequence, there has been a reduction in the stamp duty charges imposed in respect of ATM cards and other debit cards.  A balance needs to be struck.

The fund is also supplemented with a financial contribution from central Government.The proposed increases announced today are 4% for cars below 2.5 litres and CO2 bands A to D; and 5% for cars above the 2.5 litre threshold and CO2 bands E, F and G.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Rates on goods and other vehicles will also increase by 4% with no increase for electric vehicles.  Trade plate licences will also increase by 4%.The new rates will apply to motor tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.  The increases maintain the strong incentive in the motor tax system, which this Government introduced last year, to switch to lower emission cars when purchasing new vehicles.  While increasing any tax is not popular it should be noted that motor tax increases since 2000, including the increase now before the House, are below the inflation rate over the intervening eight year period.  It is anticipated the proposed increases in motor tax rates will raise €40 million extra for local government next year.On the experience of three months' cars sales since the new VRT and motor tax systems came into effect we are already beginning to see a strong trend towards the purchase of new cars with lower emissions.

However, the tax changes were also introduced on a second principle of revenue neutrality.  I intend to keep the motor tax system under review, in consultation with the motor industry, to ensure it meets these twin objectives over future years.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	599	What about bicycles?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	600	However, the funding of local government must be broadened if it is to be sustained.  As set out in the Green Paper on Local Government, which I published last April, I am strongly of the belief that we need to strengthen the role of local government in Ireland.  The institutional and political reforms to be included in the forthcoming White Paper need to be accompanied by reforms of local government funding.  We have begun that process with the new measures to broaden the revenue base of local government announced in today's budget.I will now highlight for the House the impact of the proposed changes for private cars and goods vehicles.  These vehicles make up more than 91% of the national fleet.  For private cars taxed on the basis of engine size the extra cost for most motorists will be between €7 and €13 a year — that is between 13 cent and 25 cent a week.  This relates to more than 50% of the national car fleet which is made up of cars under 1400 cc.  For the remainder of the car fleet up to two litre the annual increases will be from €14 to €24 and from two litre upwards an additional €30 to €75 per year.  In summary, the extra costs for 94% of the car fleet, that is those under two litres, will be between 13 cent and 46 cent a week.For private cars on the new CO2 based system, bands A to D will see an annual increase of between €4 and €17, while for bands E, F and G the annual increases range from €30 to €100.  For goods vehicles the effect of the 4% increase will vary depending on the weight of the vehicle.  However, I emphasise that 87% of goods vehicles are at the lowest level of charge, meaning owners will pay an annual increase of €11 or 21 cent per week.A 4% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates, used by motor traders on vehicles temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles.  The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €12.  This financial resolution will cease on the enactment of the relevant Bill, which will be presented to the House at the earliest possible date.

He is asking local councils and councillors to impose more charges and hike up commercial rates paid by small business people to balance the books for his incompetence in not securing the necessary funds from the Department of Finance.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Minister had his chance to speak and I did not interrupt him.  I want to confirm that what the Minister proposes in conjunction with his colleagues shows his total contempt for the motorist.  However, the Minister is in favour of the cyclist.  A new initiative will be introduced for the cyclist while the motorist is hammered in the process.  We rest our case on this side of the House as to where the Minister's loyalty lies.  I know he has a personal interest in this matter.  However, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I would have expected him to confirm an additional initiative on emissions for motor vehicles.  The Minister could have proposed, but failed to do so, in the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act earlier this year to backdate some of the VRT changes for second-hand cars.  The driver file contains all the information needed to do that.The Minister, however, is out of touch with what is happening in the motor trade.  There are millions of euro worth of used cars lying idle in every motor sales garage because of the incompetent manner in which he implemented the VRT changes.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Minister is not good at understanding what is happening in the motor trade.  Rather than increasing local government funding with this proposal, there will instead be a reduction in the tax take as I warned last year.  The Minister fails to understand that the changes he made to VRT are not contributing to enhancing the amount of moneys going to local government.  No car sales are taking place; forecourts are full of used cars.  Figures from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry demonstrate a massive reduction in the number of used cars being sold.I support the Minister's aim in changes to VRT.  However, he introduced the scheme on 1 July 2008, when consumer behaviour and practice should have informed him that 1 January is when people make up their minds on purchasing new vehicles.  Unfortunately, common sense has not prevailed.  The Minister is making another grab for cash.  There will be an additional financial burden on goods vehicles at a time when their owners are under pressure to make ends meet because of the enhanced costs imposed by the Government over the past several years.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	625	It is not entirely the Minister's fault.  His predecessors have also brought about a rapid deterioration in the competitiveness of the economy and difficulties in the costs for small businesses.  Fine Gael will not support a measure that is simply a grab for cash without any reform.  The measure will take more money out of consumers' pockets, particularly when an average of €2,000 will also be taken out of workers' pockets with today's 1% income levy.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The Minister has acknowledged this is just a money-raising measure while at the same time trying to play the green card, as he did last year.  To get the benefit of the new rating introduced in July, one has to be in the position to buy a new car.  The point I made on last year's budget still applies.  When the Minister talks about changing driver behaviour, he is actually talking about changing consumption behaviour.  Instead of buying one product, it just encourages people to buy another product.  If one has the money, one can buy a new car.  I note there is no increase in the tax on electric cars.  Most people will not have the luxury of being able to buy one of these cars.The tax on vehicles, however, used for the carriage of eight or more persons which are used exclusively by youth or community organisations will be increased.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	628	An increase will be imposed on large public service vehicles which are used only for the carriage of children.  If the Minister was serious about a green measure, those are the class of vehicles which should have had their motor taxes reduced.The 8 cent increase on petrol is actually the carbon tax which the Minister referred to in his survey on carbon taxes earlier in the year.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	629	That is correct.  It is phase 1 of its introduction.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The Minister has disassociated himself from that particular carbon tax.  Why?  It is because it will place a large burden on the average family.  For all the talk about carbon taxes, the Minister will not admit to the very carbon tax in this budget.As a Green Party Minister, if he really wanted to tackle carbon emissions from the transport sector, why is the Minister allowing the Department of Transport to make Dublin Bus take buses off the road?  Why was that not his bottom line when he entered government?  Why did he not make his priority putting more buses on the road, instead of measures such as this which are simply about raising revenue?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I can only describe this as a punitive tax.  It is aimed at the many people who have either no or poor access to public transport services.  It is aimed at small cars, engines under 2.5 litres, owned mainly by low-income families struggling to get to their place of work.  They are probably thankful they still have a job and recognise they are under significant threat.  No provision was made in the budget for dealing with public transport.  The Minister, as Deputy Hogan said, has used smash and grab tactics to take money from low-income earners.  It is disgraceful.We all recognise that local government needs funding.  It has not received proper funding since 1977 which has not been fixed by any Government since.  An effort should have been made to correct that dearth of funding for local government, not putting it on the backs of those with small motor vehicles who use them to get to work.The Green Party has abandoned rural Ireland and those in satellite towns around Dublin city who regard their cars as a necessity to get to work because of the disgraceful provision of public transport.Whatever about the change on the road to Damascus, there was some scandalous change on the road to Government Buildings by the Green Party.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	632	It was sickening.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I am glad the Minister has admitted this measure is nothing more than a grab for local government funding.  He was clearly not successful in his budget negotiations.  An Oireachtas committee, of which Deputy Hogan was a member, sat for two years investigating the high cost of car insurance.  The tax on cars now costs more than insurance cost two years ago.  It is outrageous and I do not understand how the Government believes people can afford it.  If the Minister knew anything about how the motor trade operates, last December he would not have announced a change in VRT to be introduced in July.  The repercussions of that decision were seen in Cork recently with the loss of many jobs in the industry.Whoever is advising the Minister on motor tax must have written this paragraph in the Budget Statement.  It states:From 1 January 2009, the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers to employees who agree to use the bicycles to cycle to work will be treated as a tax exempt benefit-in-kind.  The exemption may only apply once in any five year period in respect of any employee.  There will be a limit on the value of such purchases of €1,000 for each employee.  The scheme may also be implemented via salary sacrifice arrangements, [that is a new one] whereby an employee agrees to forego part of his or her salary to cover the costs associated with the purchase of the bicycle and associated safety equipment.  Where such salary sacrifice arrangements are implemented, they must be completed over a maximum period of 12 months.In my language, and that of anyone else I have asked, this means the Minister is offering to pay people with a bike.  Forget people's salary, we will give them bikes.  Not only will they get a bike, we will decide what colour it is because obviously different employers will have different colours.  It will probably have a logo.  As for the safety equipment, where would one be without a bell on one's bike?  What about a lamp?  What about a dynamo or bicycle safety clips?

The measure is anti-rural, as the Minister does not seem to realise that in cities such as Galway people must commute from Clifden, Lettermullen, Carraroe and various other places.  It would be a nice thing to ask them to come in on a windy day on a bike from Lettermullen.  If the Minister has ever been on that road, he will know what I am talking about.

Will the block support grant to local authorities be kept up to the level of inflation?  If the Minister is genuine about local government, will the extra money raised by the new budgetary proposals be given to local authorities?  He says he wants to improve local authority services and while that is a debate for another day, he will have a big job on his hands to improve them.  Local authority services have deteriorated significantly.  One cannot get anybody to answer telephones, return calls or reply to letters.  When we call, we are told that programme managers are out and nobody knows when they will be back.  The situation is impossible but we will have this debate on another day as there is not enough time now.  I want to know, however, if the block grant to local authorities will be kept in line with inflation.

Deputies O'Rourke and Kelly from my constituency promised that the rail link between two gateway towns, Athlone and Mullingar, would be opened up.  We were also told the rail link in Killucan would be opened up, but nothing has happened.  There is nothing in the programme for Government, as all the proposed ideas have been abandoned.  The Government has carried on in a shameful manner.  Now it is closing the barracks in Longford, which is vital to the local economy.

A number of valuable projects, such as the western rail corridor, the Navan line, metro west and the Luas link-up, have been shafted.

In August, the number of new private cars registered fell by over 30%.

The terms of reference of the Task Force included the preparation of a comprehensive framework for renewal of the Public Service, and to recommend, in particular, how best to secure;an overarching policy for an Integrated Public Service, that enables increased flexibility, mobility and staff development; and supports the competencies and practices necessary for new networked ways of working within and across the broader Public Service; andthe basis for determining the contribution which a Senior Public Service could make to an integrated and cohesive Public Service.In addition, the Task Force was asked to develop an implementation plan, specifying the tasks and responsibilities necessary for the successful implementation of the renewal agenda, including the ways in which the principle of partnership with public servants and their representatives will be applied.The Task Force has met on several occasions to date and I look forward to receiving its report shortly.  Its work has been extensive, and has included engaging with a number of key stakeholders concerned with the shape of the successful implementation of the renewal agenda.

At the invitation of the U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, world leaders took stock of achievements already made, acknowledged what remains to be done and re-energised their commitments to meeting the MDGs.  During the meeting I made an intervention, focused on the topic of poverty and hunger and re-affirmed Ireland's commitment to the MDGs.I participated in a lunchtime round table discussion co-chaired by Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark and President Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, and including the U.N. Secretary General, on the theme of MDG 3 — Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment.While in New York, I also launched the Government's Hunger Task Force Report in the presence of the U.N. Secretary General and members of the Task Force including former Minister for Agriculture Joe Walsh, Jeffrey Sachs and Bono. The Hunger Task Force was established last year to look at ways in which Ireland could best deliver genuine progress and a sustainable impact in the fight against hunger. I also met with Bob Geldof on the margins of this launch.During my visit I also had meetings with European Commission President Barroso and former U.S. President Bill Clinton.

It is expected that this list will be compiled shortly and that the most burdensome obligations will be identified for measurement before the end of the year.This is in line with the overall effort to measure and reduce administrative burdens across Government. When the measurement has been completed, a simplification plan will be prepared detailing how a reduction in the burden on business can be achieved, thereby contributing to the Government's overall target of reducing administrative burdens on business by 25% by 2012.In June of this year, the CSO published a report detailing the burden placed on businesses by many of its surveys, the Report on Response Burden placed on Irish Businesses by CSO Inquiries, which is available on the CSO website. It is planned to extend the scope of this report and publish it on an annual basis.

Training courses for jobseekers are also listed on the FÁS Jobs Ireland website.The Jobseeker Directory provides aids such as A-Z of Careers, Creating a CV Online and Interview Tips along with information on Work Permits and Employment Rights.The EURES job mobility database provides access to job vacancies in 29 countries, as well as, practical information such as necessary documentation.  In addition FÁS provides a range of social inclusion programmes targeted at specific groups.FÁS Employment Service is currently integrating the network of Job Clubs which are located around the country into its service.  The aim of this integration is to support "job ready" clients through the provision of a ‘drop in' service and formal inputs, to identify job opportunities, complete application forms, letters of application and prepare for interviews.Unemployed people and job changers can and do engage with FÁS Employment Services without any formal appointment to seek information, advice and to source job vacancies, training programmes and other available FÁS supports.Formal intervention with people who are unemployed for 3 months takes place through the Employment Action Plan (EAP).  The Department of Social and Family Affairs makes arrangements for unemployed people to be referred to FÁS Employment Services which acts as the "Gateway" to all FÁS programmes, services and supports.An independent evaluation of the EAP process in 2005 by Indecon Consultants, concluded that the process was an overall success in promoting earlier exit from unemployment than would otherwise have occurred.  The consultants estimated that this was resulting in annual Exchequer savings of €34m (at 2004 prices) when all of the costs and benefits of the process were taken into account.The following tables contain an analysis of the EAP referrals for 2007 and for the period January-July 2008.

On the basis of the information available via the Committee, it would appear that this is a matter between the former miners and their former employers and insofar as the State may be concerned, a matter for further consideration under the social welfare code governing the State's disability and occupational illness benefit schemes.The allegations regarding the policy of the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965 are, to the best of my knowledge, unproven. In any event, the legal advice available to me, is that the mere existence of statutory regulation in a specific sector does not, of itself, impose any duty of care on the State in relation to the employees in that sector.  The matter of compensation to former miners is, consequently, not a matter for my Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the 3 year CE capping was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April, 2000). This was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain or return to CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.For a person to be considered for re-entry to Community Employment 12 months need to have elapsed since any previous participation and he/she must have been on the Live Register for that 12 month period. This is entirely subject to the availability of places, local demand and equity of opportunity to eligible long term unemployed people.In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.

The recent Review and Transitional Agreement under Towards 2016, which has yet to be ratified, recognises that the Public Service must review continuously its systems, processes and procedures, to ensure that it is responsive and efficient and that it provides high quality, value for money services.  Existing commitments under Towards 2016 will continue to be progressed in this agreement along with additional commitments in the Review and Transitional Agreement.  The arrangements whereby the payment of increases is dependent on the verification of satisfactory achievement of modernisation commitments, including improvements in performance and productivity, will also continue in the new agreement.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The Government decided on 8th July last that no further expenditure on the acquisition of accommodation for decentralisation should be sanctioned pending detailed consideration by the Government of two reports: one from the Decentralisation Implementation Group on the feasibility of phased moves by the State Agencies; and one from the Decentralisation Sub Group of the SMI Implementation Group of Secretaries General on the governmental and cross-Departmental issues arising from the need to provide facilities for Ministers, Ministers of State and officials while in Dublin on business. The Government has considered these two reports and I expect to make a further announcement in relation to the decentralisation programme shortly.

Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.

The project is at the initial stages of planning. Proceeding with the project to construction will depend on the availability of funding.

The meeting was held in the Department of Finance on the 29th September 2008 as part of the normal Pre Budget consultation process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I have no responsibility as Minister for Finance for directly committing or sanctioning particular construction projects. This is a matter for the Departments concerned.In relation to the cost plus form of contract, new Public Works fixed price lump sum contracts came into effect on 19 February 2007.  As part of that arrangement a transitional period was included to deal with a number of projects in the pipeline that had advanced designs based on the use of the old contracts.  These were allowed proceed on the old basis because to change over to the new contracts at that stage could have caused undue delay with project delivery.  This transition period came to an end on 13 February, 2008 with the issue of the Department of Finance Circular 04/08 which states that contracts for all projects (other than those with a value of €500,000 or less tendered before 3 March, 2008) must from the date of that Circular (13 February, 2008) be awarded using the New Public Works Contracts or the Conditions of Engagement for Consultants.  Therefore, use of the old forms of contract in delivering major new public service construction projects ceased from that date.However, in order to deal with a specific further transitional problem, I extended the 13 February deadline date by a short period to 6 May, 2008 for tenders received before that date.  This allowed a number of critical water services projects and a small number of school projects to proceed on the basis of the old contracts so that an undue delay in project delivery would not arise and the need to re-tender at possible extra cost would be avoided.This was a once-off extension of the derogation and it will not affect the implementation of the new forms of construction contracts going forward.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	722	I assume the Deputy is referring to the International Finance Corporation (IFC) which is a longstanding component of the World Bank group and was established in 1956, some 12 years after the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. I am informed that the role of the IFC is to foster sustainable economic growth in developing countries by financing private sector investment, mobilising capital in the international financial markets, and providing advisory services to businesses and governments.The question as to whether or not the IFC has a role to play in relation to the international financial markets situation is a matter for that body and the World Bank to consider in the first instance.As the Deputy will be aware the annual meetings of the Bretton Woods Institutions took place last weekend.  Communiqués from those meetings are available on the websites www.imf.org and www.worldbank.org.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The stamp duty relief for first time buyers is provided for in section 92B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the term "first time purchaser" is defined in the section.  In the definition, a first time purchaser is referred to as a person who has not previously purchased a house or a part of a house or previously built a house on his or her own behalf.  In addition, a first time purchaser is a person who has received a gift of a house after 22 June 2000 or received a gift of part of a house after 27 June 2000.To qualify for relief, the purchaser or purchasers must declare that they have not purchased property previously and that they will occupy the property for at least two years.  Where a property is purchased jointly, each purchaser must satisfy the conditions in order to qualify for first-time buyers exemption.  This position has existed since the first-time buyers exemption was introduced.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	724	As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is coordinating the overall process to measure and reduce burdens on business.  My Department is participating in this process and is currently compiling a list of information obligations in relation to the legislation for which it has responsibility. The timeframe for the completion of the identification, prioritisation and measurement of information obligations is end 2009. The position in relation to Revenue is similar.Quite apart from this process, Revenue has already introduced many simplification measures designed to ease the compliance burden for business and this has been acknowledged by business representatives.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	726	There are seven EU Directives and one Regulation awaiting transposition into Irish law by my Department at the current time.Directive 2007/74/EC, which was signed on 20th December 2007, replaces earlier provisions (Directive 69/169/EEC), adapting it to the enlarged EU whilst restructuring it and simplifying certain provisions. Current tax exemptions for VAT and excise duties applied to goods being brought into the EU by persons travelling from third countries will be amended. In addition there will be new limits on the quantities of tobacco products and alcohol that can be imported. This Directive will be transposed by way of Statutory Instrument, and I expect it to be transposed by the due transposition date of 1st December 2008.Directive 2007/44/EC establishes a harmonised legal framework setting out the entire procedure to be applied by competent authorities when assessing acquisitions on prudential grounds in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA). This Directive will apply to the acquisitions of credit institutions, insurance undertakings, assurance undertakings, reinsurance undertakings, investment firms, and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) management companies. It was formally adopted on 5 September 2007 and is due for transposition on 20th March 2009. This Directive will be transposed by Statutory Instrument, and I expect that it will be transposed by the due date.Directive 2007/64 (Payment Services Directive) establishes a harmonised legal framework for payments services in the EU/EEA. This Directive was formally adopted on 13th November 2007, and is due for transposition on 1st November 2009. This Directive will be transposed by Statutory Instrument, and I expect that it will be transposed by mid-2009.Directive 2008/55/EC codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures. This Directive was formally adopted on 26th May 2008, and was due for transposition on 30th June 2008. It will be transposed by Statutory Instrument and is currently at legal drafting stage.  I anticipate that this Directive will be transposed in early 2009.Directive 2007/66/EC aims to improve the effectiveness of review procedures concerning the award of public contracts and reflects interpretation of the existing Remedies Directives by the European Court of Justice. It strengthens the rights of bidders in challenging award decisions and introduces measures to combat contracts awarded in breach of the public procurement rules. This Directive was formally adopted on 11th December 2007, and is due for transposition on 20th December 2009. It will be transposed by Statutory Instrument, and I expect its transposition to be completed by mid-2009.Directive 2008/8/EC, which was signed on 12th February 2008, provides a package of new VAT arrangements for cross-border business-to-business (B2B) services from 1 January 2010, and, subject to a feasibility study, from 1 January 2015 for business-to-consumer (B2C) services in respect of telecoms, broadcasting and electronic services. The new B2B and B2C arrangements are based on shifting the place of taxation for services to the Member State of the consumer. Transposition of this Directive will be made by amending primary legislation — VAT Act 1972 — through Ministerial Regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  These Regulations will be made in the early part of 2009.Directive 2008/9/EC, which was formally adopted on 12th February 2008, provides detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC, to taxable persons not established in the Member State of refund but established in another Member State.  The Directive shall apply to refund applications submitted after 31 December 2009. This Directive will be transposed by amending both primary and secondary legislation, the VAT Act and Revenue Commissioner's Regulations, through Ministerial Regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.  These Regulations will be made by the due transposition date of 1st January 2010.Regulation 1082/2006 came into force on 1 August 2007 and allows for the establishment of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) which, in effect, allows bodies who are set up for the specific purposes of engaging in cross border cooperation to have a legal personality and be regarded as a Small and Medium Enterprise. It will be transposed by Statutory Instrument and is currently at legal drafting stage.  I anticipate that this Regulation will be transposed before the end of this year.The Office of Public Works (OPW) is managing the transposition of Directive 2007/60/EC, which was signed on 23rd October 2007, and is due for transposition on 25th November 2009. This Directive provides a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks, aiming at the reduction of adverse consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity associated with floods in the Community. It provides for the preparation and regular review of flood hazard maps, flood risk maps and flood risk management plans. OPW officials are in discussion with officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, regarding the transposition of the Directive and it has yet to be determined whether the Directive will be transposed by secondary legislation or whether primary legislation will be required.I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made in my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that Directives are transposed on time.

Weekly payments are being made to the sheriff and following a recent review of the level of payment the sheriff is satisfied, for the time being, with the current level of weekly payments. Revenue has been advised by the sheriff that the person concerned has not been placed on a seizure call list.

The person in question is not the assessable spouse in this case and therefore the P21 did not issue in her name but in the name of her spouse.A duplicate P21 was issued by the Revenue Commissioners, but this is also in the spouse's name.  If the person named requires a P21 in her own name, she should contact Mr Jim Fanning, Revenue House, Blackpool, Cork, telephone 021-6027257.

The person in question is in receipt of a UK pension that cannot be taxed under PAYE, and is dealt with under the Income Tax system in the same way as all non-PAYE income.If the person wishes to discuss their tax affairs they may contact Mr Con Murphy, Kerry Tax District, Tralee, Co Kerry, telephone 066-7161130.

The CSO has sole responsibility for deciding the statistical methodology to be used and is independent in its decisions. Any proposed changes are therefore a matter for the CSO.I would however draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that a consumer price index excluding tobacco products is currently published by the CSO on a monthly basis.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	733	I should explain that Nicorette sublingual tablets, Nicorette Inhalers and Nicorette chewing gum are chargeable to VAT at the zero rate. The basis for the zero rating of these products is that they come within paragraph (xiii) of the Second Schedule to the VAT Act 1972 as "medicine of a kind used for human oral consumption".  Nicorette chewing gum was zero-rated as the product requires authorisation from the Department of Health and Children, being classed as a medicinal product subject to the same controls which apply to medicines generally.Nicotine patches are, however, subject to the standard VAT rate of 21% and can not be zero-rated as they are not a medication used for human oral consumption.

Meath is currently under consideration and is subject to the identification of a suitable property solution and the availability of capital funds. In the interim, OPW may provide temporary additional accommodation at the existing station facility.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	735	The Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, as amended, provides for a Stamp Duty Exemption on the purchase of farm land by Young Trained Farmers.  To qualify for the relief, an individual must, on the date of execution of the instrument of transfer, be under 35 years of age and hold a relevant qualification.The relevant qualifications are set out in Schedules to the Act.  A degree in Agri-Environmental Science awarded by University College Dublin is not a specified qualification for the purposes of the relief.However, the legislation provides that the Revenue Commissioners will treat another qualification as a relevant qualification where Teagasc certifies that — a. the other qualification corresponds to a relevant qualification, and b. the other qualification is deemed by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland to be at least at a level equivalent to the specified relevant qualifications.Teagasc has examined the Agri-Environmental Sciences Degree and has taken the view that it does not have sufficient production agriculture and farm business management content in the core modules to meet the stamp duty relief and installation aid requirement as "young trained farmers".  However, it is recognised that some students may have chosen production agriculture and farm business management as their options/electives in the degree programme. Teagasc and UCD have agreed on a list of options/electives, when achieved as components of, or additions to the Agri-Environmental Sciences Degree that will enable Teagasc to issue letters of equivalence for stamp duty relief and installation aid.I would suggest that any individual with concerns about this Degree contacts UCD to determine, firstly, if the options/electives he has completed meet the above requirements and, secondly, what additional option/electives he must undertake in order to meet the qualification requirements for stamp duty relief and installation aid. Otherwise the general position is that an Agri-Environmental Sciences degree holder is treated as holding a non-agricultural award and may be required to complete the new FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture course programme with Teagasc in order to meet the qualification requirements.

As ‘legal highs' are not controlled substances, there is no basis at present to prevent their advertisement and sale.The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, my Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (magic) mushrooms were brought under control and their possession and sale are now an offence. Furthermore, following the European Council of Ministers' decision in March 2008 to bring Benzylpiperazine (BZP) under control, which was deemed to pose an excessive risk as a party pill, my Department will be introducing regulations to restrict the availability of BZP.

Once this part of the 2007 Act is commenced, he or she will inspect centres against the regulations governing these centres and standards set by HIQA.In January 2007, draft National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People were published.  The standards were developed by a working group chaired by Department of Health and Children and included the Health Service Executive, Social Service Inspectorate and the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board. Once introduced, these standards will apply to all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary.As the Health Act, 2007 provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), the draft standards were formally referred to HIQA for consultation and finalisation.  The Authority established a wide-ranging Working Group to finalise the draft standards. Earlier this year the Board of the Authority approved their draft National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People and submitted them for the approval of the Minister for Health and Children, as required under section 10(2) of the Health Act, 2007.The draft Standards and the Regulations required to underpin them are subject to a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) before finalisation.  The RIA process has commenced and it is intended to have the RIA finalised and both the approved Standards and Regulations in place in 2009.The overall resources that will be made available to HIQA in 2009 is dependent on the outcome of the budget and estimates process for next year, which is not yet finalised.   It is not appropriate for me or my Department to comment on the resources that will be allocated in 2009, prior to the announcement of the Budget 2009 package.

Entitlement to a medical card is determined mainly by reference to means, with provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of ‘undue hardship' where the income guidelines are exceeded.Medical card holders are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.  Determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Individuals with medical cards residing in nursing homes have the same eligibility to services as those in the community.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	743	As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which concluded at the end of 2007.The NCIP  has been allocated €575 million over 5 years, and is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places 10,000 of which will be for the 3 to 4 year old age group and 5,000 for school age children.  The Programme which is Exchequer funded aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality childcare supports and services which are grounded in an understanding of local needs.Preliminary figures collated by Pobal indicate that, approximately 10,500 new pre-school places will be created under the NCIP capital funding committed to date, thus exceeding the programme's target.  These places will be in addition to almost  40,000 new childcare places, of which a large number would be in the pre-school age cohort, that were delivered under the EOCP.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.The NCIP, the successor programme to the EOCP supports community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents.  Under this programme the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced with effect from 1st January 2008.  The CCSS has been allocated €154.2 million over the next 3 years, representing a substantial increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme (which cost €37 million in 2007), and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.

The overall budget for each Department/Agency is determined by Government following discussions between the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance as part of the estimates process.  The budget for children with special needs would form part of these discussions in each case.Section 5 of the Disability Act, 2005 deals with the provision of resources for services provided for people with a disability.  Subsection 2 provides that where a Minister proposes or arranges for the provision of such services, the Minister shall allocate out of the moneys available to him or her for the year such amount as he or she considers appropriate for the provision of those services.  Subsection 4 provides that, in determining the appropriate allocation, the Minister shall ensure that the amount remaining after the allocation is not less than the amount that is appropriate, having regard, inter alia, to the extent of the Minister's other obligations in that year.The Office for Disability & Mental Health supports the Minister of State for Equality, Disability & Mental Health in the exercise of his functions across four Government Departments — Health & Children; Education & Science; Justice, Equality & Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade & Employment.  Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health, but much remains to be done.  In particular, there is a need to improve co-ordination and communication across different Government Departments and agencies in their delivery of services.   This will be the main focus for the Office in the coming months.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	748	In the first instance I should like to reiterate that the development of robust, responsive and appropriate child welfare and protection services is a priority for both myself, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Government.  Recent statements, such as that made by the Ombudsman for Children, along with significant media coverage of this area has facilitated a valuable public debate around these important issues during which voice has been given to a number of legitimate concerns, particularly in the area of service provision.  I would, however also highlight the many instances of positive outcomes in relation to child welfare and protection issues.Following my appointment as Minister for Children I initiated and chair regular meetings with senior officials from the HSE so as to drive reform and modernisation of services for children and families.  The HSE has assured me that in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, the HSE responds immediately and takes appropriate action.  All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment, aimed at providing appropriate interventions.  In addition, there are legislative mechanisms in place which also allow for responses from Gardai (for example to take a child to safety in emergency situations relating to welfare and protection).In relation to the provision of out of hours care to vulnerable children and families I have now got agreement from the HSE to put in place an out of hours service to include existing GP, acute hospital and mental health out of hours services.  The HSE is currently finalising plans for this development.  It is anticipated that significant progress will be made in this regard over the coming weeks.  The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention.  I have come to the conclusion that given the nature of the cases likely to present as emergencies after hours that such an integrated approach is essential.  The planned development will also include the provision of a service whereby Gardaí can access appropriate care options as places of safety for children taken into care out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act.  In so doing, the HSE hopes to provide a standardised response across the country.  This approach promises a more integrated model of service provision which acknowledges the linkages between HSE services while endeavouring to utilise the overall resources already in place to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours.Recent years have seen a period of major investment in child care and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns with over €240 million of Government funds added to the annual investment in child care services since 1997.  The core principle underpinning all of these reforms and additional funding is to provide children and young people with the appropriate care and to provide services to protect them, as far as possible, from all forms of harm.  The HSE have informed me that, at the end of 2007, 90% of children in care do have an allocated social worker and that social work services are available to all children in HSE care.  Increases in resources for child care and family support services have continued in recent years.The focus for development in the coming years is on preventive, community-based services which provide early intervention within a Community/Primary Care context.  The development of alternative community care services will, over time, impact on the numbers of children in residential and foster care.  International and Irish research indicates that in many situations cases can best be dealt with by way of welfare and care services rather than protection services.The Agenda for Children's Services is the new overarching policy document of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for these areas and was launched in December 2007.  The Agenda, with its clear renewed emphasis on family support coupled with reflective questions to enable service provider self evaluation, represents the fundamental change now underway on how Government policy in relation to children is formulated and delivered.  It has been developed drawing on research and best practice at home and internationally.  It requires an outcomes focus and integrated service delivery in line with the recommendations of the OECD review of the Irish public service.  To help implement the policy and principles in the Agenda, at the instigation of my office, the HSE is well advanced in the process of specifying a child and family support services operational policy.  This is vital to effective reform and rebalancing of children's services.  The OMCYA is involved in the development of this policy working in partnership with the HSE.International experience of social work reform has shown how important communication and timely flows of commonly understood shared information are to success.  Within the HSE the Child Care Information Project is initially implementing standard assessment and referral methods leading on to standardisation of national child protection procedures.  This project, in tandem with other major initiatives such as the review of the Children First child protection guidelines and the publication by HSE of their Child Protection Framework, will work in synergy with the Knowledge Management Strategy under development for child welfare and protection.  This Strategy aims to ensure availability of better information, improved communication and application of research findings to service provision, management evaluation and policy analysis.  As the above initiatives illustrate, the HSE is working towards defined information and evidence-based practice.All of these initiatives are aimed at producing better integrated interagency service provision.  They also seek to provide for earlier intervention through more comprehensive interlocking service provision for children, based on clear planning and agreed outcomes in line with the move to family support initiatives as well as child protection services.I am confident that my Office and the HSE will bring about significantly improved and integrated child welfare and protection services for all children who need such services.  The programme I have described illustrates how much is being done to realise this objective.

Developing and improving an evidence base is clearly important and in the coming months the Office for Disability and Mental Health will be looking at how we can increase the range and level of information that is available across all relevant areas and how existing information can best be analysed, communicated to those who need it, and effectively applied to inform policies and decisions.

Responsibility for implementation of this legislation lies primarily with the Department of Education and Science.The EPSEN Act has not yet been commenced. However, I am not aware of any recommendation in the Act of the kind referred to by the Deputy. If the Deputy can furnish my office with more detail on what she has in mind, I will endeavour to establish the background.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The guiding principle of mainstreaming public services for people with disabilities was adopted by the government in 2000. The National Disability Strategy and the components contained therein, most notably the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, provide a legal basis for this principle.It is a commonly held view that early educational interventions should, where possible, take place within the existing Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) infrastructure. Within these settings, the staff have a critical role in mediating the learning environment and ensuring that there is an appropriate and effective environment for children with differing learning profiles. Consequently, I have no plans to introduce such a separate pilot scheme of the kind suggested.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The final out-turn on Vote expenditure for the Health Service Executive in 2007, shows there was an overall surrender of approximately €39m, after a total out-turn of €11,435,462m. The non capital programme shows a saving of €50m and a further saving of €18m for Appropriations-in-Aid. This was used to offset an overspend of €29m in capital spending.The actual levels of service provided in most areas were in excess of the planned targets for 2007 as set out in the approved National Service Plan.  This was particularly the case in the acute hospital sector and the community drugs schemes.  At the same time the rate of progress was less than planned in the development of the primary care teams and some developments in mental health services and there was a considerable underspend on the scheme for the repayment of charges for long stay accommodation under Section 13 of the Health (Repayment Scheme) 2006.This resulted in the need for a Supplementary Estimate which in effect did not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer as the increased costs from the higher levels of activity were met from savings in other areas and on the repayments scheme.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The objective of performance evaluation is to examine the evidence of quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness in the health system.  There is a wide range of hospital data on patient outcomes which enables this measurement. In addition to outcome measures such as mortality, indicators of process of care are also important.  For example, in relation to cancer procedures, it is known that the volume of cases is positively correlated with better patient outcomes.It must be understood that publishing data, in the form described in the Deputy's question, can be both misleading and open to misinterpretation. A considerable amount of international work has been carried out on the advisability of reporting on this data. Expert opinion is divided on its benefit and as a result practices vary widely between countries.  A valid and robust system of statistical adjustment must be in place in order to quantify the prior risk and severity of cases presenting for major surgery so as to allow for meaningful comparisons to be made.  At present, hospital discharge data as reported through the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry (HIPE) system, do not adequately adjust for risk.  This could lead to specialist centres which usually cater for more complex cases erroneously appearing to have higher mortality rates.  Furthermore, in the HIPE system, patients who die outside hospital or who are emergency transfers to another hospital and subsequently die may not be adequately counted. This would limit the  reliability of reported mortality rates even where standardisation procedures are applied.The performance indicators in use in support of the National Service Plan include many measures relating to patient outcomes, access, effectiveness and efficiency of health services. They, and other potential systems of monitoring, are subject to on-going development and refinement by my Department in collaboration with both the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). Such developments may include, if deemed appropriate, measures of post-operative mortality rates.  This work is also aligned with the work of international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to ensure that we are able to benchmark ourselves against best international standards.Other than through these mechanisms, my Department has no plans to publish data on hospital mortality rates for major surgical procedures.  The Deputy will be aware that there are a range of strategic initiatives in place to improve the quality of clinical services. They address the need to improve standards of care and will minimise variations in the outcomes patients may experience. These include: Cancer Control: A National Strategy; a Vision for Change; the Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland; Tackling Chronic Disease: A Policy Framework for the Management of Chronic Diseases; etc.

My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.In regard to hospital services generally in the HSE South region, the HSE is undertaking a strategic review of these services.  The review focuses on identifying the best configuration of acute hospital services in the South including arrangements for A&E, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population.This review will act as one of the inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the Southern region. The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to re-organisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders and that each element is progressed incrementally. I believe that it is important to work with health professionals and other interested parties to secure an increasing set of improvements over time. This approach will, I am confident, produce the best outcome for patients.  The final draft of the report is currently under consideration by the HSE.

This work is being progressed, on foot of a Government decision in February 2006, by an Inter Departmental Implementation Group, under the Chairmanship of the Department of Health and Children, with representation from the DSFA and the HSE. Detailed arrangements are already in place for example to transfer the Domiciliary Care Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance to the DSFA in 2009.It is expected that a review of the Mobility Allowance will take place following the successful transfer of the above mentioned allowances.

To date 18,300 claimants have received offers of repayment totalling over €342m and in excess of 13,700 payments have been made totalling over €285m. The HSE anticipates that the remaining claims will be processed by the end of November. However,  it should be noted that any offers made in November cannot be paid until the statutory 28 day period  allowed for appeals has elapsed and a completed acceptance form has been returned to the Scheme Administrator.  Any claim that is appealed will be finalised following a determination by the Appeals Office.The overall cost of the scheme is expected to be in the region of €390m. The total cost of administering the scheme to date is €19.5m which includes payments to the Scheme Administrator, HSE administrative costs, legal fees and probate costs and the administrative costs of the Appeals Office.The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006. Two Appeals Officers have been appointed to consider appeals. Up to 10 October 2008 the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office had received 4,241 completed appeal forms. The Appeals Officers have issued decisions in 2,266 of these cases. 407 of these decisions will result in an amended offer to the claimant.

For centuries they have been a side effect of medical treatment, especially in hospitals.  There are a number of types of HCAIs, MRSA and C. difficile are the most widely publicised.  The more medical care a person requires, the more likely they are to develop a health care associated infection.  These infections are more common among people with serious illnesses or at high risk such as patients with a weakened immune system, patients who have been treated for leukaemia or cancer, or who have had an organ transplant.Tackling HCAIs continues to be a challenge for all healthcare systems.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that there are 98 alleged health care associated infection claims and to date one case has been settled.

It is her intention to bring the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible with a view to implementing the scheme in 2009.Under the new scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will negotiate prices for long-term care with private nursing home owners on behalf of the State.  Where nursing homes agree prices for the purposes of the scheme with the NTPF, the NTPF will recommend the homes to the Health Service Executive for inclusion on the list of nursing homes ‘approved' for the scheme.  A person availing of the scheme can then choose any approved private nursing home or public nursing home on the list subject to availability and the suitability of the home to meet their care needs.The NTPF's negotiating role under the scheme will be an ongoing one.  The price agreed with private nursing homes for the purposes of the scheme will naturally be subject to periodic re-negotiation to take account of inflation and other developments.  The NTPF will commence its role under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme as soon as the legislation has been passed and the relevant section of the Act commenced.

It is building on the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006 (EOCP) and incorporates among its key objectives: increasing the supply and improving the quality of early childhood care and education services.  Services eligible for support include those providing care for babies, full-day care, part-time, sessional playschool, Montessori and other pre-school places, school age childcare including "wrap around" childcare places, and childminding.  Special consideration is given to supporting services which provide a range of these services.Applicants for capital funding under the NCIP first apply through their local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC), whose role it is to identify gaps in childcare provision in their respective areas and to assist applicants to develop proposals to fill identified local needs.  The initial assessment of grant applications is undertaken by the local CCC and is then referred to Pobal, which manages the day to day operation of the programme on behalf of my Office.  Following Pobal's assessment of the applications they are forwarded to the Childcare Directorate of my Office for recommendation on funding.With regard to the childcare facility referred to by the Deputy, my Office has enquired from Wexford CCC and Pobal and there is no record of any application pending for a capital grant on their behalf.

Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, my Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.  For example, in 2006 psychotropic (magic) mushrooms were brought under control and their possession and sale is now an offence.  Furthermore, following the European Council of Ministers' decision in March 2008 to bring Benzylpiperazine (BZP) under control, which was deemed to pose an excessive risk as a party pill, my Department will be introducing regulations to restrict the availability of BZP.

While the legislation was sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, together with the Health Service Executive, are charged with specific statutory duties, most notably concerning the implementation of Part 2 of the Act.As the Deputy is aware, intervention early in life can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment.  In recognition of this, Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June 2007.  This entitles parents of young children with disabilities to an independent assessment of their children's health and education needs and a statement of the services which it is proposed to provide for them.  To date over 2,800 applications for an assessment of need have been received and are being processed by the HSE.It is proposed that Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be further commenced for children aged 5 to 18 in tandem with the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  In preparation for its implementation, health related support services for children aged 5 to 18 continue to be enhanced and strengthened to enable the Health Service Executive to meet needs identified for this group.Proposals for implementation are continually under scrutiny and take place in the context of the Annual Estimates process.

The Act did not however address the issue of informed consent to treatment generally.For the purposes of Mental Health Act 2001, consent means consent, obtained freely without threats or inducements, wherethe consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient certifies that the patient is capable of understanding the nature, purpose and likely effects of the proposed treatment, andthe psychiatrist has given the patient adequate information, in a form and a language that the patient can understand on the nature, purpose and likely effects of the proposed treatment.Under the Act the consent of a patient to treatment is required except where the consultant psychiatrist considers that the treatment is necessary to safeguard the life of the patient, to restore his or her health, to alleviate his or her condition, or to relieve his or her suffering, and the patient is incapable of giving such consent because of his/her mental disorder.  It is accepted that the provisions relating to consent to treatment will require further consideration in the context of the new capacity legislation currently being prepared by the Dept of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

Under this campaign there is a commitment to reducing energy use and carbon emissions by 15% per annum.In conjunction with the campaign and with the assistance of relevant Consultants an energy audit was carried out in my Department's headquarters in Hawkins House.  The audit recommended various ways of achieving energy efficiencies and these were presented to all staff at a number of awareness sessions.  The recommendations are now being implemented throughout my Department and an Energy Officer has been appointed to monitor progress on a monthly basis.In 2007 all the old lighting in Hawkins House was replaced with a new energy efficient lighting system.  This included the installation of lights in all kitchenettes which switch off automatically when not in use.  In 2007 also an environmental sub-committee of the Department's Partnership Group was established.  The role of this committee is to examine all avenues of energy saving, as well as other environmental issues, and to bring these to the attention of all staff.  This committee will assist in driving efficiency measures across the Department.Measures being taken by agencies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the agencies themselves.  My Department is asking the agencies concerned to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	793	In January 2007, as part of the Government's commitment to ensuring patient safety and quality in our health services, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.  The Commission's Report — ‘Building a Culture of Patient Safety' was published in August 2008.  This is the first report of its kind and it makes far reaching recommendations which when implemented will impact very positively on patients and their families.The most significant recommendation of the report is the introduction of a licensing system for all health services whether they are delivered publicly or privately and such a system would of course require legislation which will be extremely complex and take some time to develop.  Other recommendations in the report which would require legislation include a mandatory system of adverse event reporting and legal protection for information collected through such a system.  Similar protection is also suggested for information provided in the context of a process of open disclosure or clinical or other patient safety audit.The implementation plan endorsed by the Commission recommends the immediate establishment of an Implementation Steering Group (ISG) with clear and regular reporting obligations to the Minister for Health and Children regarding progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Report.  This also requires the establishment of expert sub-groups composed of representatives of relevant stakeholders, each of which will be required to report to the ISG on the practical and detailed implementation of the recommendations within their remit.  The advantages of this model are that it immediately builds on the structures already in place and can deliver results quickly.I am currently considering the Commission's recommendations in detail. It is my intention to bring the report, together with an implementation strategy, which will include proposals relating to both of the issues raised by the Deputy, to Government for approval as soon as possible.

The IMB is obliged to ensure that tissue and cell procurement is carried out by persons with appropriate training and experience and that it takes place in conditions which meet quality and safety standards and are authorised for that purpose.Under the Regulations, it is permissible for a maternity hospital, or other institution, to apply for an authorisation to procure umbilical cord blood on its premises.  It is also permissible for an organisation, company or person to apply for an authorisation to procure umbilical cord blood at premises other than their own.  In this latter instance, the applicant is required to have a written contract or service level agreement in place with any hospital, clinic or person carrying out the actual act of procurement.The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS), which has responsibility for the indemnification and management of all clinical negligence claims in the Health Service Executive, public hospitals and certain scheduled agencies issued a notice on 29th September 2008 on collection of umbilical cord blood.  The notice clarifies that collection of cord blood for personal banking by a commercial organisation does not come within the definition of "professional medical services" as defined in the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Functions) Order 2003 (No. 63 of 2003).  A doctor, midwife or nurse who procures blood on behalf of a third party is not covered by the CIS for such procurement.The HSE has made provision for directed donation of umbilical cord stem cells for high risk cases.  In such cases, collection on foot of a request by a consultant haematologist in respect of the treatment of a named individual is organised by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, which is authorised by the IMB for this purpose and is covered by the CIS.In relation to research, I am aware that a range of research projects are underway which are examining the potential benefits of stem cell treatment.  My Department will keep this issue under review.

The Capital Plan includes provision for the development of the new hospital and the associated Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght.The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established in May, 2007.  Its primary function is to plan, design, furnish and equip the new national paediatric hospital.  The Health Service Executive is working closely with the Board in progressing the project.The project is currently at initiation stage.  A contract has been awarded for business advisory services.  A detailed Development Brief for the new hospital is being prepared and is due for completion by the end of the 1st Quarter 2009.  The Development Brief will be converted into a detailed design, outlining the exact dimensions and specifications for the new hospital, to allow the project proceed to tender for construction.  A more accurate estimate of costs will be available at that point.My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to revert directly to the Deputy on the other issues raised by him.

Nicotine replacement therapies would not normally satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public.  Notwithstanding this, nicotine replacement therapies are available to medical card holders since April 2001 on foot of recommendations made by the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group and the Advisory Forum established to support the Task Force in the implementation of the strategy.  Evidence shows that lower socio-economic groups have a higher incidence of smoking and spend a higher proportion of disposable income on tobacco.  It was considered that this group is in greatest need of assistance in helping them to quit the habit.  Accordingly, it was decided, as an exceptional measure, to make nicotine replacement therapies available on prescription to medical card holders. There are no plans to extend this to the Drug Payment Scheme.

These issues were widely reported in 2007. In June 2008 the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) awarded the contract for cytology laboratory testing for the national cervical screening programme to Quest Diagnostics. Quest Diagnostics successfully met all the required criteria set out under the procurement process which was open to local and international laboratories. Quest Diagnostics was previously contracted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to clear significant backlogs of smear tests in the Irish system.The NCSS has informed my Department that Quest Diagnostics has not been convicted of fraud or an offence.  Quest Diagnostics was involved in Federal Settlements in the United States and had previously made a full disclosure of these issues to the HSE and more recently to the NCSS during the course of its procurement process. The US Federal Authorities have not barred Quest from ongoing participation in Federal or State level reimbursement schemes.The national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck, commenced on 1 September. This service is free to all women in Ireland aged between 25 and 60 years of age.  Screening will be provided every three years for women aged between 25 and 44 and every five years for women aged between 45 and 60 years of age in line with best international practice.  Results will be provided to women within four weeks of having their smear test taken. The NCSS is confident that Quest Diagnostics will provide a service which offers consistency on quality, turnaround of results and on capacity.

Such submissions are considered as part of the discussions on the Estimates and Budget each year.  While it is not appropriate to comment further on the organisations (details supplied) pre-budget submissions, I would like to point out that this year's Budget is being framed against the background of challenging economic circumstances.In relation to health services for people with a disability, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the significant resources which have been expended on disability services in 2008.  The Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability Services makes provision for the development of additional residential, respite places and day care places for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism and additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.In the 2008 Budget, €50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability.  Although the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review, I am pleased to inform you that the Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is now in the process of rolling out the planned developments.  The HSE has indicated that due to the delayed start to some of these developments it expects to spend €33m of the €50m by the end of 2008.  The resulting €17m time related savings were included in this Department's budgetary consolidation measures announced to the House in July 2008.It is not appropriate for me or my Department to comment on the resources that will be allocated in 2009, prior to the announcement of the Budget 2009 package.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	807	I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006 — 2010 (NCIP) under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced in January of this year.The CCSS is open to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees to parents who qualify under the scheme as disadvantaged or on low income.  Participating services are required to apply for funding in September in respect of the following calendar year. As part of its application, the service is required to forward declaration forms completed by parents of children attending the service, who hope to qualify for reduced childcare fees.  The service is also required to provide a summary of service-related details. To facilitate services in making applications for grant funding, an electronic system for returns was introduced in September of this year.  While this has been generally welcomed by childcare services in the CCSS, if a service demonstrates that it has a particular difficulty in using the electronic system a hard copy application will be accepted by my Office.The amount of funding a service qualifies for is assessed on the basis of the information provided by it each September.  The service is expected to use the grant funding to implement a tiered fee system with all qualifying parents benefiting from the appropriate subvention rates.  A service would not normally be expected to have any difficulty in this regard, however, if a significant change in the parent profile arises during the course of the year, it can apply for a review of its funding level.I wish to advise the Deputy that, in advance of the introduction of the new electronic return system, three regional briefing sessions were organised by the Childcare Directorate of my Office for the staff of the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCC), to enable them to assist and advise CCSS applicants with any queries regarding accessing or using the electronic return facility.  I understand that the CCCs are also facilitating applicants who do not have access to computer or broadband facilities by allowing them to use facilities within their offices.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that to date almost 80% of services applying for funding under the CCSS for 2009 have made their electronic return and my Office is continuing to receive returns.

Since 2007 the scheme has been mainstreamed as the Rural Transport Programme and thirty seven community transport groups around the country are being funded under the RTP to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs. While the provision of transport services for older people and people with disabilities is a core feature of the RTP, services operated under the Programme are open to the general public.The bottom-up approach developed during the pilot Rural Transport Initiative (2002-2006) demonstrated that local people know best what transport services they need. My role, therefore, continues to be one of helping local communities to address their transport needs through financial and administrative support, while communities themselves take the lead in clarifying their needs and developing co-ordinated transport services to fulfil those needs.With regard to the natural boundaries for RTP services, over the years, a variety of service models and operational areas have developed from parish-based approaches to operations across two or more counties. Pobal, which administers the RTP on behalf of my Department, has commenced a process to extend the Programme on a phased basis with a goal of achieving nation-wide coverage in due course in line with Government policy. As part of that process, Pobal has indicated that it is having due regard to current Government policy regarding local development structures and cohesion which aims to integrate local delivery structures at County Level.I understand that RTP funded car schemes are operational in Counties Sligo and Leitrim and that such schemes are being contemplated elsewhere.

The options being considered are Malin, Shannon and Valentia.

Since this is in line with our EU obligations, there is no power to restore this scheme.

Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three State airports.I have already received the Cork and Shannon business plans and I expect shortly to receive a finalised commentary on those plans by the DAA when they submit their own plan under the Act.   I would expect DAA's commentary to address recent trends in the aviation market, the challenges facing the State airports and the financial and operational aspects of restructuring.

The implementation of individual national road projects, including service areas, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.In addition, Section 54 of the Roads Act 1993 specifically provides for the NRA or a local authority to provide or operate service areas.

The introduction of tax concession for parking at stations is not under consideration in the current budgetary environment. The position in relation to reform of bus licensing is that it is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will be contained in a Public Transport Regulation Bill which will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  At this stage it is too early to be precise on the detail of the proposals except to confirm that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann, and will encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area in a manner consistent with EU Regulation 1370/2007 on public service obligations.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children has been examining the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2007, published in February 2007 by the Minister for Health and Children.  That Bill provided wording for inclusion in the Constitution on the rights of children which would be put to the people in a referendum.  The wording included a provision that would allow the Oireachtas to pass laws providing for offences of absolute or strict liability committed against children under 18 years of age.  The Committee is due to report to the Oireachtas by the end of November.I am awaiting the Report of that Committee.  However, consultations have taken place with the Attorney General on the options for legislation that may be available.  Whatever recommendations may emerge from the Joint Committee's Report, I am determined to ensure, be it through a constitutional amendment, further legislation or a combination of both, that greater protection against sexual abuse and exploitation will be provided for children and other vulnerable people in our society.

The Coroner inquiry process is a matter for the relevant Coroner, who is independent in the exercise of that quasi-judicial role.In certain cases a post-mortem will be required so that the Coroner can carry out his/her statutory functions and a range of factors can influence the time it takes for the post-mortem report to be forwarded by the pathologist concerned.  I am advised by the Cork Coroner's Office that in their experience, it generally takes between three and six months for a post-mortem report to be received, but that in cases where further specialist tests, e.g. toxicology, histology and microbiology, are required, it may take longer.

In light of the limited time available for reply and the wide range of organisations in question, it would not be feasible to compile the equivalent figures over a 10 year period without the application of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  More detailed information is generally available in the Book of Estimates and in annual and other reports from the organisations in question.It is important to stress that not all the staff positions referred to herein are new.

The prescribed manner is as set out in S.I No. 216/1956.  It must include the name of the person naturalised, their address, the date of the certificate and whether the person was of full age or a minor.  The on-line availability of Iris Oifigiúil is not a matter which falls within the remit of my Department.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 19 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time. In addition, the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 10 August 2007, of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that the person concerned was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 30 September 2008.The case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will now be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned is passed to me for decision.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 May 2006, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her child.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her child should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	835	The persons concerned, a husband and wife, arrived in the State on 9 January 2002 and 5 March 2002 respectively. He claimed asylum on 9 January 2002 and she claimed asylum on 6 March 2002. Their applications were refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The persons concerned were informed by separate letters dated 10 June 2003, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them and afforded them three options under Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended); namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit written representations, within 15 working days, setting out reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.Their case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations received on their behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 26 August 2004 and 3 August 2004 respectively, the then Minister refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of them.Notice of the husband's order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 13 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. Notice of the wife's order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself at the GNIB on Thursday 20 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State. They both presented as required and were given further presentation dates by GNIB.On 28 February 2005, legal proceedings were instituted in the High Court on behalf of the persons concerned challenging the decision of the then Minister to deport them. Said application was refused on 29 November 2006. Subsequently, the persons concerned were advised by registered letter dated 9 January 2007 that their legal proceedings had been determined and that the then Minister intended to proceed with their removal from the State. They were required to present themselves at GNIB on Monday 15 January 2007 in order to make travel arrangements for their removal from the State. They presented as required and were given further presentation dates which they kept. The husband is due to present himself again at Anglesea Street Garda Station, County Cork on Monday 20 October 2008 while the wife is due to present herself again at GNIB on the same date.The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  I am satisfied that the applications made by the persons concerned for asylum and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined.  The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	836	The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  The first person referred to in the details supplied applied for asylum on 19 April 2006.  She was initially accommodated at Watergate House and was subsequently accommodated at the Ursuline accommodation centre, Waterford.  This person gave birth to a child on 11 October 2006.The second person referred to in the details supplied applied for asylum on 6 June 2006. He was initially accommodated at Kilmacud House reception centre and has been accommodated at Kinsale Road accommodation centre since 19 June 2006.  The RIA understands that the persons referred to were married in December, 2007. The first contact from either party requesting that they be accommodated together was received on 3 January 2008. Both parties refused to be accommodated anywhere other than at Kinsale Road accommodation centre. Kinsale Road accommodation centre has high occupancy levels and no accommodation suitable for this family has become available at the centre in this time.The RIA has offered alternative accommodation in its portfolio to this family on a number of occasions but these offers have been refused every time. If the family still wish to be accommodated together, they should apply again to the RIA but should understand that the situation in respect of their demand to be accommodated at Kinsale Road remains unchanged.

The position remains as stated.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	838	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in January 2008.  Officials in that section are currently processing applications received in June 2006. Applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The current processing time for applications for certificates of naturalisation is approximately 28 months.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	839	The existing processing time for certificates of naturalisation is currently twenty eight months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in recent years.  The Citizenship Section of my Department has recently decentralised to Tipperary Town and additional staff resources have also been allocated there. This is already helping to reduce the backlog of applications on hand and reduce waiting times. The procedures employed to assess an applicant  for naturalisation are summarised below.Upon receipt, an initial examination of each application is carried out to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.Further processing takes place at a later stage and involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Inquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time inquiries are also made with the Garda Síochana to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  Depending on the complexity of any given case, these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.  Once all inquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.The Deputy will appreciate that the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  These procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.

I wish to refer the Deputy to my Reply to Parliamentary Question NO. 373 dated 30th September 2008.  If the Garda Commissioner receives an application for a project in Cork city, it will be assessed and a decision will be made in the light of available resources.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	841	I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 384 of Wednesday, 4 June 2008 and 476 of Tuesday, 11 March 2008, and the written Replies to those Questions.The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 16 November 2004.  Her two children were included in her application.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  The person concerned then lodged Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court challenging the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that she not be declared to be a refugee.  These Proceedings were successful.  The person concerned was afforded a fresh consideration of her asylum claim by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  This further consideration took place but again the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.  The person concerned appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal who affirmed the earlier recommendation.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 13 February 2008, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she and her children should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed the case file of the person concerned is be passed to me for decision.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	843	I can advise the Deputy that my Department is participating in the inter-Departmental process, co-ordinated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with a view to reducing by 25% the administrative burden placed on businesses by Government.I envisage that the identification, prioritisation and measurement process should be completed by all Departments by the end of 2009. While it is too early in the process to provide the Deputy with the detailed information requested it is not expected that my Department will be identified as one of those Departments that imposes the greatest administrative burden on businesses.  On completion of the measurement exercise, simplification plans will be prepared detailing how the 25% target will be met by the end of 2012.

When I have received the full report I will consider the question of any further action which may be necessary on my part.  I should mention also that I understand that there have been contacts between An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission about the case and I have agreed to a request from the Commissioner that the interim report furnished to my Department should be made available to the Commission.

This is a long standing principle of our system of justice.  The role of the Gardaí is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP.  The Director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.People are convicted in court on the basis of the evidence presented in court.  Decisions on the admissibility of evidence are made by the court, and the jury or the court, as the case may be, decides on the guilt or innocence of the person charged.

An Awareness Raising Campaign will commence in Ireland later this month.The position in relation to funding remains the same as outlined on 3 July, 2008 — funding for combating human trafficking activities is part of the general expenditure from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Garda Votes and does not require specific earmarked expenditure.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I can advise the Deputy that my Department, in association with the Probation Service commissioned a ‘Review of Adult Probation Residential Facilities' in 2007 in order to examine and make recommendations on, inter alia, the management structure and overall governance and operation of the four residential facilities and the role of the Probation Service.  In addition, the review included an examination of the efficiency, effectiveness and value for money achieved from the funding provided.  The report was completed at the end of July 2008.The Report on the residential facilities provides the Probation Service and my Department with a very valuable ‘blueprint' of how the four facilities are currently operating.  I have to frankly state that the findings in respect of the facility cited by the Deputy gave cause for concern.  The overall conclusion of the Report was that the centre is in crisis.  There are serious indications (e.g. HR, financial and quality of service) that the organisation has become dysfunctional — the results of this review indicate that the organisation as it currently stands is no longer viable.  There were concerns expressed over the quality of care and rehabilitation.While the Probation Service provides funds for the centre, the centre itself is a limited company controlled by its own Board of Management.The Board, having responded by letter, copy of which was forwarded separately to the Deputy, indicated that they have been frustrated in attempting to resolve a growing range of serious difficulties relating to the operation and management of the centre, including limited programme participation levels.  They shared the concerns raised in the Report and they took the unanimous view that the preferred course of action was to close down the facility, take time to reflect on the learning and develop a vision and plan for a new way forward.The Board of Management therefore decided to close the centre and wind up the limited company.  I share the concerns contained in the Report and expressed by the Board.  In any event, I have no power to overturn the decision of the Board of Management.  The Probation Service will now work with the project to effect the orderly closure of the project in its present form.I am committed to finding the best option available to us to meet the addiction needs of the client group of the Probation Service.  The current report, combined with other reports on this facility, give us a good basis upon which to make informed decisions that will ultimately lead to a better, more focused and tailored service to this particular client group.  My Department and the Probation Service are committed to working to achieve a viable alternative that will bring added value to the work of the Service and most importantly, better meet the range of needs of individual clients with addiction and other issues.The Probation Service will now set about developing a detailed new vision for the centre in question, including identifying the needs for addiction treatment places in this catchments area, seeking to develop sustainable partnership to deliver the identified services.  I want to reiterate that this is not simply a money exercise.  It is a strategic review of services to a specific client group with particular needs so that we can provide the most appropriate service to that grouping.We must at all times, be mindful of the type and range of services we provide to key groupings, such as those with addiction issues; we must be willing to look critically at how we are providing those services and be prepared to examine, evaluate and if necessary start afresh in the knowledge that the service will be better able to meet the many and varied demands which are part and parcel of our population.

I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person in question was the subject of a Family Reunification/Permission to Remain application made by his brother in 2003.  The Family Reunification/Permission to Remain application was refused in August 2004 and the brother of the person in question was notified of the decision.

For security reasons, it is not Garda policy to release details of specific operations.  However all members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing the criminal law, including the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977/84 and the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  In this regard operational assistance from the Divisional Drug unit and national units such as GNDU, CAB, NBCI and GBFI will be provided to the District drug unit as and when appropriate.

Any breaches of the criminal law reported or uncovered by members of An Garda Síochána are fully investigated and, where sufficient evidence is adduced, charges are preferred, as directed by the Law Officers.An Garda Síochána is aware of the location of such outlets referred to as ‘Headshops', which purport to retail substances, advertised as giving a ‘legal high'.  A number of investigations in respect of products sold at these outlets have been completed and files submitted to the Law Officers for direction.  An Garda Síochána will continue to monitor the activities of such outlets and investigate any breaches of the criminal law.

The programme is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Funding for capital works is a matter for the Office of Public Works and priorities, including Easkey, will be considered in the light of available resources and in the context of the Garda Accommodation Strategy which is currently being developed.  In the interim, alternative accommodation arrangements have been made for the station party.

In fact, Roma are a minority ethnic group in Romania and elsewhere.  Many, but not all, of the Roma in Ireland came from Romania.There are no official statistics on the number of Roma here.  Different figures have been mentioned, for example 3,000, which would be about 0.07% of the population. This is the figure cited by the Roma Support Group.I agree on the importance of integrating Roma and all legally resident immigrants and I have set out my approach to this in my statement, Migration Nation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The Criminal Justice Act 2006 enacted provisions to combat anti-social behaviour by adults and children. Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007, and Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that from 1 January, 2007 to 31 August, 2008, 820 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and from 1 March, 2007 to 31 August, 2008, 477 behaviour warnings were issued to children. There have been ten formal good behaviour contracts agreed with children in the period 1 March, 2007 — 31 August, 2008.In addition to the criminal law, a wide range of initiatives is in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour. The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. Under the provisions of the Children Act, 2001 the Programme has a statutory basis.Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour. There are currently 100 projects operating throughout the country.More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system, and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended. The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts.The Adult Cautioning Scheme is an initiative of the Garda authorities developed in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Scheme makes provision for the administering of a caution by a senior Garda officer for certain minor offences, as an alternative to prosecution in the District Court, where prosecution is not required by the public interest and it is determined that a caution would be an effective response. The schedule of offences to which the scheme applies covers certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1984, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Damage Act 1991.Joint Policing Committees are provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005. On 24 September, I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, roll-out of the Committees to all 114 local authorities. As a result, a Committee will be established in each local authority in the country where a Committee had not already been established under an initial pilot phase. I believe that, over time, the Committees will make an enormous contribution to keeping our communities safe. They represent a partnership between the people, through their representatives, and An Garda Síochána in preventing and tackling crime and anti-social behaviour.Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order. In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Gardaí to tackle misuse of alcohol which is often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour.I recently signed Regulations enabling further public order provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 to come into operation. The Act places a restriction on the availability and visibility of alcohol and provides for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse. These provisions also allow for the issue of fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place, which are offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

No. 216/1956. It must include the name of the person naturalised, their address, the date of the certificate and whether the person was of full age or a minor.  The on-line availability of Iris Oifigiúil is not a matter which falls within the remit of my Department.

Because they generally require less processing than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly. Based on current processing trends, it is expected that the applications on behalf of the persons concerned will be processed in February 2009.

Because they generally require less processing than standard adult applications, it is usually possible to finalise them more quickly.All applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of minors are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.I am satisfied that the current arrangements for assessing applications on behalf of minors are appropriate and that decisions are being provided within a reasonable timeframe.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 16 May 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered before the file is passed to me for decision.The Deputy might wish to note that as the person concerned has not established a right of legal residency in the State, he is not entitled to be issued with a Garda National Immigration Bureau card.

The person referred to withdrew her application on 3 March 2006 and made a new application in respect of her mother and brother.The new application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  This investigation was completed and the Commissioner forwarded a report to my Department on 20 June 2006.Following the receipt of the report my Department issued a decision on 27 July 2006 refusing the application because the subjects of the application did not qualify as dependents under Section 18(4)(b) of the Refugee Act 1996.Since the decision was issued further correspondence was received from the person in question and my Department replied to that correspondence on 5 August 2008.

There are currently no Directives awaiting transposition in my Department.My colleague, Mr. Dick Roche T.D., Minister of State for European Affairs, chairs an Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on European Affairs, which keeps the transposition of EU measures under constant review.In this regard, the EU Internal Market Scoreboard shows the record of each Member State in transposing Single Market measures into national law. In July of this year, Ireland achieved its best ever performance on the Scoreboard, reaching a target set by the European Heads of State and Government to further reduce the transposition deficit to 1% by 2009.

The low level of bilateral trade indicated obvious potential for growth, and in this context I mentioned the importance we attached to unblocking Irish beef exports to Iran. In this regard, Ireland fully supports the approach of the EU3+3 which holds out the promise of expanded trade and other relations with Iran if the nuclear matter is resolved.I did not, and I clearly never would, use the language or share the sentiments attributed to me in the reports to which the Deputy refers. On the contrary, I strongly urged Iran to use its influence in the region to support efforts to reach a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and I specifically expressed deep concern at the wholly unacceptable threats made by the Iranian President regarding Israel. I also conveyed our serious concerns on human rights issues in Iran, including the position of the Baha'i community.

On occasion, Irish Aid provides financial support for such operations, including the element of transport costs. However, in respect of such operations, the procurement of air or other transport means by our partners is carried out in accordance with their own respective procurement rules.The UN World Food Programme (WFP), for example, which is the UN leader for logistics, contracts transport means in accordance with strict UN procurement rules, involving a competitive bid process. Under the Government's Rapid Response Initiative, Ireland has pre-positioned essential humanitarian supplies, non food items like blankets, tents, water tanks, kitchen sets and mosquito nets with the WFP. Under a 2006 Letter of Understanding between Irish Aid and the WFP, that organisation is tasked with the set up, procurement, management and transportation to the field — all under UN rules — of those supplies.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) is leading the cross-Government process to achieve this target.DETE has developed a methodology to identify, prioritise and measure administrative burdens, as a necessary prelude to burden reduction.  This methodology involves identifying all information obligations (IOs) arising from legislation that impose an administrative burden on business and prioritising these IOs for measurement by the end of 2008. To date, this Department has identified the legislation falling within its remit that imposes an administrative burden, and work is currently advancing on preparing a list of, and prioritising, all relevant IOs.  This work is progressing well, and the process of prioritising the most burdensome of the identified IOs for measurement remains on target for completion by the end of 2008.I understand that, according to the established methodology, burden measurement is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009.  On completion of the measurement exercise, simplification plans will be prepared detailing how the 25% target will be met by the end of 2012.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	878	Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The Programme has been run on an annual basis over the past number of years.  It is open to any organisation with a suitable project, which satisfies the terms and conditions of the programme, to apply for funding. Applications for the construction of swimming pools are not eligible under the programme, as the Department administers a separate local authority swimming pools programme.While the terms and conditions that apply to each round of the programme may vary from year to year a copy of the most recent guidelines, terms and conditions and application form are available on my Department's website.Applications for funding under the 2008 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on 13th and 14th of January and the deadline for receipt of applications was 29th February for paper-based applications and 7th March for online applications.  Allocations to 685 projects were announced at the end of July 2008.  There are no applications currently on hand.  The date of the next round of the Programme has not yet been decided.Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department and which has been closed to new applicants since July 2000, grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided to Local Authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.There are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  The Department and its technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department of Arts, Sport & Tourism.Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal was viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project was available and that the project, when completed, would have a satisfactory level of public access.  The Local Authority is responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the facility.Under the current round of the programme, the question of the location of public swimming pools is essentially a matter for local authorities.  Projects are considered on a case-by-case basis and consideration is given to such issues as to whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Department's annual estimates provision for the Programme.Since 2000, the total spent under the programme (to end September 2008) is €123.9m.  A total of €20m has been provided in 2008.Since 2000, some 57 applications have or are being dealt with.  45 projects have been approved grant-aid — of which 37 of these have been completed and 8 are under construction or due to start construction shortly.  In addition, 12 other applications are at various stages in the process:  2 are preparing tender documents; 7 are preparing contract documents and 3 are preparing preliminary reports.  Our priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in bringing into public use the remaining 20 pools, which are included in the current programme.  A status report on the current status of the 57 projects in the current round is being circulated in the official report.Status of individual swimming pool projects under the current round (closed 31 July, 2000) of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme:PROJECTS COMPLETED (37)Arklow (Refurbish) — official opening January 2000Courtown/Gorey (New) — opened October 2001Dundalk (New) — official opening March 2002Ennis (New) — official opening September 2003Enniscorthy (New) — official opening January 2000Monaghan (Refurbish) — re-entered programme for replacementNavan (New) — official opening August 2000Wicklow (New) — (Sept 99) official opening June 2001Roscommon (Refurbish) — official opening April 2002AquaDome, Tralee (Refurbish) — opened 2003Ballinasloe (Replace) — official opening October 2003Finglas, Dublin (Replace) — opened April 04Grove Island, Limerick (New) — opened June 04Sports and Leisure Centre, Tralee (Refurbish) — opened July 04Clonmel (Refurbish) — opened December 04Churchfield, Cork City (Refurbish) — official opening June 05Ballymun, Dublin City (Replace) — opened June 05Tuam, Co.

These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Two proposals have been submitted to my Department by Cork County Council on behalf of Dunmanway.  The first proposal was for a refurbishment of the existing pool together with an extension to accommodate additional facilities including a gym.  A Preliminary Report on this proposal was approved in March 2001.  The second proposal was for demolition of the existing facility and a rebuild to incorporate the pool, gym and ancillary facilities and this was received in December 2001.The OPW advised that the second proposal made a convincing case for a replacement pool.  However, as Cork County Council envisaged a private company operating and managing the pool the OPW instructed that the operators of the facility should be sourced and included prior to contract preparation so that their requirements might be incorporated in the design.  Cork County Council tendered for operators on two occasions but received only one submission.On re-examining the matter this year Cork County Council are considering reverting to the original proposal of a refurbishment/extension with the intention of operating the pool using their own employees and possibly operating or outsourcing the management of the gym.Cork County Council have therefore instructed JODA Engineering Consultants (who are the consultants appointed for this project) to update the costs of both proposals with the intention of making a final decision within the next month or so on which proposal to pursue. The Council will notify the Department once a final decision has been made.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	890	Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be "exceptional". Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice. Thus, an exceptional needs payment should be a single payment to meet an unforeseen and/or special need which cannot be met from a client's basic income.Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need.Urgent Needs Payments are similar to exceptional needs payments but are made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA for example in the case of damage caused by flooding or fire.The breakdown of expenditure on ENP's of €69m for 2007 is shown in the following tabular statement.Expenditure on Exceptional Needs Payments 2007Type of PaymentExpenditureTotal Expenditure€000€000

This payment was based on an assessment of weekly means of €194.00, derived from the capital value of a dwelling. He appealed this means assessment and following a review, a Deciding Officer assessed his means at nil from 1 May 2008. This decision is based on an Inspector's report to the effect that he was no longer deriving benefit from the property from that date, and is currently in the process of selling it. This decision entitles him to jobseeker's allowance at the weekly rate of €401.10. Arrears due will be issued to him shortly.Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments.  This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind.The South Eastern area of the Health Service Executive has advised that an exceptional needs payment of €800 has been made to the people concerned to assist them in the immediate aftermath of the flooding.  Rent supplement in respect of rented accommodation will be paid with effect from next week.  If the people concerned have any further needs, they should discuss this with their local community welfare officer.

The obligations cover, for example, cooperation with Social Welfare Inspectors in relation to PRSI inspections, notifying the Department of the commencement of employment and furnishing the Department with information relating to employees as part of the claim determination process.  I have arranged to send the lists directly to the Deputy.Prioritisation of these information obligations is currently under way and is expected to be completed by the end of 2008.  The prioritised information obligations will then be measured.  When measurement has been completed, simplification plans will be prepared detailing what a reduction in the administrative burden on business could be achieved.The Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is coordinating the overall process to measure and reduce administrative burdens on business across Government.  I understand that the Department envisages that the identification, prioritisation and measurement process should be completed by all Departments by the end of 2009.On completion of the measurement exercise simplification plans will be prepared detailing how the overall 25% relevant target would be met by the end of 2012.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.The main data on poverty levels in Ireland are derived from the annual EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). Results for the fourth year of the survey, 2006, were published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in November 2007. The survey results do not break down poverty rates by county, as the survey sample size is too small. In 2006 the achieved sample size was 5,836 households and 14,634 individuals. The survey does, however, provide a Regional breakdown, by Border, Midlands and West region and by Southern and Eastern region, as defined in the NUTS2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units) classification used by Eurostat. The results, broken down by gender, are provided in the following Table 1.When EU-SILC results for 2007 are available the CSO will be examining the possibility of providing a further breakdown of the data by each of the eight Regional Authorities established under Local Government legislation. This breakdown would correspond to the Eurostat NUTS 3 classification.  A report "Mapping Poverty: National, Regional and County Patterns", published in 2005 by the Combat Poverty Agency, provides some data by local authority area. The report states that sampling factors limit the extent to which the data can be reliably broken down by county and concludes that, while it might be possible to do this, "it would not be sensible to do so because of the wide margin of error associated with the figures".  The breakdown of poverty data by local authority area is provided in Table 2. This data is not fully comparable with the data provided under the EU-SILC survey because of survey differences relating to such issues as how income and consistent poverty are measured.An analysis of the Combat Poverty Agency report shows disparities in the incidence of poverty risk by local authority area, with the highest incidence being recorded in the Border and West regions. Exploring the reasons for such spatial variations, the report found little evidence of a causal relationship between poverty and location per se. It found rather that the main factors determining poverty relate to the socio-economic composition of households, which in turn were influenced by structural factors such as lack of education, low-paid work, unemployment or non-participation in the labour force.The higher percentage levels of poverty in certain regions are also in part explained by the lower proportions of those who are well off in those regions, compared to other mainly urban regions. This is due mainly to the availability of higher paid jobs in urban regions and currently to a younger working population. The differing levels of house prices between regions are another indicator of these phenomena.The need to address the differences in the incidence of poverty between regional and local areas is reflected in the actions contained in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion). The overall aim of the NAPinclusion is to build viable and sustainable communities, improving the lives of people living in disadvantaged areas and building social capital. The Communities chapter of the Plan outlines a series of programmes that support disadvantaged local communities, which are designed to improve the quality of life and promote the social inclusion of all people, particularly those who may be vulnerable and isolated. Furthermore, at local authority level, social inclusion structures are being strengthened through the work of the Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The purpose of the Group is to promote and support the embedding of social inclusion in local government in the context of national policies. Moreover, in line with the commitment in Towards 2016, pilot social inclusion units have now been established in half of all county and city councils.Building on the progress already made in this regard, my priority, in working with Government, is to deliver the NAPinclusion programme over the coming years leading to significant improvements in living standards for those living in disadvantaged areas and addressing the disparities in poverty levels between regional and local areas.‘At risk of poverty’Consistent PovertyBMW RegionS&E RegionBMW RegionS&E RegionTotal26.213.79.25.5Male26.113.29.15.4Female26.314.29.35.6Source: CSO EU-SILC 2006†Based on 60% median income after social transfers.*Based on the revised definition of consistent poverty.Local Authority Area‘At risk of poverty’

He was evicted from Dublin City Council housing because of anti-social behaviour. Social welfare legislation provides that the Executive may determine that a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority, because of anti-social behaviour or in the interest of good estate management, shall not be entitled to payment of rent supplement.The Executive advises that the CWO has asked the person concerned to provide documentary evidence to support a claim for rent supplement and when this is received, his entitlement will be fully examined.

In general, to qualify for a back to education allowance (second level option) a person must be 21 years of age.  Exceptions to this condition are made if the applicant has been out of formal education for two years; or has been made redundant and has received statutory redundancy payments.  These criteria do not apply in his case.  He is, therefore, not eligible for the allowance at this time.   He is currently in receipt of a jobseeker's allowance payment at the weekly rate of €197.80.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	900	The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package which also includes the electricity/gas allowance and free television licence schemes. The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare disability payments or carer's allowance. There are currently in the region of 355,000 people in receipt of the household benefits at an annual cost of €317 million.The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security. A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.  The Department has endeavoured to meet the demands of de-regulation, notably in the telecoms market, where it supports multiple providers within the fixed line telephone business.A restructuring of the telephone allowance to a cash value was undertaken in 2003 and this has facilitated the inclusion of additional providers in the scheme since July 2004. The scheme was further extended to include mobile phones in April 2007 as a result of improvements announced in Budget 2007.  Since then, people have the choice of either opting for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline or for a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone. This means that it is no longer necessary for a person to have a fixed line phone in order to benefit from the telephone allowance. There are currently approximately 15,000 people availing of the mobile phone option.It should be noted that where people access the internet using a landline, the telephone allowance applies to their bill usage and will cover the cost of calls or internet usage up to the level of their allowance.

She appealed this decision on 5 March 2008 and, in the context of this appeal, she was examined by a second Medical Assessor on 24 April 2008 who also expressed the opinion that she was medically unsuitable for disability allowance.I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in the light of this second medical opinion, she was afforded an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal and to furnish any further medical evidence she wished to submit.  Her reply, along with further medical evidence was sent to the Chief Medical Advisor, who expressed the opinion that this evidence would not affect the previous findings by the Medical Assessors.In accordance with the statutory requirements, the Department was asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer's comments on the grounds of the appeal.These were returned to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the case has now been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing.  The person concerned will be informed when arrangements have been made.

Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The Dublin/Mid Leinster area of the HSE has advised that it has no record of a claim for an exceptional needs payment from the person concerned.  If the person wishes to claim such a payment they should contact their local community welfare officer.

The CWO interviews the claimant when they first present to enquire about their possible entitlement for mortgage interest supplement.  Claim details are recorded electronically only in cases where it is established that mortgage interest supplement is payable.  Statistics are not held on the number of people refused mortgage interest supplement.

The Civil Defence Board was established on the 7th May 2003 following the enactment of the Civil Defence Act 2002.   Prior to that date, Civil Defence had been a branch of my Department — the relevant staff transferred to the Civil Defence Board following its establishment.Information requested by the Deputy on staffing levels and budgets is as follows:YearBudget since EstablishmentNumber of Staff€20035,579,0002520045,593,0002220055,767,0002020065,928,0002120076,099,0002920086,248,00028

On completion of the list the areas which impose the biggest burden on businesses, if any, will be prioritised. Until the list is complete I am unable to give a timeframe on the measurement of the cost of these burdens or the proposals to reduce the burdens, if any, to be  made, as at this point in time their nature and complexity is not known. However the Department will be adhering to the timeframe laid down by the Dept of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to this.

This deployment of the Defence Forces, and specifically the Army, has been determined predominantly by historical factors.The Defence property portfolio is kept under ongoing review by military authorities and the staff in my Department to ensure the most effective use of military resources having regard to the roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces. This includes ongoing review of the organisation, structure and formation of the forces and the consequential requirement for military barracks and other properties. Any properties which are deemed to be surplus to military requirements will be disposed of and the funding invested to meet the current and future equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	909	The individual concerned was retired, by the President, on the advice of the Government with effect from a date in June, 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to Section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired "in the interests of the service". The Deputy will appreciate that a decision to retire an officer "in the interests of the service" is only taken for the most compelling reasons. The Government advice to the President in 1969 was on grounds of security. I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision taken then was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 in relation to the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings. The individual appealed to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court refused the appeal in January 2001.In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case, published on 29th June 2002, the then Minister requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and to review the case.  The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned, by reference to the entirety of both the Department of Defence and the military files in the matter. Her report was submitted to the then Minister in mid September, 2002 and was published in October, 2002.In December 2002 the individual applied to the High Court for an order quashing this report by the Judge Advocate General. The High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgement on his application. The High Court judgement of 27th July 2005 related only to the report completed by the civilian Judge Advocate General in September 2002. The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Quirke, held that that report should be quashed because fair procedures had not been applied in the compilation and production of that report and in the timing of the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the applicant. Mr. Justice Quirke concluded his judgement by stating that "The decision made in 1969 to recommend the Applicant's retirement from the Defence Forces remains unaffected by any Order made in these proceedings."It should be emphasized therefore that the High Court judgement in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically related to the actual procedures utilized by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002 and to the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the individual only after completion of the report. The individual concerned specifically did not seek an Order for mandamus from the High Court and therefore did not request the High Court to remit the matter or to direct a resumption of the Judge Advocate General's original enquiry, or to direct that a new enquiry be held by the Judge Advocate General or by any other person.The substantive issue, namely the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains unaffected by the judgement of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of the judgement itself.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to take any further action in relation to this matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	910	My Department's Sectoral plan, as provided for in section 36 of the Disability Act 2005, was developed in consultation with people with disabilities to assist the Department and local authorities in supporting an inclusive society with accessible buildings, facilities, services and information. There are statutory provisions, codes of practice and guidelines available to assist local authorities in providing the measures required in the Sectoral Plan. The "Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information Provided by Public Bodies", published by the National Disability Authority under section 30 of the Disability Act covers access to services provided by a public body and the provision of information to the public. This Code will assist local authorities in meeting their obligations under the Act.  The sectoral plan also refers to the Government's target of 3% for the employment of people with disabilities, which the local government sector has exceeded each year since 2001.My Department is represented on the Local Government Disability Act Steering Committee, which was established by the Local Government Management Services Board to promote consistent implementation of measures required under the Act.  It does so by addressing common issues across local authorities, updating best practice guidance, and organising staff seminars. The Committee's output includes the June 2006 Guidance Framework for Developing an Implementation Plan as well as the establishment of a Good Practice in Accessibility website to support local authority personnel implementing the National Disability Strategy. The website showcases good practice, provides practical answers to common queries, hosts a discussion forum and provides links to relevant published material.Local authority implementation plans are published and placed on their websites and are required to contain targets and timeframes for carrying out required works. Priority is given to local authority buildings and other facilities to which people with disabilities most frequently require access, including footpaths, public amenity areas, information and other services. My Department will have provided €58 million by the end of 2008 to assist local authorities in delivering high standards of access to people with disabilities and in carrying out actions under the National Disability Strategy.My Department has also established a Disability Act Sectoral Plan Advisory Committee.  This committee, comprised of representatives of the Department and bodies under its aegis, people with disabilities, the National Disability Authority and local authorities, provides a forum to review progress in the implementation of plans.With regard to the specific issue raised in the Question, my Department's Development Management Guidelines, issued in June 2007, state that planning authorities should consider whether it is necessary to add conditions to planning permissions for housing and commercial development to ensure access for all in the approach to buildings from the main road, street or disabled car parking. The Guidelines also state that the necessity to ensure that the design implications of accessibility are addressed should be brought to potential applicants' attention at pre-application consultation stage. They refer planning authorities to the National Disability Authority's 2002 publication "Building for Everyone" for examples of good practice. The Guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are obliged to have regard to them in the exercise of their functions under the Act.

The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of rural communities and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing public sewerage networks.New infrastructure under the pilot programme has now been commissioned and its performance is being monitored and evaluated.  The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee has been asked to report to me on the results as they become available and will be reassessing the grants for group sewerage schemes in light of the outcome.

This licensing system enables a local authority to exercise control over the placing of structures on roads to prevent traffic hazards arising.The Planning and Development Regulations, 2001, prescribe the level of fees to be charged in respect of structures and appliances licensed under Section 254 of the 2000 Act.  The Regulations prescribe a fee of €630 for an advertisement structure or €50 in the case of an advertisement structure that is of a fingerpost type not exceeding 1 metre in length, consisting of a direction sign to indicate tourist accommodation.  I have no proposals at this time to amend this legislation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	919	I refer to the reply to Question No. 1395 of 24 September 2008.In my role as a statutory consultee on draft development plans and as part of the public consultation processes on the Mayo County Development Plan at draft and material amendment stages, my Department expressed serious concerns that the draft county settlement strategy did not accord adequate priority to the development of residentially zoned lands in the National Spatial Strategy linked hub of Castlebar-Ballina.   Concerns were also raised that the rural settlement policy framework as proposed in the amended draft plan did not set out a proper strategy for the management of housing proposals in rural areas as recommended in the 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for Planning Authorities.As the Council did not address these concerns and in order to ensure the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, I issued a Direction to the Council on 11 July 2008 under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, requiring the Council to vary their Plan and, inter alia, to revert to the rural settlement policies and mechanisms devised and approved by Mayo County Council itself in the original draft Development Plan.My Department has been in contact with officials from Mayo County Council regarding implementation of the Direction and I understand that preparations are under way in the County Council to amend the Plan accordingly.

It was made clear from the beginning of the public consultation process on the proposed changes, in December 2006, that the proposals would not be made retrospective to the existing car fleet.The question of applying the new CO2 based motor tax system to all cars was subject to further detailed debate on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2008.  As was indicated in the debate, the rates under the CO2 system were determined on a revenue neutral basis so as not to undermine the monies available to the Local Government Fund.  In addition, it was pointed out that any retrospection would not be practicable, as the CO2 data for the car fleet had not been authenticated for business purposes.  The cost of any retrospection, were it possible, could be substantial, depending on how it applied, and could have direct implications for the revenue base of Local Government.

The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which was presented to the Seanad on 23 July 2008, did not include provision for the tenant purchase of local authority apartments as it was not possible to resolve the complex issues involved in time for publication.  Work is continuing to address the outstanding issues with a view to presenting proposals for a viable apartment sales scheme during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.

A BER certificate will be required for a building of any class in existence, including a dwelling, for sale or letting on or after 1 January 2009, unless otherwise exempted — for example, in the case of a national monument or a protected structure.BER certificates are issued by qualified BER assessors who have completed the necessary training and have been registered by the issuing authority, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), to carry out the assessment of buildings.

A review is also currently underway to identify realisable but ambitious targets for improvements in primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions for buildings other than dwellings, which will also take effect in 2010.  All proposals in this regard, including any transitional implementation arrangements which may be appropriate in the context of planning permissions, will be progressed in consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body, a statutory body which includes representation from a broad cross-section of the construction industry, and will entail a public consultation process.

To obtain the Ecolabel, products and services must meet stringent environmental criteria agreed at European level.  Under the present scheme, criteria have been established in respect of 26 product groups including all-purpose cleaners, handwashing and dishwashing detergents.

It provides grants for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit and which are in civic ownership or occupation and generally open to the public.Significant Places of Public Worship SchemeThe scheme is administered by the Heritage Council on behalf of the Department. It provides grant assistance for major conservation works at places of public worship which are of significant architectural merit.Buildings at Risk SchemeThe Department provides an allocation to the Heritage Council for capital grants. This scheme provides grant assistance to carry out essential repairs to buildings of architectural significance — much of the funding is committed to projects for the repair of the roofs of such buildings.Local Authorities Conservation Grants SchemeThe scheme is administered by the local authorities on behalf of the Department. It provides grant assistance for the conservation of protected buildings i.e. those buildings which are on the local authority’s list of Protected Structures.My Department's civic structures conservation grant scheme for 2008 is funding a project, as follows in County Mayo:ProjectLocationGrant AmountSt. Michael’s Church of IrelandChurch Road, Ballina,Co.

The last assessment took place in 2005 and indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  1,301 of these households were on waiting lists of housing authorities in County Mayo; further information is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  Housing authorities have recently completed the 2008 assessment of housing need, the results of which will be published as soon as possible.This information on housing need has been a major consideration in the allocation of exchequer resources for the national social housing investment programme.  This year alone, my Department has allocated almost €20 million to support social housing construction projects across County Mayo.

A clawback provision is in place to protect the State's interest in the house and to ensure that there is no short-term profit taking on the resale of an affordable house.The legal provisions relating to affordable housing under the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 provide that the clawback must be based on the market value of the property at the time of sale to the person purchasing the property, and in the case of the Shared Ownership Scheme it is based on the date of grant of the shared ownership lease.  This clawback is expressed as the percentage discount received when the house was originally sold and is applied to the subsequent resale price.Where the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of the sale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.

There are well established occupational health and safety protocols for working with such materials.Insulation materials generally are not designed for direct exposure to an inhabited space.  They are usually left exposed in a ventilated and unoccupied attic space.  It is established recommended health and safety practice that homeowners use a dust mask when visiting such an attic space.I am also advised that in the case of a converted or occupied attic space, or the walls of a living space, insulation materials should be properly sealed behind suitable barriers such as plasterboard in the interests of health and safety and the environment.

This is a national initiative being co-ordinated by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment with his Department as lead Department.The first phase of the programme involves detailing administrative simplifications already achieved and setting out the legislation under the aegis of all Departments for analysis and measurement of the administrative burdens involved.  This phase is already under way in my Department and a senior official has been assigned to oversee our contribution to the project.It is expected that the identification, prioritisation and measurement process should be completed by all Departments by the end of 2009 and my Department is working towards that deadline.In common with all Departments, my Department is liaising closely with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment to ensure a consistent approach across the whole of Government.  I understand that once the measurement exercise is finalised detailed plans will be set out on meeting the national 25% reduction target by the end of 2012.

All 27 are operational and open for business in Carlow, Cork, Letterkenny, Gweedore, Galway, Kilkenny, Portlaoise, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton, Limerick, Ballina, Kiltimagh, Tullamore, Roscommon, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Waterford, Mullingar, Athlone, Wexford, Dundalk, Drogheda, Carrickmacross, Monaghan, Cavan, Kingscourt and Sligo.  There are no Phase I MANs in Counties Kerry and Clare.Under Phase II of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme an additional 60 MANs covering 66 towns are almost completed, which are detailed in the table herewith.Service providers are deemed as "customers" of the MANs.  In other words, a Service Provider, as a customer of a MAN, uses the MAN to offer services on to the Service Provider's own customers.  34 service providers are offering services on the Phase I MANs, using them to compete for voice and data services over a range of platforms including:Unbundled local loop;Mobile wireless;Fixed wireless;Cable;Partial private circuits; andDirectly connected fibre.Information relating to the use of the MANs by service providers, including the numbers of customers served by each service provider is commercially sensitive and a matter for each service provider.RegionMANTownCorkBantryBantryCorkBlarneyBlarneyCorkCarrigaline LoopCarragalineCorkCarrigaline LoopPassage WestCorkCarrigaline LoopRingaskiddyCorkCharlevilleCharlevilleCorkDunmanwayDunmanwayCorkFermoyFermoyCorkKanturkKanturkCorkKinsaleKinsaleCorkMidletonMidletonCorkMitchelstownMitchelstownCorkSkibbereenSkibbereenCorkYoughalYoughalDonegalBallybofey/StranorlarBallybofeyDonegalBallybofey/StranorlarStranorlarDonegalBallyshannonBallyshannonDonegalBuncranaBuncranaDonegalBundoranBundoranDonegalCarndonaghCarndonaghDonegalDonegal TownDonegal TownGalwayAthenryAthenryGalwayBallinasloeBallinasloeGalwayClifdenClifdenGalwayGortGortGalwayLoughreaLoughreaLongfordLongfordLongfordMeathDunboyne / CloneeDunboyneMeathDunboyne / CloneeCloneeMeathDunshaughlinDunshaughlinMeathKellsKellsMeathNavanNavanMeathTrimTrimMidlandsEdenderryEdenderryNorth EastArdeeArdeeNorth EastBailieboroughBailieboroughNorth EastCastleblaneyCastleblaneyNorth EastClonesClonesNorth EastCootehillCootehillFingalDonabate/PortraneDonabateFingalDonabate/PortranePortraneFingalLuskLuskFingalSkerriesSkerriesWicklowBlessingtonBlessingtonWicklowKilcoole/NewtownmountkennedyKilcooleWicklowKilcoole/NewtownmountkennedyNewtownmountkennedySERACahirCahirSERACashelCashelSERACarrick on SuirCarrick on SuirSERATipperaryTipperarySERAThomastownThomastownMayoBallinasloeBallinasloeMayoKnock AirportKnock AirportMayoClaremorrisClaremorrisKerryKillarneyKillarneyKerryCastleislandCastleislandKerryTraleeTraleeKerryListowelListowelShannonAbbeyfealeAbbeyfealeShannonBanagherBanagherShannonBirrBirrShannonKilrushKilrushShannonNenaghNenaghShannonNewcastlewestNewcastlewestShannonRoscreaRoscreaShannonTemplemoreTemplemore13 Regions60 MANs66 Towns

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I have no role in private sector broadband infrastructure investment undertaken by broadband service providers.The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard, my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS), investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) which is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.Over the last two years three Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) have been constructed in the Dublin area under Phase II of the MANs programme.  These are Donabate/Portrane, Lusk and Skerries, all three built in partnership with Fingal County Council.

These measures form a comprehensive package of support to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.Good progress is being made in implementing the various measures.  These include the following.National ReservePayments of an additional €6m to qualifying sheep farmers were issued under the 2007 National Reserve.REPSMy Department secured European Commission approval for a new supplementary measure in REPS 4 promoting mixed grazing of cattle and sheep.  Under this supplementary measure a farmer can qualify for an annual payment of up to €1,000 in addition to his or her basic REPS payment.Breed Improvement ProgrammeAn Interim Sheep Breeding Board has been established representing my Department, pedigree breeders and producers and responsibility for the Pedigree Sheep Breed Improvement programme is currently being transferred to ICBFMechanical GradingTrials have been carried out on the use of new technology to allow for the mechanical grading of carcases in the sheepmeat sector and the results are being assessed.Lamb Quality Assurance SchemeThe lamb quality assurance scheme, which was established in 2007, has seen some 6,000 farms being registered to date.Bord BiaBord Bia is continuing to organise strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets.  Along with its French and British counterparts Bord Bia is undertaking a three-year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.TeagascTeagasc have developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.These measures complement those to be taken by the industry itself in implementation of the Malone Report.  I am satisfied that my Department is dealing satisfactorily with the areas of the report within its remit.At EU level, the proposals in the Aylward Report to assist the sector were considered at a conference in Limoges, on 4 and 5 September which I attended.  At that conference I made known my concerns for the future of the sheep industry both in Ireland and in Europe and fully supported moves by the French Presidency to pursue possible solutions to help the sector.

I would expect that payment will be made in the near future provided that the claim is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	954	My Department has wide-ranging initiatives in place for the assistance of farmers in agricultural production including, inter alia, disease eradication programmes, animal welfare schemes, quality assurance schemes and REPS. All these schemes contribute to the production of quality products be they organic or non-organic.An Bord Bia carries out a series of food promotion initiatives on an ongoing basis. In addition, Teagasc has a major advisory and training programme in place covering all types of farming and food production.In relation to organic production in particular, the Programme for Government has set a target to convert a minimum 5% of acreage to organic farmland by 2012. In response, my Department launched its Organic Farming Action Plan 2008–2012 earlier this year. The Plan aims to increase production in line with market trends, to increase the knowledge base, to develop the organic market at home and abroad and to encourage the development of public procurement opportunities for organic products.My Department, in conjunction with An Bord Bia, held a National Organic Week from 15th to 21st September 2008 to promote the consumption of organic food as well as encouraging farmers to enter into organic food production.  2008 was the 4th year of National Organic Week and the event has greatly contributed to an increased awareness of organic produce and its benefits.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	955	National Organic Week, now in its fourth year, is an important event and serves to raise awareness among consumers about what organic food and farming is all about and where they can get organic produce.  National Organic Week ran this year from 15 to 21 September and a wide range of events took place nationwide.  The total cost to my Department will be in the region of €280,000.There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the land area under organic production to 5% of the total utilisable agriculture area by 2012.  This projected increase, from 1% currently, has to be market-driven and that is why events such as National Organic Week are very important, not only in raising awareness of organic food, but also in increasing sales of locally produced organic food.

This means that the entire value of any such national retirement pension awarded from age 66 must be deducted from the Early Retirement Pension.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for devising the approach and methodology to be used across Government, for co-ordinating this work across Government Departments and agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.At present, my officials are engaged in the process of screening information obligations that come under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  When completed, an exercise in prioritising these information obligations will be undertaken with the assistance of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment by the end of 2008.During 2009, measurements of these prioritised information obligations will be undertaken and when completed simplification plans will be prepared detailing those steps necessary to reduce burden.

Prompted by the very wet summer, which seriously affected farming, I approached the Agriculture Commissioner seeking agreement to an early advance 50% payment, in line with arrangements agreed for the 2007 scheme. I am pleased to say that the necessary approval was readily forthcoming and payments are now scheduled to begin issuing on 16 October, the first day of the new EU financial year.The advance payment for the person named, in respect of the 2008 Single Payment Scheme, will be among those issuing from 16 October.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	961	While under the EU regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme, the earliest date payments may issue is 1 December of the scheme-year concerned, provision is also made for payments to be made earlier, subject to EU approval. Prompted by the very wet summer, which seriously affected farming, I approached the Agriculture Commissioner seeking agreement to an early advance 50% payment, in line with arrangements agreed for the 2007 scheme. I am pleased to say that the necessary approval was readily forthcoming and payments are now scheduled to begin issuing on 16 October, the first day of the new EU financial year.  The advance payment for the person named, in respect of the 2008 Single Payment Scheme, will be among those issuing from 16 October. Balancing payments will begin to issue from 1 December.

The amount allocated was indicative and based on the likely take up, if farmers changed to REPS 4. However the majority of farmers in REPS 3  are seeing out their contracts and the take up in REPS 4 of qualifying farmers has been low.At EU level, the proposals in the Aylward Report to assist the sector were considered at a conference in Limoges, on 4 and 5 September which I attended.  At that conference I made known my concerns for the future of the sheep industry both in Ireland and in Europe and fully supported moves by the French Presidency to pursue possible solutions to help the sector.

In line with these requirements details of expenditure in relation to the Single Payment Scheme will be published on the Department's website by 30th April 2009.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	965	I share the Deputy's views on the significance of the forestry sector from an economic development and a climate change perspective and, more specifically, the importance of the suite of forestry schemes administered by my Department.Sufficient funds are available to finance the expected new planting in 2008 and the Afforestation Scheme is operating as usual.  Demand for all the forestry schemes has been quite high this year, relative to the funds available, and this is particularly true of all the forestry support schemes.  My Department is currently accepting and processing applications for these support schemes but, unfortunately, cannot commit funding to individual projects at this stage. The overall forestry situation will be reviewed when the funding position for 2009 is clarified.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	966	The outwintering of cattle, which allows for all-year grazing, is permitted in REPS. With regard to organic cattle production, access to outdoor areas, preferably grazing lands, whenever weather conditions and the state of the ground allow, is very much encouraged by the EU regulations.  Winter grazing, whether using continental or traditional breeds, must of course always be operated in compliance with the requirements of Cross-Compliance.

The requirement for the five-year declaration by the REPS applicant on IACS may be dispensed with where a young farmer is approved for setting up aid under article 22 of Regulation 1698/2005, or where a holding is transferred under the Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming.

As the requested transfer was by way of inheritance, it was necessary to request the normal testamentary documentation. It was also necessary to advise the person named of the need to transfer the herd number into her name before the transfer could be completed. The herd number was subsequently transferred in June 2008 and, having received all necessary documentation, the requested transfer of entitlements has now been processed.

In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling.  The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation.  At the relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13th October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland's proposed regulations.

Some of those that made submissions asked for an opportunity to elaborate on issues in the draft legislation and I am now finalising the format of such further consultation.  Following completion of this process, arrangements will proceed with drafting the legislation having regard to all comments received.  Arrangements will be made in due course to include the names of those that made submissions on the draft Bill on the Department's website.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	977	The relevant educational qualifications for the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme are set out in Appendix 2 to the Scheme.  A Degree in Agri-Environmental Science awarded by UCD is not a specific qualification for the purposes of this Scheme.Teagasc has examined the Agri-Environmental Science Degree and has taken the view that it does not have sufficient production agriculture and farm business management content in the core modules to meet the requirements of the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme.  However, my Department has recognized that some students may have chosen production agriculture and farm business management as their options/electives in the degree programme.  Teagasc and UCD have agreed on a list of options/electives, when achieved as components of, or additions to the Agri-Environmental Science Degree that will enable Teagasc to issue letters of equivalence for the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme.I would suggest that any individual with concerns about this Degree contacts my Department to determine, firstly, if the options/electives completed meet the above requirements and, secondly, what additional options/electives must be undertaken in order to meet the qualification requirements for the Young Farmers' Installation Scheme.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	980	Agreement has been reached between the trustees of the three existing post-primary schools in Skibbereen to amalgamate into a single school.The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works was requested to source a site for the development of a single school.  A number of sites were identified and examined.  Those considered potentially suitable for the provision of a school building for the amalgamation were then discussed with Cork County Council.Following that exercise and to date, no site has been identified that is suitable from the perspectives of my Department, the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council.Because of the difficulty in sourcing a green field site the Department decided to investigate the possibility of utilising the Rossa College site to facilitate the proposed building project.  To this end a feasibility study of the site and building was commissioned in order to determine how best to provide for the long-term accommodation needs of the proposed school.  However, because of the opposition from the Trustees of the proposed new Community School to the Rossa College site, this option is no longer being pursued.  The Department will continue to work to identify a suitable site for this project and will keep the Trustees informed of progress in this regard.

That is why my Department introduced prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners in 2004. As part of the assessment of all applications for capital funding by the Planning and Building Unit of my Department, each project is assigned a band rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects as set out below . Projects are then selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need which is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project. The information on the band ratings of projects in the school building and modernisation programme as requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables:Band 11.11.21.31.4TotalNumbers10525637173Band 22.12.22.32.42.52.6TotalNumbers6247175431184Band 33.13.23.33.43.5TotalNumbers001001Band 44.14.24.34.4TotalNumbers70007Grand total365CountyBand 1Band 2Band 3Band 4Carlow1500Cavan3400Clare1300Cork City2501Cork County61400Donegal10402Dublin Belgard10800Dublin City91301Dublin Fingal20500Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown61100Galway City7100Galway County11900Kerry2600Kildare15400Kilkenny4400Laois6500Leitrim0100Limerick City0400Limerick County4100Longford4400Louth9400Mayo2601Meath131001Monaghan0400Offaly4400Roscommon0300Sligo1200Tipperary N.R.1900Tipperary S.R.4301Waterford City5200Waterford County3400Westmeath4800Wexford5700Wicklow1710Totals17318417
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	983	The main findings of the audit of school enrolment policies have been made publicly available on my Department's website. The findings are published in a format that does not allow individual schools to be identified while enabling the overall pattern of practice to be assessed. Naming schools may have a perverse impact, whereby schools that are living up to their responsibilities to the full community may become ‘labelled' on the basis of their willingness to accommodate pupils of all backgrounds. On the other hand, schools that are avoiding their responsibilities may be seen as more attractive to some parents.At a general level, the audit finds no evidence of problematic enrolment practice on a system-wide scale. However, in assessing enrolment practice on the basis of local school clusters, it identifies pockets of inconsistent activity which would indicate that certain schools may be assuming disproportionate shares of responsibility for enrolling children of all backgrounds and needs from within their local community. The issues are more pronounced at second-level than at primary level (where disparities can be largely accounted for by localised factors). Further to the audit, the education partners were invited to submit their views on desirable changes to existing practices. This included possible arrangements to address issues that arise at a local level in relation to enrolment practice and potential regulatory measures to address discriminatory school written enrolment policy provisions. I am now reflecting on these submissions and will consider bringing forward relevant policy proposals.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	984	The Early Start Programme, which was launched in the mid 1990s is a preschool intervention for 3 year old educationally disadvantaged children in 40 locations. The Early Start programme operates for 2.5 hours a day, 5 days a week for the duration of the school year, i.e., 183 days. Since the introduction of this programme, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education and the National Children's Strategy 2000 set out Government policy in the area of early childhood education. The policy set out in the National Children's Strategy aims to ensure that children's early education and developmental needs are met through quality child care services and family-friendly employment measures. The White Paper on Early Childhood Education identified a key role for my Department in improving the quality of educational provision in child care settings. The White Paper set out the key tenet that my Department would support the growth of, rather than replace, the wide range of existing provision in the early childhood area.State investment in early childhood education is now taking place through the National Childcare Investment Programme which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme. These programmes are administered through the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. My Department's role is to provide for quality within existing provision within the child care sector. It is not intended to extend the Early Start programme to other disadvantaged schools as it would mirror State investment in the preschool sector which is currently channelled through the National Childcare Investment Programme.

Standardised testing is used as one of a range of modes of assessment that help teachers to make more informed decisions in relation to teaching and learning. The results of standardised tests can be used to inform parents of pupils' progress and to assist in the identification of pupils that may require support.It was not intended that the results of standardised testing would be reported to the Department or used in any way which would facilitate school comparisons or the compilation of league tables. Instead, the implementation of standardised testing at school level is being complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring undertaken by the Educational Research Centre (ERC). The Educational Research Centre is conducting an evaluation of the School Support Programme under DEIS at primary and post-primary levels. Monitoring change in achievement and other pupil outcomes over the period 2006/07 to 2009/10 is one of a number of elements of the evaluation at primary level. The first phase of this element has been completed with the collection, in Spring of 2007, of baseline achievement data from about 17,000 pupils in a sample of almost 500 participating schools. Pupils took tests in English and mathematics and completed a questionnaire about their attitudes to school and about their leisure pursuits. In schools in the urban dimension of the SSP, pupils in second, third, and sixth class were involved. In schools in the rural dimension of the SSP, pupils in third and sixth class were involved. Testing will be repeated in the same schools and with many of the same pupils in the Spring of 2010.The ERC is also currently engaged in development and pilot testing preparatory to national implementation of a programme of national monitoring in English Reading and Mathematics which will be undertaken in 2009, targeted at pupils in second and sixth class. These programme will establish trends over time for particular categories of school, such as schools in DEIS, English medium schools and Irish medium schools. No individual school results will be identifiable in this process.

Such supports include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant (SNA) support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for pupils with special educational needs (SEN).At second level, approximately 2,750 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with SEN. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are over 560 whole time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,826 whole time equivalent SNAs in our second level schools.My Department supports the education of individual students with SEN in second level schools, including those experiencing difficulty with literacy and numeracy, throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. The organisation of such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision.  The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools' staff locally.Schools have access to external supports in supporting pupils with SEN such as that offered by the SESS and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. Schools will have reference to the guideline document "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" produced by my Department which provides practical advice and guidance to schools on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.I am confident that the range of supports in place to support pupils experiencing difficulty with literacy and numeracy are of major benefit in ensuring that these pupils receive the support they require.

The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.A central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, as well as control of costs and ensuring value for money.In this instance, having examined the application for additional funding, the Department is of the opinion that the project should be completed within the amount originally allocated and accordingly, further grant aid is refused.In the circumstances, the Board of Management is required to take the necessary steps to ensure that the scope of the works undertaken matches the funding being allowed.

A suitable site has been identified for the school in question. The site comprises of three plots of land with three separate vendors. Originally it was intended that my Department would acquire the required lands and negotiations were progressing on this basis. However earlier this year, the Patron of the school indicated that he was willing to acquire the lands directly. My officials subsequently met with the Patron to discuss the options open to advancing the proposed acquisition. At this point the Patron indicated that he was willing to acquire the lands subject to my Department giving a commitment in relation to the subsequent building project.The progression of this project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.In the meantime, my officials have agreed to meet with the school authorities to discuss and agree an approach to the immediate accommodation pressures arising.

The school projects were tendered under the GDLA form of contract based on a fixed price model. As has been standard under this model of fixed price tendering, used by my Department, the contract sum includes a contingency sum equivalent to 2% of the tender amount. In my Department's experience, this level of contingency is usually sufficient to cover most eventualities.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	993	My Department agreed to fund the full cost of developing specifications for the retrofitting of seat belts in line with the guidelines published by the  Department of Transport in June 2006, to both the Bus Éireann school bus fleet and to buses owned by private operators on contract to Bus Éireann under the school transport scheme.  Eighteen specifications were developed using Bus Éireann school buses and forty-seven specifications were developed using private contractors' buses, the full cost of which was met by my Department.  In cases where private contractors' buses were subjected to the standard pull-test, the full cost of carrying out the test and fitting the bus with seat belts was met by my Department.In addition, the full cost of retrofitting the Bus Éireann school buses, based on the guidelines published by the Department of Transport in June 2006, was met by my Department.  Provision was also made to grant-aid private contractors who retrofitted their buses with seat belts to the same standard utilising the specifications that were developed in this programme.  In general, the grant aid payable to private contractors was equivalent to half the cost of retrofitting seat belts subject to a maximum of €3,000 for a large bus.Bus Éireann has informed my Department that approximately 650 of their school bus fleet were retrofitted with seat belts in this programme and in the region of 100 buses owned by the private contractors were included in the programme.The cost to-date of the safety belt programme for buses under the school transport scheme is approximately €6.4 million — €5 million for the Bus Éireann school bus fleet and €1.4 million for private contractors buses.  The amount includes costs associated with the development of pull test specifications, retrofitting of safety belts and inspections of safety belts fitted to school buses.

The Circular is also available on my Department's website.The Primary School curriculum is designed as an eight year course, including a two year infant cycle followed by six years in standards from first to sixth, with children progressing to the next grade at the end of each school year.  The primary curriculum is flexible and child-centred, and can be adapted to meet children's needs.  In addition my Department is providing considerable support for pupils with learning difficulties in schools.  Learning support teachers, resource teachers, special needs assistants and a wide range of resources under the various schemes for schools in areas designated as disadvantaged are among the forms of provision allocated to schools for these pupils.  The level of provision available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school along with their peers.Under my Department's policy, children should only be allowed to repeat a year for educational reasons and in exceptional circumstances.  In such exceptional circumstances a Principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher/resource teacher and class teacher and parent(s) may conclude that a pupil would benefit educationally by repeating a grade level.  A record outlining the educational basis for the decision to retain a child should be kept for any pupil so retained.  In addition, there should be a clear programme outlined for such a pupil that records precisely what new approach will be used  for her/him and what its expected benefit will be.  No pupil should repeat a grade more than once in a primary school.Under my Department's policy, in no circumstances should an additional grade level (middle infants or a repeat sixth class) operate through the retention of all or a substantial number of pupils for a second year at a grade level.In addition, pupils who have completed sixth class must not transfer to another primary school to repeat sixth class. In the event that a school were to enrol pupils from another school to repeat sixth class the pupils shall not be included as eligible pupils for staffing and other purposes.  Capitation and other grants in respect of such pupils shall not be paid.

We are moving, and must move, towards an all-trained teaching profession, which is the desired situation.I have indicated my intention to commence Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act in the near future. I have also indicated that the commencement of the section will also provide for it to be regulated that a school may employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in extreme circumstances.While I and my Department and indeed the Teaching Council agree on the desirability of having a fully qualified and registered teaching cohort, I believe that the above proposed legislative arrangement reflects the situation facing schools today where it is not always possible, for a variety of reasons, to engage a registered teacher for substitution duty. It is my duty as Minister to protect our schools, students and the teaching profession. I consider this course of action to be the best way to achieve that, taking into account the realities of the situation.The person concerned is correct in identifying the fact that there are a number of personnel registered with the Teaching Council who are not qualified teachers. Untrained substitutes have historically fulfilled an important role in schools and Section 31 of the Act entitled personnel employed as teachers in schools at the establishment day of the Teaching Council to be registered as teachers. In time, with the commencement of Section 30, the numbers in this category will fall and eventually be eliminated.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

The provision of a principal's office for larger primary schools and general office/administration space for smaller primary schools is included in the design brief for new schools and/or renovation/extension school building projects. This is being done through the Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme and special schemes within available resources.My Department has not compiled information on the number of schools that do not have a principal's office.  Priority is given to improving conditions in schools on the basis of the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	1023	In 2007, my Department introduced the Special Education Needs Initiative (SENI) to address special educational needs and provide the necessary supports for learners in Youthreach centres.  The SENI involves a general allocation model similar to that introduced in the primary sector in September 2005. Its purpose is: to allow for a measured systematic development of professional practice in special education needs support in centres; and to introduce the practices of profiling and assessment into each centre, development of individual learning plans for each student, establishment of a mentoring support system and engagement in inter-agency work as required for each student.It was introduced to 25 groups of 25 learners across 20 Youthreach centres.  The initiative has taken a whole centre approach and the needs of all learners are identified using a profiling model. It is team based and caters mainly for students with high incidence needs.  It provides for the allocation of increased staffing hours to deal with the special needs and disabilities of all the students.  Additional training was provided to staff in the centres to enable the introduction, on a centre team basis, of a range of professional practices to support students with special educational needs/disabilities.  This training followed on from the national introductory training programme introduced into all centres in 2006. In addition, the 20 centres have access to a password protected internet site containing guidelines, tailored training programmes and other materials.During 2007, an evaluation was carried out on the SENI to determine its suitability and effectiveness for the learners.  The findings of this evaluation were generally positive and found the SENI to be meeting the needs of learners.Any consideration of the extension of the SENI to other Youthreach centres, including Listowel Youthreach, will have to take account of the present and prospective economic and budgetary context and related financial constraints.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	1026	The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second chance education initiative which is funded by my Department for unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months.  It is operated through the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.VTOS centres operate for up to 43 weeks each year to facilitate student participation in courses, as part of the learner-centred approach of further education, and or examinations.  In such cases VTOS coordinators are entitled to receive an honorarium for additional attendance.  This arrangement is set out in the Management Structure for VTOS Circular letter 45/99, paragraph 3.4. which states, "the coordinator will be required to be in attendance for the full duration of the VTOS course as specified by the VEC.  The prison honorarium will be payable pro rata in respect of extra summer attendance over that pertaining in the normal school year of 167 days”.  Where a VTOS centre is not open beyond the normal school year this honorarium payment does not apply as no extra attendance is required.  The duration of the VTOS academic year is a matter for each VEC.
