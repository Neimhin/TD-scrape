#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	We can see that local authorities are not building houses at the rate one would hope. In quarter 2 of 2017, 76% of completions were by approved housing bodies. Of the sites started at that time, 63% were by approved housing bodies. There appears to be an over-reliance on approved housing bodies. I know the question has been put to EUROSTAT, which is investigating the fact that these bodies and the funding associated with them are off-balance sheet. If that is proven to be the case, what provision have local authorities made to ramp up the provision of local authority housing by local authorities themselves? Looking at the statistics it appears to be Government policy to predominantly allow approved housing bodies to be the ones building homes currently rather than local authorities.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is responsible under EU law for the reporting of Government finance statistics, including deficit and debt. It is currently undertaking a review to determine whether the approved housing body, AHB, sector or part of it should be included as part of the general Government sector and whether AHBs should be classified as on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet for Government accounting purposes in accordance with EU rules. Under a previous review of the sector in 2014, the CSO classified these entities as being outside of the general Government sector. It indicated at the time that the status of these bodies would be reviewed if there was a change in the relationship with the housing authorities, that is, local authorities, or any other Government body. In October 2016, EUROSTAT requested the CSO to review the classification of AHBs expressing the view that the role of Government financing should be given greater weight in the classification decision than had been the case at the time of the 2014 review.  My Department has been engaging with the CSO on the review while respecting the independence of that office. We are keeping the matter of the potential reclassification of the AHB sector or part of it and its implications under continuous assessment and the Cabinet was also briefed on the issue in July 2017. However, until the CSO's examination is completed and the factors underlying the position to be adopted by the CSO become clear, I will not be in a position to assess the full impact of any decision arising from the review.  It is not the case that there is an over-reliance on AHBs. We have stressed at every local authority meeting with councillors of all parties and officials that we expect local authorities to be the lead in delivering housing. The AHB sector accounts for about one third of the planned delivery over the next four or five years under Rebuilding Ireland. That is very clear with less than 17,000 direct build, acquire or lease units through all the various schemes.  Regarding the pipeline of projects, the Deputy's concern is what the local authorities will do if this becomes an issue. We have clearly told local authorities to bring forward a greater pipeline of projects across the board. They have a pipeline of about 12,000 units. To put the Deputy's mind at ease on this issue, we have asked them to at least treble that so we have asked them to put them into the projects pipeline so the capacity to deliver will not be affected by any decision by the CSO or EUROSTAT on this issue in the year ahead. To be very clear, local authorities are the main body to deliver social housing on behalf of the State.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I have a direct question. In the event of this being adjudicated to be off-balance sheet by EUROSTAT, can the fiscal space cope with the increase in funding that would be required? The Minister of State has intimated to us that he is asking local authorities to redouble their efforts and ensure that they are the lead agency regarding the provision of houses and that funding is not an issue or an obstacle to them becoming that lead agency and providing the sort of units and numbers of units we deserve. That is one thing. It is the public pronouncement we hear week after week but if we look at the facts associated with the Government's programme, we will see that 76% of what is being built in quarter 2 of 2017 is by AHBs. With regard to sites that have commenced in quarter two of 2017, 63% are by AHBs and with regard to what is being tendered for, the percentage relating to AHBs is 73%, so the facts do not bear out the Minister of State's pronouncements. The facts will have to come into line with pronouncements eventually. If, despite the Minister of State's pronouncements, commitments and what he has told us on a continuous basis, there is no capacity there to address this then let us find a different way to proceed. The Minister of State spoke about re-purposing NAMA at one time with a view to it possibly contracting builders to provide local authority houses and for them to be leased over 70 years or whatever the case may be, but we have heard no more about that. We heard in the budget about €750 million being provided for builders to provide social housing units but we have heard no more about that either. The Government might be getting the kickback in respect of its announcements but the people on the ground are not seeing results. We are not seeing action to match the rhetoric.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I disagree with that. AHBs are partners in the delivery of social housing. We are very clear on this. The target is over 50,000 social houses built on behalf of the State in the years ahead. Local authorities will account for the majority of those house while AHBs will account for about 17,000 in total across all the various schemes. They have about 5,000 units coming through the pipeline on 300 sites but over 720 sites are being planned that will deliver over 12,000 houses by local authorities.I agree with Deputy Cowen that we want the local authorities to do more in this space. We have asked them to do so and their capacity has been strengthened in terms of resources, people, and finance. We have also put in place a new delivery team and agreed a new timeline of 59 weeks to be on-site with the housing, which is also in line with the private sector. This puts the local authorities in the position of being able to deliver the quantities of housing that they used to many years ago. Deputy Cowen is asking what happens if EUROSTAT makes a decision. The local authorities have been asked to increase their capacity every year over the next number of years. We will, then, be in a position to deliver our targets; that is not a concern for us. If the local authorities decide to operate either on- or off-balance sheet then we can deal with that. Capacity is being put back into the system to deliver housing. There will be an issue with funding and with the administration of balance sheets but we can deal with that. We will wait for the decision in the years ahead.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	The statistics bear out my contention that the Government is putting all its eggs, or at least 75% of them, into the one basket of approved housing bodies for delivering units to those on the ground. I accept that many people who are waiting on housing and who want to see progress on this matter do not care where the houses come from as long as they get one and as long as there is potential for hope. In the event of the Department's statistics indicating that this is on-balance sheet, has the Minister the funds available to meet the shortfall in terms of what he can provide? This shortfall will obviously become apparent at this point. The mantra put forward by the Minister and his colleagues is that money is not an object. It is certainly not an object when it comes to his commitment at this stage because it has taken between two to three years to get from inception to delivery. If this were happening at a greater pace, which I hope it will, can the Minister confirm that there is funding available to meet the shortfall so that local authorities can take up the mantle that the Minister says he wants them to? The Minister says that he wants the local authorities to be at the forefront of this but, based on the statistics, which do not lie, they are not there at the moment.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I want to deal with this myth that I have heard repeatedly from many of Fianna Fáil's own councillors as I go around the country, namely, that local authorities are not being made responsible for, or being put in the position to drive, local authority and social housing. They absolutely are. We are not solely dependent on approved housing bodies, even if Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors keep repeating this. This is not the case. I ask Deputy Cowen to look at the projections for the next three or four years. The approved housing body sector has been allocated less than one third of responsibility for this matter in the plans ahead. Let me very clear on this because it something that I hear repeatedly. It is a five-year plan and I urge Deputy Cowen to look at it. Yes, we have made it very clear that the fiscal space can deal with this, both in terms of the existing approved housing bodies and in terms of what we are looking at now, which is future funding.

We have asked local authorities to take the lead across the board and I again want to emphasise that they are all delivering social housing and that the supply of social housing has gone up for the last two years and now this year again. It will continue to go up in the years ahead. What we are trying to do is to achieve the target that everybody here wants to hear, which is 10,000 houses delivered per year. We will achieve this.

I have asked on a number of occasions for the Government to outline its definitions of affordable rental and affordable purchase; its targets in this regard for 2018; and the timeline for introducing an affordable housing scheme. Despite all the spin and announcements, we are still not getting answers to these very simple questions so I hope the Minister will oblige me in this regard this morning.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The Government acknowledges the affordability pressures faced by households with low to moderate incomes in particular parts of the country. It is precisely for that reason that Rebuilding Ireland has prioritised the supply of new homes to meet current and pent-up demand as well as helping to moderate house prices and rents. For households in the lowest income brackets, I am prioritising the social housing programme, with an additional capital allocation of €500 million over and above the €5.35 billion already committed under Rebuilding Ireland, to increase the overall delivery to 50,000 social housing homes by 2021. These households can also avail of other supports such as the housing assistance payment scheme. The Government has also put in place a range of measures to make housing more affordable. These include planning reforms, infrastructure funding to get key sites moving, the introduction of rent pressure zones, and mixed-tenure housing projects on publicly-owned land with two major sites in Dublin, encompassing some 1,500 new homes, progressing through procurement.  Based on all relevant indicators, it is clear that the supply-based measures are having a positive impact. Notwithstanding this, further measures are being developed, including with regard to apartment development viability. I am also considering the wider issue of housing affordability as part of the targeted review of Rebuilding Ireland, including the deployment of the funding of €25 million announced in budget 2018 to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable housing. I expect to be making a further announcement on this shortly.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	The Minister's answer is truly remarkable. While I know that he has only been in office for six months, I am really beginning to question whether or not he understands the extent of this particular issue and the extent of the pressures that people are under. According to every indicator, rents and house prices are increasing quarter on quarter and year on year. We are talking about the housing needs of working families on incomes somewhere between €35,000 and €75,000 a year. As I keep telling the Minister, supply alone will not resolve the problem without guarantees of affordability. The difficulty is that the measures that the Minister has just outlined combine to a total of €1.1 billion over three years to assist private sector delivery, with no guarantee of affordability. The scheme that the Minister has been promising to announce for a number of weeks now pledges approximately €25 million as compared to €1.1 billion. I again ask the questions and if the Minister does not have the answers then I ask that he be honest and tell us that. What is the Minister's definition of affordable rental? What is his definition of affordable sale? What are his targets for the delivery of those two streams of affordable housing for 2018? When will he introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to the affordable housing scheme that he promised both in the programme for Government and in Rebuilding Ireland?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I was quite clear about this both in my answer and in committee. We are about to announce an affordability scheme and it is being designed at the moment. I have met with bodies like Ó Cualann which have carried out affordability projects through running co-operative housing with local authorities, so as to see how we can draw up our own affordability scheme criteria. It is important to acknowledge here that we need to get the criteria right for accessing affordable homes. We are bringing back affordability. It had been stood down as part of social and affordable housing and we are now bringing it back. The most important thing is that the houses get built, and when they are built we will then have a scheme in place for every local authority to access. The allocation of €25 million announced in the budget is for 2018 and 2019 and will deliver at least 650 affordable homes using local authority sites. That is but the minimum of what we expect to deliver from that €25 million. I ask the Deputy to look at the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, funding to date. Of the €200 million allocated under LIHAF 1, 30% of the sites involved will include affordability schemes that can be accessed under the new affordability criteria scheme when it is announced. LIHAF 2 will have the same provisions available to it. With further regard to other sites, we do not limit local authorities in making arrangements for particular sites. If we look at what is going to be happening at O'Devaney Gardens, for example, additional affordability will be in place there, while an additional 15% of affordable housing is going to go up on the Poolbeg site. All these new homes will be affordable homes accessed by the new scheme which is currently being designed. The most important thing is that the homes are getting built. I hope to announce in the coming weeks the affordability scheme and the actual criteria for how it can be accessed. As I said before in committee, we are considering things like income limits as ways of deciding who would be eligible to get access for that scheme..

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	A possible 300.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	That is remarkable. Fine Gael has been in government for a year and a half. It signed a programme for Government 18 months ago that promised a cost-rental and an affordable housing scheme. I have no idea what the Minister means when he says that the LIHAF developments will include affordability. The last time he answered that question he told us that in Dublin, for example, that could mean €320,000, which is clearly not affordable by any measure. While I look forward to the Minister's announcement, Government needs to come forward and say that there is going to be a stream of rental accommodation and a stream of purchase accommodation that is accessible to people on incomes between €35,000 and approximately €75,000 for couples. The Minister needs to tell us exactly how many of those units will be delivered next year and the year after. If he comes back in two or three weeks' time to tell us that this figure amounts to 300 units based on the €25 million, €15 million of which will be spent next year, then that will be a mark of abject failure on his part. Once again he will have let down those working families who are in desperate need of affordable accommodation.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I ask Deputy Ó Broin not to deliberately misinterpret what I just said. What I said was that the €25 million that was secured from budget 2018 and 2019 would deliver a minimum of 650 homes. I also said that with regard to other sites, Poolbeg, for example, we will have an additional 15% of affordable units which will deliver approximately 350 homes.There is also an increase in O'Devaney Gardens. A number of schemes under LIHAF 1 will have affordability carve-outs in the affordable-to-rent and affordable-to-buy areas.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	The income criteria that will allow people to access these homes are being worked out in the context of the affordability scheme I am going to announce. We know that in 70% of LIHAF sites, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes will come in under €320,000. The vast majority of them will come in under €300,000.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I do not think €300,000 is affordable.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I ask the Deputy not to interrupt me. Of course affordability depends on a person's income. We intend to bring back the affordability measures that existed previously in the context of social and affordable housing. We will bring in a scheme for the cohort of people who are not eligible for social housing because their incomes are just above the limits and who cannot afford to buy because of the current rates of property price increases. I will announce the details of this affordability scheme very shortly.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	There is nothing more irritating for people than to see voids not being used. The Government has told us it is dealing with this issue by putting more people into such properties. It has provided certain numbers. What criteria are used when returned voids are being calculated? How many returned voids were there in 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017? I want to get a clear handle on that so I can appreciate whether what the Minister is saying is correct. There are contradictions in the information emanating from various bodies.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	Vacant social houses, which are categorised as voids, need far greater repairs than normal reletting works to bring them to a suitable letting condition. They are vacant pending that work. Strong funding support has been given to all local authorities to remediate vacant social housing so the homes involved can be let again as soon as possible. This Exchequer funding is in addition to the funding provided by local authorities to bring vacant properties back into use. The works that are carried out focus on returning vacant social homes to use as quickly as possible and on remediation work that brings long-term benefits. Insulation retrofitting, for example, means that when a house is let again, it has high levels of comfort and reduced heating costs for the incoming tenant. Almost €100 million in Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities since the introduction of the voids programme. Over 8,000 homes have been remediated since 2014. The number of vacant homes returned to productive use was 2,696 in 2015 and 2,090 in 2016. The number of vacant homes returned to productive use so far in 2017 is 1,228. In addition to vacant social homes, there is a regular turnover of short-term vacancies in the social housing stock of local authorities. A modest amount of work is needed in such cases. In general, such vacancies are addressed by local authorities from their own resources.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	According to the Minister, departmental statistics indicate that 8,517 long-term voids have been returned to use since 2014. According to the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, there were 4,202 voids in local authority housing stock in 2014, of which 1,082 were vacant pending regeneration - this includes O'Devaney Gardens - and 1,455 were in Dublin. If NOAC has said that the number of vacant properties was approximately 4,000 in 2014, how can the Minister say that 8,000 vacant houses have been remediated? In County Offaly, to take an example pertinent to our constituencies, 48 voids were recorded by NOAC in 2014, but departmental statistics suggest that 138 vacant properties were returned to use in 2017. In County Wicklow, ten voids were recorded by NOAC in 2014, but departmental statistics suggest that 97 vacant properties were returned to use in 2017. How can the Minister square this circle? The indication and implication is that huge work has been done to return 8,000 houses to use, but we know from NOAC that just 4,000 properties were void three years ago. We have to respect NOAC as the independent State organisation that has been put in place to adjudicate on such matters. This discrepancy can be added to the hazy Government statistics we have seen in recent years regarding the number of starts. When we looked at the figures emanating from other sources, those statistics were proven to have been built on sand.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	We both acknowledge that the voids programme is an important piece of work. It is much cheaper for a local authority to get an empty social housing property that has been vacant, and could be vacant for a long time, back into use than it is to build a new property. When such homes become part of the social housing stock, people can be housed in them. It is important, in the interests of smart investment of public funding, to ensure local authorities are doing their work and managing their stock efficiently. The voids programme has brought over 8,000 units, which might otherwise not be in use today, back into social housing use. The difference between the NOAC figures and what we are doing is that the money we provide as funding for the voids programme is separate from what NOAC is counting. Some of the houses NOAC counted in 2014 might have been part of the 2016 and 2017 voids programmes. There is no discrepancy between the numbers. We fund the voids programme for local authorities to bring vacant units back into use. In my initial reply, I gave the Deputy the numbers for 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017. Over 8,000 homes have been remediated since 2014. We still have a voids programme to complete under Rebuilding Ireland over the next three years. This will bring more voids back into use. As we get towards the end of Rebuilding Ireland, that number will decrease dramatically as we reach a point where most voids are back in use and local authorities are managing their stock much more efficiently.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	We all share the aspiration that there should be no voids in circulation. This scheme has received €85 million in Government funding. There appears to be double-counting. If the Minister cannot explain this sharp divergence orally, maybe he will put it in writing. The figure provided by an independent body is half the figure provided by the Department. It does not add up. We need to know. If there is doubt, the Minister should bring clarity. There is too much at stake, including a great deal of money, for this to be hanging over us. It took long enough to get to the bottom of the statistics in respect of housing starts, when ESB figures were being used. Some €85 million has been set aside for these purposes. In 2014, NOAC told us that there were 4,000 void units. The Minister has told us that 8,000 such units have been put back into use. Despite his best intentions, I am afraid the explanation he has just given me does not cut it. If it is not possible to provide an explanation of this sharp divergence orally, I ask for it to be provided in writing. An independent authority with Government jurisdiction is giving one figure and a Department is giving a figure that is twice as big. Some €85 million is at stake.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	We have put more than €100 million into the voids programme. The NOAC report counted voids at a point in time. We have given figures in respect of the voids we have funded through the local authorities to get such properties back into use. Of course that includes properties that became vacant after NOAC did its work in 2014. There is no discrepancy between the figures. We follow the money to see how it gets voids back into use. The important thing is that the voids are not being left vacant. They are being brought back into social housing use. NOAC did its work at a point in time in 2014. Since then, more houses have become vacant. We have funded local authorities to get those houses back into use.

The housing crisis and the associated problems are well known. We need to talk about solutions. How we can address these problems? What can we do on the ground to provide proper living facilities for people who are in crisis and are facing so much uncertainty in their living arrangements? I am dealing predominately with people who are on their own and need living units. I have heard it being discussed that the Government is considering the return of bedsits. There is nothing wrong with a bedsit if it is properly done. The main requirement I would have with regard to bedsits is that everyone is entitled to private bathroom and showering facilities, rather than shared facilities of the kind used many years ago. I do not want to see a return to that type of situation.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	Arising from a commitment I gave in October, my Department established a technical working group to update national policy advice on apartment developments and to identify and assess innovative solutions to our current accommodation pressures over and above conventional housing and apartment developments. The work of this group is nearing completion and will feed into the publication of new statutory guidelines for planning authorities by the end of the year. This will clarify planning policy in the build-to-rent sector, including the scope for innovative shared accommodation models where residents have their own living accommodation and bathrooms but may share larger kitchen facilities and communal recreation, meeting and working areas. Bedsits were permitted in the past, but we have now moved on to rental accommodation standards which require that residents can avail of their own toilet and washing facilities, as opposed to shared facilities. The number of bedsits has reduced significantly in recent years. I am considering how remaining units might be brought into use, while respecting modern standards. As the Deputy has pointed out, we need a broad range of housing solutions to meet the various aspects of our current housing challenges and the changing accommodation needs of people at different stages of their lives. We need to free ourselves from the mindset that everyone should live in a conventional three-bedroom house or self-contained apartment at every stage of their lives. We know that alternative models work in other cities. The work that is under way to update our guidelines is designed to provide a framework for such models to work in Ireland.

What exactly is the Government proposing to do to reduce the guidelines nationally for the size required and actually encourage people to provide such units, which will be well ventilated, easy to heat and have nice modern bathrooms? People with mobility problems should also be considered, and those progressing such developments should always try to ensure that there is a balance to cater for people with medical issues.  This has been going on for months and there have been many delays. The Minister mentioned the end of the year. The Dáil is finishing next week, presumably. Can the Minister clearly state whether the guidelines will be published for the benefit of people who wish to provide such units? We have heard a lot of talk. This is a crisis. Will the Minister say if he is announcing the guidelines next week?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	When we talk about what we are trying to do with the guidelines and standards for apartment development and new types of living we are not just talking about the immediate crisis. We are actually making sure that we can future-proof the growth of the country out to the 2040s. This ties in with the national planning framework which is being developed at the moment. It is my intention to make sure that these new standards are in place and that all the necessary assessments will have been carried out by the time the new planning framework is published. At the moment we are working towards the finalisation of the national planning framework, but we are also very close to publishing the new guidelines for apartment building. They will look at the 2015 guidelines as they currently stand and the changes that will be made, to cover things such as car parking spaces. The guidelines may also cover the size of apartments and the number of studio apartments in an overall development. Aside from those guidelines we are looking at build-to-rent guidelines, which is one of the new, innovative developments I spoke about which exist in other cities. We can have different guidelines in a build-to-rent sector because people are not buying these properties for life but are living in them for two or three years, or perhaps longer, which means that different requirements to those in operation for bought properties are possible. On the specific issue raised by the Deputy in terms of the return of bedsits, people are worried because they are associated with low standards. Both the Deputy and I would agree that people should have access to their own exclusive washing and toilet facilities, and so what we are looking at as part of the guidelines is how we can achieve that in a different way to what has been done in the past. We are also looking at what role there might be for the repair and leasing scheme in terms of social housing. We will have those details very shortly.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I appreciate the Minister's response, but why is it that when a person becomes a Minister they find it more difficult to give a straight answer? The Minister spoke about the end of the year. Is he talking about next week? People want to work. They want to provide units. A lot of operations around this country are on hold. The pause button has been pressed, because everyone is waiting to see what the Government will do. I have been asking the Minister about this matter over a long period of time on behalf of people who are coming to me to say that they are ready to go and ready to put in a planning application, but who want to know under what constraints they will have to operate. The Minister knows that when we are talking about housing we are talking about people who might come up from the countryside who get a job in Dublin. That person might be happy to live in a bedsit for a number of years until they are established and get up the rank a bit, save a bit of money and are able to provide different accommodation for themselves. It is all about using common sense. The outright ban on bedsits is wrong and it is costing us in terms of the provision of housing units which could be completed to high standards.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I believe people would be happy to live in a bedsit as long as they had exclusive access to their own washing facilities.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I agree.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	To do that will require a change in the guidelines. I accept that we have had to take a brief pause here, but we are talking about the development of our country for the next 20 years and it is important that we get these new guidelines right, so that when they come into operation people will know exactly what the standards are and what they are building to for the next five, ten and 15 years. There is a huge amount of investment happening already. We know from our interactions with the private sector that there is a huge amount of interest in what the new guidelines will be, and that a potentially significant number of applications will come in off the back of those guidelines. The guidelines will be published very shortly. My hope is to bring something to Cabinet the week after next. I understand that since I announced this in October there has been a brief period of pause. I believe that people can wait a week or two more to make sure that we can get the right guidelines out and implement them in tandem with the publication of the national planning framework.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I want to get information on the various housing support schemes, including the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and long-term leasing, to try and make sense of them for this year and next year. It would be useful to have projections into the future, because it would demonstrate whether or not this is a sustainable approach, even in the medium term.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Rebuilding Ireland sets out that some 87,000 households will have their housing needs met by local authorities, using either the Rental Accommodation Scheme, RAS, or the Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, over the period to 2021.  Exchequer funding for HAP in 2017 is €152.7 million. This will meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households at the start of the year and support well in excess of 15,000 additional households under the scheme in 2017. Funding for the HAP in 2018 will increase to €301 million, supporting an additional 17,000 households under the scheme next year. Funding for the RAS in 2017 is €134 million, supporting over 20,000 households under the scheme. Similar funding will be provided for 2018, providing for 600 new transfers and ongoing costs. The decreasing number of annual transfers from rent supplement to the RAS is indicative of the increasing number of transfers from rent supplement to the HAP.  Long-term leasing is also an important component of the suite of delivery options available to local authorities in meeting housing needs, the costs of which are met from my Department's Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, SHCEP. Exchequer funding for the SHCEP in 2017 is €84 million, supporting the ongoing costs of over 8,000 homes secured from a range of delivery mechanisms. This funding also provides for new houses coming into the scheme in 2017, of which 600 are targeted to be long term leases from private owners. An allocation of €115 million has been secured for 2018 which will support ongoing costs of the programme, together with additional social housing homes coming into the scheme next year, of which 2,000 are to be delivered under long-term leasing.  Responsibility for the operation of the rent supplement scheme rests with my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	A large amount of money has been announced for Rebuilding Ireland. We are trying to desegregate the capital from the current. Increasingly we are seeing the current amount growing, and given the amount of precarious employment, including zero-hour contracts, low-hour contracts and temporary employment, more people will qualify. The number is growing, and the housing model becomes unsustainable into the future because more and more money will be used for the current side as opposed to the capital side. It becomes an unsustainable housing model which really supports private landlords as opposed to a longer term approach. I accept that we are in the middle of a crisis and it will take time to get out of that. However, we are going to make it more difficult to get out of if the money is all spent and committed into the future, which is the way that this has been approached. With regard to the numbers, separating the RAS from the HAP is important because some people are simply moving from one to the other and so perhaps the numbers are being duplicated.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	We are spending taxpayers' money on Rebuilding Ireland, building more houses and looking after people who are homeless. There is going to be a 46% increase in spending next year from the commitments we got in the budget. That amounts to €1.9 billion. Some €1.4 billion of that will be capital spending on social house building. That will deliver approximately 5,900 social housing homes through buildings and acquisitions. That covers local authority building, housing body building, Part 5 builds, void conversions and acquisitions. It amounts to 5,900 new houses being added to the permanent social housing stock. An additional 2,000 will be long-term leased for 25 to 30 years. Again, this is permanent social housing stock. In total there will be almost 8,000 homes next year which will be social housing providing secure homes and sustainable tenancies for people.Clearly the HAP plays a big role in meeting these targets as well. There has been a lot of criticism about the HAP but there are a couple of things about it that are important to know. It gives flexibility to tenants who want that flexibility, and, from an administrative point of view, it saves costs for local authorities in terms of the new functions put in place. This means there is more money to go into other social housing supports. It also leads to better rental inspection standards because of the regulations in place for the HAP, and this is important. In the final two years of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, in 2020 and 2021, our reliance on the HAP for social housing will be less than our reliance on social house building, buying and long-term leasing.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	There is an argument that spending to save is another approach. If social or affordable housing units were built there would be a quicker saving on that side and a more sustainable approach. We should be able to rely on the figures from the Department rather than doubt them, and there continues to be a doubt about some of the figures. I will table some parliamentary questions that might explore this further. It continues to be said that there is sufficient flexibility to meet market demands. This does not bear fruit when we actually look at growing rents and the amount of money available. It is a double-edged sword because we do not want people who do not qualify for the HAP to face rent increases, which are not sustainable either. I dispute that it is flexible enough, and the reason it is not flexible enough is because of insufficient supply. There is no solution other than building on a much larger scale than has been announced. The Minister spoke about 46% more, but this is from a low base. It gives an impression rather than being the scale that is needed.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Building is happening at quite a dramatic scale. When I publish the figures for the work we have done on the social housing side for this year it will show us exceeding almost all of our targets. We also have ambitious plans for 2018. I ask the Deputy not to casually question the Department's numbers. This is important-----
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I am not casually questioning them.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	We publish our numbers regularly. We think it is important that we all work from the same data. With regard to flexibility around the HAP payments, of course there is flexibility to go to an additional 20% above what the HAP allows for in terms of market rent. In Kildare, this has happened in approximately 39% of cases, and payments have gone to 14% above what was the rent at the time. It shows that the HAP is working in terms of providing flexibility. Almost all of the indicators we have for social house building and for private house building show a very positive increase. Planning permissions have increased by almost 50%, construction commencement notices have increased by almost 30%, and we have a greater number of ESB connections, not just in Dublin but around the country.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	That is not reliable.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	Will the Minister outline his plans to ensure that no more deaths occur among homeless people and rough sleepers? Will he also outline plans to re-open locations similar to Apollo House that could ensure there are no more fatalities in any city throughout the rest of the winter?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I express my sympathy and condolences to the family of the lady who passed away in Cork yesterday. On the night of 7 November 2017, a total of 184 individuals were recorded as sleeping rough in Dublin. As I have said previously, no person should have to sleep rough on our streets or be without shelter at any time of the year. At last September's housing summit, I emphasised the need for all housing authorities to have sufficient capacity in emergency accommodation and to have appropriate facilities in place for every person sleeping rough, on any night of the week. I also instructed the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, at that time, to set about ensuring the delivery of 200 additional permanent emergency beds by Christmas, in a range of new facilities and locations across the city. A total of 50 of the 200 permanent beds are now in place, and the remaining 150 emergency beds will be brought into use over the coming days, with all being in place by mid-December.  The people who use these facilities will have access to a range of health and welfare supports, which they would not have on the streets. Facilities like this will provide the individuals involved with some stability so that housing authorities and the HSE can work with them to create a pathway to exit homelessness into independent living. As the weather becomes colder, my Department has also been working with local authorities to ensure that their cold weather initiatives are in place.  These arrangements ensure that additional temporary beds can be brought into use across a range of existing services and facilities for singles and couples who need them during periods of cold weather.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	There is a weather warning for snow throughout the country today. This morning, I walked in Le Fanu Park in Ballyfermot, as I always do, and the Brent geese were back. There were not enough of them, which is probably a sign of climate change, something we will discuss later, but clearly the cold snap is on the way. The woman to whose family the Minister has given his condolences, and I offer the same, as Members throughout the House really feel for these people who die on the streets, is the third to die in the past eight days and the eighth to die on our streets since August. I do not know how the Minister feels about this, but I feel ashamed of this country to have that knowledge. On Monday in my clinic, three middle-aged men, not together and not all at once but separately, visited me. All of them are working and each of them is about to be made homeless. They do not have a problem with drugs or drink, they are not chaotic and they did not make bad choices, but they are about to be made homeless for different reasons. One of them is being divorced and cannot afford to move into an apartment or flat at the current rate of rent available in the city, another is being put out of his home because the banks have repossessed it, and another is being made homeless because the landlord is selling the property he is renting. There are myriad reasons homelessness is on the increase and the Government is failing to deal with it. It is failing to deal with the long-term consequences and it is utterly failing to deal with the short-term hardship. Not all homeless people are chaotic or make bad choices. People are being made homeless because of housing policies.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	We have a crisis when it comes to homelessness and the Taoiseach has spoken about this on a number of occasions. Every time a person dies while rough sleeping I am notified. I am one of the first people to be notified about the circumstances of the death. It is a very difficult phone call to take; I can assure the Deputy of that. This is why I have made a commitment, and we are following through on that commitment, to make sure there will be a bed in place for any person sleeping rough. By the middle of December 200 new emergency beds will be in place so no one will be forced to sleep rough on the streets. These are not just temporary beds for Christmas. They are permanent emergency beds being put into our stock of emergency beds. On nights when we have difficulties with the weather or other reasons, such as Storm Ophelia, we put in place emergency beds. There are 50 to 60 of these available on any given night. A couple of weeks ago, we launched the cold weather initiative because we were entering the winter season. This has been in effect on a number of nights over recent weeks, and it remains in effect because of the cold snap that is coming and the prediction of snow. In the cold weather initiative, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive works with the voluntary sector and rough sleeper units to try to get people into secure accommodation for the night. We are working on these facilities and opening them up. They are very good facilities with single and double bedrooms and all of the wraparound supports that can be there, and we want to get people from rough sleeping into sheltered accommodation and then get them into more permanent solutions.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	There was a recent attempt by the Government, and particularly the Taoiseach, to try to normalise this, or politically normalise it, and say it happens everywhere so it is not a big deal. It is a big deal, and it is an even bigger deal when we have organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust and Inner City Helping Homeless and political parties urging the Government to declare a housing emergency. The Government declared an emergency to cut public sector pay and conditions but it will not declare a housing emergency. If it did, it would allow it to CPO, on big vacant buildings such as Apollo House and the hotel on the quays, and open the facilities needed when they are needed and shut them when they are not needed. It would also allow the Government to borrow off-balance-sheet to build the social housing needed. There is a complete refusal to recognise this is an emergency. It is an emergency that is the creation of economic policies and policies to do with developers and vulture funds in this country. I ask the Minister not to tell me he is throwing everything at the HAP because it does not work. Ask Celina Hogan, who was on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" yesterday. She is from Ballyfermot and has been living in a hotel. Every day she tries to get a landlord to take her and her two children through the HAP. The Government will give her up to €1,800 or €1,900 month for a HAP rental but landlords do not want to do the HAP and it is not happening. This is why homelessness is on the increase and it is not being dealt with.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Peter McVerry Trust is an excellent organisation and is one of our partner organisations, which we fund to provide services for people who are homeless. Among the new facilities we were to open before the middle of December is one in Cabra, which is run by the trust and is already open. It is a very fine facility that is going to help a number of people into sustainable long-term accommodation. Inner City Helping Homeless is also doing good work. I have been out with its teams to see exactly what it is doing. It is hoping to be part of a co-ordinated effort under the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and we will try to progress that work because the group has positive motivation. We are using compulsory orders very extensively in counties such as Louth and at the housing summit in January CPO powers will be a particular focus. We are not relying on putting everything on HAP and the numbers do not bear that claim out. We are building social housing through local authorities and housing bodies and we are acquiring more homes for the social housing stock, as well as long-term leasing homes. Responsibility for social housing was outsourced by previous Governments and we are taking responsibility back in a very rapid way under Rebuilding Ireland. We are also looking beyond 2021 to see if we can make it a permanent measure.

At the rough end of that are the people described in Deputy Smith's question but there are also issues related to construction and supply.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	My Department does not record monthly statistics on the number of households qualified for social housing support. Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each housing authority area are provided in the statutory summary of social housing assessments, which are now being carried out an annual basis and we have last year's figures. The most recently published statutory summary of social housing assessments relates to the assessment carried out in 2016. This records the number of households on all local authority waiting lists, as of 21 September 2016.  The results of the 2016 summary show that there were 91,600 households deemed qualified for, and in need of, social housing support. Full details in relation to the 2016 assessment are available on my Department's website. I expect the results of the 2017 assessment, carried out in September, to be published shortly. We expect the figures to be slightly down but we do not have them yet and there is no point giving the Deputy figures that are not fully assessed. When we have them we will make them available. If we need to correct the record we will do so, but we work off the net need at the moment.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I appreciate that the figures will be out in a few weeks' time but while the Minister has indicated they will be lower, I imagine they will not be much lower. We are all aware of the huge demand for housing and the number on waiting lists around the country. This goes back to Deputy Cowen's question about supply and the construction programme of local authorities. We really need local authorities to build houses for people on waiting lists, which is the most basic and traditional way to supply housing. I did some analysis of the social housing output report of 2015 on schemes that were approved by the beginning of 2016 and the recent social housing construction status report of 2017 indicates that the majority of those approved at that time are still not at construction stage but are in the capital appraisal, preplanning and pre-tender stages. They have not started building yet. What is the Minister doing to get the construction programme moving more quickly? Is the problem in the Department, in councils or somewhere between the two?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	We have had discussions on the various processes of getting on site which we are constantly trying to improve as a major part of Rebuilding Ireland. Local authorities are the responsible authorities to do this. Their capacity was reduced by previous Governments, for reasons with which I did not agree, but we are building it up by strengthening their teams and the number of people available to them, as well as giving them funding so that they can up their game and take charge of the delivery of housing. The most recent statistics show that there are 772 developments in the pipeline, which will deliver 12,293 homes, though we have asked local authorities to increase this figure. The number of schemes at capital appraisal is 165, with 119 at preplanning and 58 at pre-tender design. The number of site starts is 191 and at site finish stage there are 147. On top of these there are acquisitions and bringing back voids and turnkey projects so activity is well up. The figures will show that next year, with up to 8,000 social houses being delivered as compared to a year ago or two or three years ago. We recognise that it is not enough and we have told local authorities to put more projects in place. This includes agreeing a new timeline for bringing projects to site and where it used to be up to five years it is now at 59 weeks, which is in line with the private sector.

In my local authority, houses which are going to be ready for occupation next year will be counted as delivered in 2018 but they started back in 2014. There are sites on which construction should have started years ago but they are still sites and, meanwhile, people are out on the streets, hungry and cold and trying to get into emergency accommodation. We need a sense of urgency.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	That is exactly what we are trying to put into the system. I agree that there is no excuse for sites taking up to eight years to be completed. We are reviewing all the projects and we are looking at the processes to see if we can put in place realistic timelines that all local authorities can sign up to. Their housing teams and chief executives have bought into this, as has our Department. Our job is to deliver it and a new team in the Department will track it on a weekly basis, viewing sites with me and the Minister to ensure it is happening on the ground and to deal with any barriers we come across. In the past there were no timelines or agreed process, which is a crazy way to deliver projects, but we now have these things and with proper project management I am confident we can deliver them on time. It is not good enough for a project to take six years. It happened in the past but it will not happen in the future and we will stand over that. We had to narrow the process down first and we have achieved that.

The Department uses a different methodology for the housing needs assessment it is about to publish, as it did last year, so it is important to outline the methodology to the House. The Department is not cleaning the statistics in the same way as it did and, having spoken to council officials, I am unclear as to what the methodology is in my council area and how comparable are last year's and this year's figures.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	It will be based on net need, which means people who are in need of a house or whose housing needs are not being met. People on the HAP or RAS schemes or on the transfer list are not included because their housing needs are met but it will include people on rent assistance, which is 45% of the total number on the housing waiting list. It also includes people in other private rented accommodation, or in emergency accommodation. It includes anyone who is in need of a social house and qualifies under income limits. We do not expect a dramatic drop in the figures but we have analysed the data and we expect a slight reduction. This is not enough for people who want a house but it is a positive trend. The more important trend, however, is that for the delivery of housing which is up as compared to recent years, and rightly so, both for completed houses and starts. We are asking local authorities and all parties to help us in this as we need support at local authority level. There are still far too many vacant properties. We have recommended all the schemes to deal with vacant properties, such as CPO, repair and leaseback and the purchase and renew scheme because they are not being fully utilised at present. It is even worse that somebody is homeless in a county where there are vacant properties.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	The Minister will recall that I have raised the issue of the need to increase the income eligibility limits for social housing with him on several occasions, as well as with his predecessor, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, and with the Minister of State, Deputy English. My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is in the lowest income limit band and the limit is far too low. I have previously cited in the House cases of people on family income supplement who have been denied the opportunity to apply for a council house because the family income supplement brings them above the income threshold. That they have been approved for family income supplement demonstrates that their income is not sustainable to support a family but they are unable to qualify for social housing. That situation urgently needs to be addressed.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The social housing assessment regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority in different bands according to area, with income defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy. The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. The limits also reflect a blanket increase of €5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities, which also had a future-proofing impact. Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve that by providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying the households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of the income eligibility limits for social housing supports has commenced. I expect the results of the review to be available for publication in the first half of 2018.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I thank the Minister for his reply and I welcome that the review is under way. However, delivery in the first half of 2018 could be seven months away, which would not be acceptable. I was given a commitment by the Minister's predecessor that the study would be concluded at an early date and the Minister gave a similar indication in response to previous parliamentary questions. Each time the issue has been raised, the schedule for publication has been put back. I appeal to the Minister to demand of his officials that they complete the review within a month or six weeks. As I said to the Minister on the last occasion I raised this issue during Oral Questions, a long, drawn-out review is not needed. The Department should ring a few good officials in councils who are dealing with the issue on a daily basis. Such officials could give the Department examples of applicants who have been turned down because of the family income supplement or carer's allowance payment being factored into their income. This exercise should be completed very quickly. There is an urgent need to increase income limits. One of the great successes of social housing in this country has been the mix of people in communities in large local authority housing areas. We will lose that mix of people in my area because those working in low-paid jobs are not eligible for consideration for social housing. That needs to be rectified in the very early part of 2018, not in a year's time.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I share the Deputy's concern and his desire to get the report completed as quickly as possible. When I said it would be delivered in the first half of 2018, I did not mean that it would be done in seven months' time. We want it to be done as quickly as possible. We have been engaging with the Housing Agency, which is doing this work, to get the report done as quickly as possible. I understand the Deputy's point on getting in touch with local authorities that might be better than others in order to get a quicker understanding of what might need to be done in this area but in order to do a review such as this and given its importance and how it will affect every local authority in the State it has to be comprehensive, consistent and work with each local authority to get the relevant data and make an assessment on that basis. I agree with the Deputy's commitment to ensuring we maintain a mix in communities and the social housing stock. One of the reasons an additional €5,000 was built into the 2011 review was to ensure we were bringing in a broader cohort, facilitating a mix and keeping sustainable communities. The limits are net of things such as tax and USC and, therefore, in some areas are above the average industrial wage, although I appreciate Cavan is in the lowest band. Work is being done by the Housing Agency and as soon as it is completed, we will publish it.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I again appeal to the Minister to go back to the Housing Agency and the senior officials in his Department and ask them to give this issue the utmost urgency. We cannot condemn people who are working in low-paid jobs and trying to care for and support their families in difficult circumstances to renting houses for the rest of their lives. Such people come to my clinics every week and ask me if there is any chance they will get on the council housing list. A difficulty for such people is that they are renting and are unable to draw down the other supports available to those on the council housing list. It is not the only difficulty but it is an extra factor. They realise they do not have a chance of being able to get a mortgage or source funding from a financial institution in order to provide a home for themselves. They need to be able to access local authority housing. We must help the people who are working hard and trying to provide for their families. Most of the people who have come to me are young mothers and lone parents working in low-paid jobs and trying to rear families on their own in exceptionally difficult circumstances. They need to be supported by the State.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I understand and respect the Deputy's commitment to the issue and to his constituents who are in this very difficult situation. It is difficult to know what assessments are being done in individual cases. I do not yet know what the review will conclude and it is not clear to me if it will recommend an increase in the bands or, if such increase is recommended, how much that might be. We are moving to introduce an affordability scheme to deal with the issue, as was addressed in a previous question this morning. It is important that we can look after people. We must move away from a person either qualifying for social housing supports and getting almost all the supports the State can offer, or not qualifying and getting almost nothing. There is a cohort of people who need our support and for whom a little help will make a large difference. That is why we are bringing back an affordability scheme, the details of which I will announce as soon as I can.

That is already the case in respect of carer's allowance. In my constituency, a working family were €500 a year over the social housing income threshold and were consequently denied access to social housing support and have to pay €1,600 per month in rent. Separate to the review, the Minister could change the regulations overnight to allow for the disregard of family income supplement. I urge him to do so because it would solve the problem for many of our constituents.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	As announced in budget 2018, my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, intends to establish Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to provide funding on market terms to viable residential development projects whose owners are experiencing difficulty in obtaining debt funding. Officials from my Department have met with Department of Finance officials on the matter and will continue to engage with them as the enabling legislation is developed. I understand that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will bring forward the relevant legislation to the Oireachtas in early 2018, with a view to commencing operations later next year. With a proposed allocation of up to €750 million, it is estimated that HBFI could have capacity to fund the construction of around 6,000 new homes in the coming years. I welcome the addition of this new instrument that will further support the delivery of projects to supply much-needed new homes. The measure will bolster the strong supply-side measures introduced to date under Rebuilding Ireland which are beginning to have a positive impact.  In its role as a commercial lender, HBFI will not have any remit in designing the housing mix contained in the schemes which it funds. However, developments funded by HBFI will be subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments, including the delivery of social housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	Although finance for builders is a good idea, is it correct that approximately 8% is being proposed? Will NAMA have any involvement? As Members know, none of the houses in which NAMA has had an involvement will be sold at an affordable price. It is considering a minimum of approximately €350,000, which is not an affordable price for most people in Ireland who need a house and cannot get one.I am 100% in favour of the State facilitating small developers to build by organising finance for them because, as we know, many of them are struggling to obtain finance. Large developers can build, but the State has the option of cutting them out and working with small developers by financing them. This could have a huge impact on the supply of housing. Housing must be provided at an affordable price. Given that the State can borrow money at less than 1%, surely a rate of 8% is draconian.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	I agree with the Deputy that builders in many parts of the country are experiencing difficulties in obtaining finance at an affordable rate to allow them to undertake projects that are viable and can deliver houses at prices people can afford. We have introduced a number of measures to help with construction and development costs in site development. For example, the An Bord Pleanála process has been fast-tracked and the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, has been put in place, which essentially is the Government paying the development levies. We have also introduced the help-to-buy scheme and are now introducing Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, which will be a new source of finance for builders who cannot get it from the traditional lenders. I cannot comment on what the exact rate will be, but it will be provided for in the legislation when the Minister brings it forward. However, I do know that it will be competitive and commercially viable. On HBFI interactions with NAMA, my understanding is it will sit alongside NAMA and that there will be a service level agreement under which staff will be seconded to work in the new entity which will work to provide finance for builders and developers throughout the country to have more homes built more quickly at more affordable prices.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	There is potential for Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to be a positive development. I do not, however, see any rationale for NAMA's involvement in HBFI other than in relation to how money might be provided off the books. On several occasions in this House I have heard Members speak about availing of the expertise available in NAMA on housing. It is well known that it does not have that expertise. It simply engages large developers, with which it has found favour, to provide that expertise. To say it has expertise on housing is a little like saying former Anglo Irish Bank employees had expertise in the supply of housing during the boom times, which was not the reality. The Government has no scheme or structure in place to tackle the lack of affordable housing coming onto the market in Ireland. The previous scheme which was far from perfect was done away with in 2011. We now need a different type of scheme. Currently, the State is making no effort to supply affordable housing.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	As the Deputy will be aware, traditionally large developers would have had access to finance; therefore, I would not expect them to approach HBFI for it. Home Building Finance Ireland is a new entity that will provide finance for small builders and developers throughout the country at competitive commercial rates of interest to enable them to build more homes at affordable prices. We have a different view on NAMA and the expertise available therein. There is a body expertise available within it that has been working in the State's interests for the past few years. As NAMA winds down and comes to the end of its life cycle, there is potential for this State resource to be put to very important use - having more homes built more quickly and at more affordable prices. On the Deputy's comment that the State is doing nothing to provide affordable housing, apart from the affordability scheme which I will announce, we have put in place a number of measures, including the €200 million provided for the LIHAF to open up new sites more quickly, which will result in the provision of housing at more affordable prices. A second round of LIHAF funding was announced in budget 2018.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	The LIHAF is not helping.

Some 10,000 units have gone through the pre-consultation and the An Bord Pleanála fast-track process. All of these measures have been put in place to try to remove some of the last impediments to building more homes more quickly and at more affordable prices. They will start to come on stream towards the end of this year and in 2018.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	It is approximately two and a half years since I made a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children, Mr. Niall Muldoon, about the conditions in which children were living in hotel rooms, guesthouses and emergency accommodation. I have also asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, what work is being done to address the longer term physical and mental health impacts of homelessness on children. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, told me yesterday that there were still 676 families and approximately 3,000 children in this type of accommodation. The Government and everyone who has served as Minister with responsibility for housing will be held to account for this in years to come, be it by way of tribunals or multi-party actions and so on. What is the Minister doing on a weekly basis to help the families mentioned? 
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I thank the Deputy for this question. One of the key commitments made in Rebuilding Ireland is that we will support homeless families and children to exit homelessness into independent tenancies. For homeless families residing in emergency accommodation, the long-term solution is to increase and accelerate the supply of homes. Rebuilding Ireland seeks to achieve this and in the period to 2021 some 50,000 social housing homes will be delivered. On child homelessness, a key objective is to cease using commercial hotels to accommodate homeless families, except in limited circumstances. I am committed to achieving this objective and continue to work with a range of partners to get to a point where families presenting to a housing authority as homeless will not have to rely on hotel accommodation. Regarding the activities my Department and I are undertaking to address child homelessness, we are working with local authorities to accelerate the delivery of social housing for those who need it and while these more permanent housing solutions are being put in place, we are working with local authorities to deliver family hubs which are a first response only but do provide more suitable, safe and supported family living arrangements. Twelve hubs, providing 300 units of family accommodation, are operational and seven more, to accommodate more than 160 families, will be operational by the end of the year. More will follow in 2018. On the provision of supports for homeless families in emergency accommodation, I liaise on a regular basis with my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to ensure robust child protection measures, inspection arrangements and health supports are in place in emergency accommodation for families. I have also met the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioner to discuss issues in connection with homeless families. I will continue to work with all stakeholders on a sustained basis with a view to addressing family and child homelessness.

This is the second Christmas, or perhaps the third, many children will spend in a single room in a hotel or guesthouse. We have all heard heartbreaking stories from young mothers and couples about the impact this is having on children. Has the Minister visited any of the families involved and asked anybody in the Department to undertake an analysis of the physical and mental impact on families, particularly children, of living in this type of accommodation? The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, co-funded a study of food access and nutritional health among families living in emergency homeless accommodation which she has told me does not make for pleasant reading. This is an ongoing outrageous scandal. Unfortunately, not enough people in the country appear to be taking it with the seriousness with which it will be taken when what has happened in the period from 2010 is invigilated. As I said, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will be among those who will be held to account.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	I have visited a number of the family hubs where I met a number of families who were previously in hotel accommodation. Yesterday Focus Ireland launched two very important reports on the experiences of homeless families and families that had exited homelessness into family hubs and the impact it had had on them. I accept that the target of mid-July in taking families out of hotels was not met, but there had been an exceptional increase in the number of families presenting as homeless in the month previous. The hub model which is only a first response was criticised by many for many months. Some of the people who criticised it have now visited the hubs and met and heard from families on how much improved their situation is. There is now recognition that family hubs are the best first response in that we can provide wrap-around supports for families while working to move them towards permanent housing solutions. The evidence to date is that families are spending far less time in family hubs before moving to permanent accommodation than was the case when they were in hotels.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	Everything is happening too slowly. The Taoiseach and the Minister recently laid the foundation stone for 84 homes at Clongriffin in the Dublin Bay North constituency where there are almost 7,000 families on the housing waiting list.It is just far too slow. We still need to talk in terms of a housing emergency, and perhaps we need to talk about a housing executive for Dublin. The Minister has been talking about his affordable housing scheme for months. Where is it? Why does he not just bring it forward and start treating this as it should be treated, that is, as a complete emergency? Finally, the Minister will have noted Dr. Rory Hearne's and Dr. Mary Murphy's study on hubs and their warning that they should not be used as family accommodation for more than three months. I wish to raise with the Minister very briefly the Department's own guidelines, Policy and Procedural Guidance for Housing Authorities in relation to Assisting Victims of Domestic Violence with Emergency and Long-term Accommodation Needs. We are coming to the end of the 16-day campaign to combat violence against women. A brilliant organisation in my constituency, Sonas, as well as Aoibhneas, have drawn my attention to the difficulties families coming out of refuge accommodation face in accessing accommodation because of the inflexibility of the local authorities' response to this. There are a number of gaps in the Department's guidelines that I would like the Minister to urgently address as well.

Social housing homes are being built. We are rapidly increasing the number of social housing homes being built by local authorities and housing bodies over what was built last year and the year before last. This is welcome progress and we will increase that number again next year. Importantly, we are seeing homes being built on the private side as well. The increase in the housing stock across the country generally will help us to deal with issues faced not only by people who need social housing homes-----

We are putting in every care and support we can into families in hubs, looking after the children. These families' experiences were one of the very first things brought to my attention on my appointment as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, perhaps on the first or second day in the job. I have met with care workers working in hubs, and they are concerned about the long-term impacts on these children as they move into adulthood. That is why I am working with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, to ensure that every support possible is in place and why we are trying to get families out of hubs as quickly as possible. The evidence to date shows that the vast majority of families are spending less than six months in hubs-----

I would like to know the correlation between the increase in student accommodation and how it is affecting or addressing the homelessness situation and housing lists, particularly in Dublin.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	113	Increased availability of dedicated student accommodation can relieve pressure arising in the wider rental sector from students looking to meet their accommodation needs. By extension, this increases the overall housing stock, which in turn assists in addressing wider housing supply issues, providing capacity for other accommodation to be made available to provide solutions for others seeking housing, including households at risk of becoming homeless. To support and drive increased student accommodation delivery, my Department has implemented several measures under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, including fast-tracking planning applications directly to An Bord Pleanála for student accommodation projects of 200 or more bed spaces, and facilitating low-cost funding availability from the Housing Finance Agency to the higher education institutes specifically for student accommodation projects. Applications for more than 3,000 units are before An Bord Pleanála at present. Furthermore, in fulfilment of Action 4.7 of Rebuilding Ireland, the national student accommodation strategy was developed and launched in July by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and me, in close consultation with my Department, with key targets and actions to support the student accommodation sector. The combination of these measures will allow for the freeing up of dwellings in the general rental market as students are facilitated to move towards purpose-built student accommodation units, giving other households in the rental sector a better chance to access rental accommodation. To give Deputy O'Sullivan an idea of the figures, since we launched Rebuilding Ireland in 2016, an additional 2,606 purpose-built student beds have become available to the market; a little over 4,000 are under construction today; planning was lodged for over 4,500 recently; and going through the planning process at present, including some in respect of which planning has been granted, are over 4,500. We are greatly increasing capacity in purpose-built student accommodation, and rightly so. I know there are difficulties of over-concentration in some areas, but some of our actions in the action plan are dealing with that, trying to blend in student accommodation with communities. We are working hard on that too because we want to increase direct build of student accommodation, but in a sustainable way for communities.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	We have had this discussion before, and I understand the point the Minister of State made then and makes now that this is an important and a distinct category and that under-provision of student accommodation has meant demands on the private rented sector. However, the point I made then and which I make again now is that we have this urgency and this efficiency in getting student accommodation built - I will leave the other issues for the moment - but a student population is transient. Students are in situ for perhaps seven, possibly eight, months of the year, so there are another four months during which this student accommodation will be available for Airbnb or whatever else. This is a major profit-making opportunity for the builder, for the developer. One of the biggest housing issues I am seeing is the difficulty single men face. When I look at the increase in student accommodation, I do not see it bringing down the housing list. Yet we want the social mix. Why was there no discussion with those who provide student accommodation on the possibility of having some for single people? They could go through the Garda vetting and references and everything else, but then they would have the accommodation for 12 months, or permanently. This, rather than student accommodation, would make a difference to the housing lists.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	We are trying to tackle the housing shortage in many different ways, of which purpose-built student accommodation is a very successful one. The demands of students are slightly different from those of families, who need accommodation all year round. We have had some success in this regard. Purpose-built student accommodation will free up other properties in the rental sector. The planning guidelines were changed and clarified in respect of the use of such accommodation for the three or four months during which it is not in use by students in order to make these projects viable. This is why we see increased delivery of student accommodation. It is more viable to do this now. However, there are also very strict conditions as to what these properties can be used for those three or four months of the year. In the majority of cases they are used by international students coming to avail of facilities over the summer months. In fairness, I think much of the new student accommodation is blending in very well with the communities, and rightly so. This will free up properties. We are achieving what the Deputy wants to achieve. The effect is that the housing lists are coming down. We will see this year's figures in a few weeks' time, and I expect they will show this. However, that is not enough. We must keep going, and part of that is an increased supply of direct-build student accommodation. To be clear, it is not just private developers; there is a greater increase now in the higher education institutes delivering their own plans and proposals. Before An Bord Pleanála today are applications for more than 3,500 units directly by the education players themselves.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	We discussed before the difficulties that a preponderance of student accommodation brings into an area and a community and the need to address that. On-campus accommodation is excellent because there are ways for the community to engage; with the private sector there is not. This is why the suggestion had been made of some kind of regulator of student accommodation, perhaps combining it with hostel accommodation. The Minister of State still has not answered my question on the fact that student accommodation is vacant for at least four months of the year in most cases, whereas if some of these student accommodation units had been given to the housing list, particularly for single men and single women, I think that would have worked and would have made a big difference to housing lists. It is a question of that period of four months and what will happen to that accommodation. It could be left idle, but I doubt it because there is too big of a profit-making opportunity there.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	Again, the business case for all these purpose-built student accommodation units allows for their usage over that number of months. It is a period of three or four months. It is actually more in some cases because one must take into account the Christmas period as well. Such accommodation is used by other students coming into the country from the higher education sector and other people who avail of our education facilities. Yes, in some cases Airbnb is used, but that is what they are there for. This is monitored through the planning system and controlled. The developers make applications through An Bord Pleanála and the local authorities and they must detail their full plans for those premises. It is not the same as providing housing for other families or for single people. This is specifically student accommodation, not permanent homes. Students' needs are a little different from everyone else's needs. The Deputy says we should build more homes for others. We are doing that as well. This is one section, one category. We are trying to approach this in many different ways and, again, the figures will show this is freeing up rental properties that are more suitable for others. There is no doubt about that. Naturally, given the changes made recently in the budget by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, we are trying to direct investment to other areas of residential accommodation and make that more affordable and more attractive. Many of the issues the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, deals with seek to encourage investment into other forms of accommodation for single men and other people who need that as well. There is activity there too, but this is specifically about student accommodation. It is a key area we have identified and we must provide more student accommodation.First, they want it, but we also want to have it to free up other properties. On the issues around the communities, in most cases, in any of the new accommodation that is being built, there are good reports about student interaction with the communities. They have been asked to do it and that interaction with communities is being addressed in any of the planning applications.

They are not eligible for social housing and they are unable to afford to buy a house. While they have good jobs and a household income of €40,000 to €70,000, they are still struggling to put together the money to buy a house because they are paying €1,300 for rent, child care and so on. They want to buy their own home. They have seen all the different plans but they need to see bricks and mortar. They need houses that are affordable to buy or to rent.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by households, particularly those on low to moderate incomes, in parts of the country where housing costs and demand are highest. A number of measures have already been introduced to maximise and expedite housing supply and improve affordability. The latest housing activity reports indicate that the range of measures being taken are beginning to yield positive impacts in terms of increasing planning permissions, on-site commencement activity and more new homes being connected to the electricity grid. In addition, under budget 2018 the Government has removed further significant obstacles to building more homes, more quickly and at more affordable prices by investing more in direct house-building by the State, providing additional funding for servicing housing land, removing the capital gains tax incentive to hold onto residential land, leveraging LIHAF investment in enabling infrastructure to provide a proportion of homes from these sites at reduced prices, escalating penalties for land hoarding and providing a new, more affordable finance vehicle for house builders through Home Building Finance Ireland. Furthermore, under budget 2018 I have also secured funding of €25 million over 2018 and 2019 to unlock local authority-owned lands specifically for affordable housing, using delivery models like co-operative housing, which have already proven to be successful but are now needed at a much greater scale. My Department is currently finalising the arrangements for the use of this funding and I expect to announce details in this regard shortly.

I have a number of questions. What does the Minister consider to be an affordable house? What is an affordable rent? The Central Bank has a limit of 3.5 times income. What figures has the Minister been able to put together on that? Has he assessed the impact of the help-to-buy scheme on the price of houses? Has he looked at developing any new or similar initiative to support house buyers in the next year? The Minister talked about the possibility of local authority houses being put back on the affordable scheme. It was a very bad move to get rid of that scheme in 2012 and it has left a big gap in the meantime. Local authorities are already out there with plans for social houses. Are they now going to have to start back at the very start with plans for affordable houses on greenfield sites? If they are, those houses will not realistically have gone through the planning system and will not be available for at least a year and a half. Has the Minister considered going through the local authorities in regard to the opportunities for one-off rural houses where people have a site available, so they can get planning permission and get on with building their own home?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	Obviously, when we talk about affordability and what is affordable to an individual, it depends on their means. The Central Bank has income limits in place when it comes to taking out a mortgage. When we talk about affordability, we look at two aspects. We look at what is affordable for the developer or builder to be able to build a house that can then be sold at an affordable price, and we have brought in measures to help with that. Home Building Finance Ireland is one measure that is on the way, and there is LIHAF 1, the newly announced LIHAF 2 and other measures to help builders to build at more affordable prices. The fast-track An Bord Pleanála planning process is another measure in this regard. The new affordability scheme that will be announced shortly will be looking again at income limits to help those people who are not accessible or eligible for social housing but who cannot afford to put together a mortgage for houses in high demand areas. We will be looking at income limits above the eligibility for social housing in order to bring that to a range of probably between €45,000 and €70,000 or €75,000. That will be finalised when we announce the criteria for access to the affordability scheme. Of course, we have a number of models already under way in terms of affordability. There is the Ó Cualann model of co-operative housing which was delivering a two-bedroom house for €140,000 and a three-bedroom house for €170,000. We want to do that now at scale, which is what the €25 million fund is for. With regard to rent pressure zones, to date, the data shows us that rent is increasing by less than 4% in those zones, compared to over 8.5% last year. We will have quarter three data on rent pressure zones next week, I hope, and that will tell us if the trend is continuing. If it is, that is welcome. Every quarter new areas come under those zones, which means rents at an affordable price. To conclude, within the LIHAF funding there are rent affordability measures on some of those sites, in particular in Cork and also on a site in Dublin, which will allow for rents at an affordable price.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	On behalf of those on this side of the House, I would like to wish the serving member of An Garda Síochána who was injured in the line of duty last night a very speedy recovery and good health. I wish to raise with the Tánaiste an issue of job creation and inward investment. It is an issue we have raised previously in the House and it has been discussed at the Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Committee of Public Accounts. The Tánaiste will be aware the Succeed in Ireland initiative was a concept which flowed from the Global Economic Forum, the think tank that developed after the economic crash. The concept was to connect with and harness the Irish diaspora right around the world, with a view to creating inward investment and job creation in Ireland. One thing that flowed from that was a contract which was being managed by the IDA and contracted out to a contractor known as ConnectIreland. Interestingly, as the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, and the former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will know, the cost of every job created under this scheme was in region of €4,000 whereas the cost of an IDA job is in the region of €10,000. That contract ran out in 2017. Prior to that, there was notification of a tender process which was then rowed back on. Since March 2017, which is almost eight and a half months ago, we have been promised a review of that initiative. It is important to note that the Succeed in Ireland initiative brought into this country 95 new-name start-up enterprises, equating to in excess of 2,500 jobs. To be fair, the IDA will dispute the level of jobs but there is a verification process in regard to that. Last week, in the absence of a Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and while the Taoiseach was acting in that capacity, ConnectIreland, which was the contractor and which is in dispute in this regard, wrote to the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and pointed out a number of issues in regard to it. The correspondence states:In the course of our attempts to vindicate those diaspora, we have uncovered the most egregious, systematic and deliberate misconduct by the IDA in pursuit of its own self-interest, conduct that has laid waste to potentially thousands of new jobs and billions of euro of investment in Ireland. Despite our efforts to have these issues addressed, nothing has been done. We are constantly deflected by the mantra that our issues are nothing but a contractual dispute over the number of jobs created in the initiative. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we have been trying to expose misconduct which is of public and national importance and goes far beyond our disagreements over job numbers. However, our efforts have been met with a campaign of misinformation, concealment and attempts to silence us, our stakeholders and the diaspora through interferences in the democratic process.What we have is a disagreement, on the one hand, but, on the other, we have the Succeed in Ireland initiative which has huge merit in terms of linking with our diaspora from around the country, and which has delivered jobs and investment to this country. Does the Tánaiste agree the Succeed in Ireland initiative has delivered jobs and investment into Ireland, which is of benefit, and that it has done so in a value for money fashion? Does he agree the Succeed in Ireland initiative should continue in some shape or form to deliver and to work in compliment with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland?Last March, almost eight months ago, we were promised a review. When will it be completed and when can we expect to receive it? We have raised the issue a number of times. Will the Tánaiste note from the correspondence the Taoiseach has been given that the connectors are seeking a formal public investigation into why we have reached this juncture?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	I thank the Deputy for raising these issues. He will appreciate that I will not be able to give detailed answers to all of his questions, but I will ensure the line Minister will contact him about them. I am familiar with the Succeed in Ireland initiative and have been involved in a number of promotional events with ConnectIreland at different times. Undoubtedly, ConnectIreland has reached out to the diaspora and others in an effort to bring jobs to Ireland at a time when they are badly needed. It was an example of new thinking in putting in place new structures and new ways of reaching out to the diaspora, something the Government supports, but any initiative that uses public funding needs to be reviewed and tested to ensure we are getting full value for money and that it is working in a complementary manner with the other arms of the State that are doing similar work. My understanding is this is the process ConnectIreland has had to go through. I will ask the Minister to update the Deputy on the review to which he referred. The Government constantly assesses ways of reaching out in a more effective manner to the diaspora generally but with a particular view towards returning investment to Ireland. The record of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in recent years is strong. There has been a strong pipeline of increased investment in Ireland in the past two or three years, not just in Dublin but also across the country. Any organisation or initiative needs to be open to independent and robust scrutiny to ensure it is the best model for achieving what we are trying to achieve. ConnectIreland cannot be an exception. If some of the issues the Deputy raised are of real concern, we will try to get answers for him. If there is a dispute between ConnectIreland and other State organisations, we must ensure there will be an independent assessment to establish the facts.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I am not advocating on behalf of ConnectIreland which is happy to take its chances in competing in an open tender process to manage the scheme; rather, I am saying the Succeed in Ireland initiative was a success. The Tánaiste and I agree that the initiative taps into the diaspora in creating inward investment and jobs. Unfortunately, for the past eight and a half months there has been nothing but drift. The scheme was brought to an end prematurely having previously been extended. There was no reason not to extend the scheme in parallel with the review. Unfortunately, we have not seen the terms of reference for the review or the establishment of a review panel. When we raised this matter at a committee meeting yesterday, we received a dead man's answer. Granted, the new Minister has only been in office for a number of days, but the point must be impressed on the Government which must acknowledge its seriousness. There is a significant resource of people around the world who want to create jobs and invest in Ireland. We are not taking this as an opportunity to bash IDA Ireland. Like the Tánaiste, we acknowledge that it has played a considerable and successful role, but it is not above questioning either.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	I will raise the issue with the new Minister in the Department, but it is important to point out that ConnectIreland's original business model did not provide a viable return for the operator and subsequently needed to be altered. A contracting arrangement was put in place and financial support provided. We need to assess what happened with the business model, whether it was returning what was expected of it under the contractual arrangements in place and whether it is the best way of spending public money to get the return the Deputy and I both want, namely, more Irish people coming home and bringing jobs and ideas with them. There is no dispute on that issue. The only issue concerns the need for a robust, independent assessment of the story of ConnectIreland and the Succeed in Ireland initiative and to learn lessons from it. If the initiative has a role to play in the future, I would be comfortable with it. If it does not, so be it. We must ensure there are other ways to do what we wanted to do with the initiative, but that question should be the subject of the independent assessment that is under way.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	The European Council at its meeting scheduled for next Thursday will decide whether sufficient progress has been achieved in the Brexit talks to allow movement to the next phase. I hope the Tánaiste and I agree that this cannot and will not happen unless the matters of concern to Ireland, North and South, are addressed and solutions agreed that defend the national interest. I hope we agree that any agreement must ensure the North will remain within the customs union and the Single Market and that the legal and political infrastructure of the Good Friday Agreement will be hardwired into any deal. It also means that we must have certainty on the issues of citizens' rights and access to the European Court of Justice and other European institutions for citizens living in the North. Anything short of this will guarantee a Brexit border between the North and the South and the ensuing economic and political chaos. According to the Taoiseach on Monday, there was an agreement between the British Government and the European Union but the DUP then pulled the rug from under the Tories' feet and it all collapsed. In the midst of this, there was a great deal of talk about but little meaning in there being no regulatory divergence and continued regulatory alignment. Despite this lack of clarity and not having seen the text, we gave the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach our qualified support on the basis that they would seek and achieve an agreement that would defend the national interest in the way I have outlined. When the agreement collapsed, the Taoiseach stated he would not accept anything other than the deal he believed he had had on Monday. He was holding firm. Today, however, we hear new and worrying language from the Government. We hear that it will consider any new text from the Tory Government in London. We also hear about a fudge on the Government's much vaunted regulatory alignment. The British Prime Minister continues to play a game of make-believe that the North can be forced out of the customs union and the Single Market and that a hard border can be avoided. The Irish Government cannot be sucked into this delusion. If the Tories want to sail off into the sunset from the European Union, that is their business, but what happens in the North of Ireland is our business and that of the Government. The Government has a strong hand to play and democracy firmly on its side, given that the people of the North have not consented to leaving the Single Market or the customs union. They voted to remain and it falls to the Government to defend that vote. It should be sure we will stand shoulder to shoulder with it, if it does so. As it cannot afford a fudge, it needs to make the right call. As the Tánaiste stated, there is no room for creative ambiguity. Will he state clearly and with certainty that the Government will not agree to any deal that would drag the North from the customs union and the Single Market?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	The Government has acted in a way that has been consistent for months and we do not intend to move away from that position. We regard the responsibility of the Government in the Brexit negotiations as being hugely important in the context of the national interest on the island of Ireland as a whole. That is why we have tried to listen to all views from political parties in government and opposition and from all of the political parties in Northern Ireland on the genuine concerns people have.It is as a result of this that we have negotiated for some time, through very clear structures and an EU task force led by Michel Barnier, with our counterparts in the UK who are negotiating on behalf of the British Government. At the start of the week, we had agreement on a text which was subsequently not confirmed. We are now in a position whereby we need to find a way forward. Let me be clear. The core issues on which Ireland got agreement at the start of the week are not changing and, as I said, are in the interests of the island and the relationships on it North and South, east and west and between different communities and political parties. We have maintained and will continue to maintain that position. The Taoiseach has said that we will of course consider any other proposals which the British Government may offer. Our position on the core meaning of the text on which we had agreement on Monday needs to remain intact. If other proposals need consideration we will give them consideration. The position of the Government on some of the key issues raised again today, including protecting the Good Friday Agreement, recognising and retracting the principle of consent, ensuring that we maintain the integrity of the EU Single Market and maintaining North-South co-operation on an all island economy basis ensures that regardless of how the negotiations go, if and when we move to phase 2 we can reassure people that there will not be a re-emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland. It will also mean that we will protect citizens' rights in Northern Ireland, the common travel area, which people take for granted in the context of Brexit, and peace funding commitments which have been made. Many issues are subject to negotiation. We accept the British Government is trying to move this process forward in good faith. We want to work with it rather than against it on that, but Ireland has real concerns which are important to the country and its future, and to the island and in future. We have an obligation to ensure that we act accordingly.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	I agree with the Tánaiste. The concerns are truly national and island-wide, North to South and east to west. We have consistently told the Tánaiste and Taoiseach that where they pursue and secure those national interests we will back them and applaud them for their efforts. That is why clarity is so important at this juncture. The Tánaiste has described the very scenario to which we subscribe, namely, the maintenance of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts, including citizens' rights, the purview of the European Court of Justice, access to the European courts and, critically, the North remaining within the customs union and Single Market. At this juncture, the Dáil deserves a clear statement that the Government will not agree to anything which forces the North from the customs union and the Single Market. In the absence of that kind of clarity and a deal which secures that we are undoubtedly headed towards a border on the island of Ireland, the undermining of the Good Friday Agreement and everything else that might flow from that. I am not questioning the bona fides of the Tánaiste or the consistency of his public utterances, rather, I acknowledge them heartily. I ask for a statement of clarity, and a simple "Yes" or "No" will do. Can he confirm for the House that he will not agree to any deal which takes the North of Ireland out of the Single Market and the customs union?

This week, Deputy McDonald heard the Taoiseach and I outline our position in regard to the negotiations. As the Taoiseach said yesterday, this is a sensitive negotiation at a very sensitive time. Deputy McDonald will not get statements from which will stoke up what is already a difficult relationship management exercise. The Taoiseach and I intend to hold to what we said this week. Of course, we also want to be helpful in trying terms of trying to move this process on and provide reassurance for people on all sides that what the Government is advocating is good for everyone living on the island and can also be good for Britain. We will not support anything that, in our view, risks the re-emergence of a hard border on the island in the context of these negotiations.

Most people in the House will understand the sensitivities of that and the reasons why I should be somewhat cautious about what I say and how I say it. In that regard, let me reassure the Deputy that the statements we have made this week as a Government still stand and we will continue to act in the interests of the country as a whole.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	This is the week in which President Donald Trump has declared war on the people of Palestine and the wider Arab and Muslim world by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, an act which threatens to enflame conflict across the Middle East. Against that background of warmongering and increased militarism on the part of President Trump, it is more important than ever that Ireland holds onto its traditional position of military neutrality and opposition to warmongering and militarism. Yet, the Government has until this week quite successfully buried what is the biggest betrayal of Irish neutrality since the decision to allow US forces to use Shannon Airport to bomb Iraq back to the Dark Ages. The vote which will take place today on Ireland joining permanent structured co-operation on a new common defence project in the European Union is an absolute betrayal of Ireland's military neutrality. It is a step towards involvement in what is being explicitly touted by Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Federica Mogherini as a new European army and common defence pact. The Government has buried this. It misled the Business Committee. We were briefed by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, who did not know much about it. Yesterday he informed us that the decision was taken on 21 November. It was not mentioned in the two subsequent meetings of the Business Committee that the Government planned to push the vote through this week. There is no doubt the Government has briefed the media that there is nothing to see here and that this is not relevant or significant, and that there are no legal implications.  The truth is that Ireland is joining a common defence pact which will require it to regularly increase defence budgets in real terms to meet the 2% of GDP benchmark. That would mean a quadrupling of Irish defence expenditure. These are binding common commitments. It will involve bringing our defence apparatus into line with other member states, establishing permanent interoperability with NATO and increasing expenditure on arms and weaponry in order to benefit the European military industrial complex.Why has the Government misled the country and tried to bury this significant betrayal of Irish neutrality? Apart from everything else, is this not unconstitutional? Article 29.4.9° of our Constitution states: "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State." That is our State and this is a common defence. It is explicit and anybody who doubts it should read the PESCO agreement. We are signing up to a common defence in defiance of our own Constitution. The Government has misled the public and the Dáil while playing fast and loose with the Business Committee.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	I can agree with the Deputy on something, which is his concern about the recognition of Jerusalem yesterday by the United States and the instability to which that may possibly lead. I made contact with the US Embassy to express our concern when we heard reports that it might happen and we strongly made our view known that we did not think it was a good idea at this time. Jerusalem is one of the permanent status issues to be settled in a final Middle East peace agreement and it is closely interlinked with other permanent status issues. They should all be resolved together through negotiation in the context of a broader peace deal, of which Ireland wants to be very supportive. It is regrettable that the announcements yesterday evening will make the achievement of that agreement much more difficult. I do not agree with the Deputy on the attempt in this House by him and others to paint Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, as something it is not. I am a former Minister for Defence and I have listened to many debates about this initiative. The truth is this is simply a structured initiative that allows member states to opt in and opt out of different projects, depending on what they are comfortable with. We have other non-aligned and neutral countries like Sweden, Austria and Finland that have already signed up. From an Irish perspective, this is an opportunity for us to essentially share resources and access other resources in areas where we are comfortable in co-operation. It is no more or no less than that and it will work on a case by case basis. I suspect we will want to use this in terms of counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and training, with other areas potentially including marine surveillance. This is so Ireland can be part of collective initiatives when it is appropriate in the context of the European Union. As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, other countries will have a different view and they may want to get more involved in a more structured way in projects where we will not be involved. I ask the Deputy to call this what it is, as opposed to trying to create some kind of conspiracy that simply does not exist. This conversation has been happening since the Lisbon treaty and it is now something that is coming to finality following a long debate which has involved many countries, including neutral states, NATO members and others. Ireland, like others, insisted on language in setting up PESCO to ensure it is constitutional, that it does not undermine Irish neutrality and ensure the triple-lock still applies if we are to send troops to any other part of the world. From that perspective, we have tested this in the context of some of the questions asked by the Deputy. It does not undermine what is important to Irish people and to me, which is that Ireland remains non-aligned militarily and a neutral state.

I appeal to the public and press to simply read the document, Notification on Permanent Structured Cooperation. It refers to 20 binding commitments and there is no ambiguity about the language.

We are committing to the integration of Irish Defence Forces with NATO. We still have not got answers on the fact that it commits us to real increases in defence budgets, or a "successive medium-term increase in defence investment" and "increasing the share of expenditure allocated to defence research and technology". That will be reviewed on an annual basis. There is to be a national implementation plan to meet these targets. This is the military equivalent on the fiscal treaty and we are signing up to it. President Tusk has said the purpose of PESCO is to protect the bloc from the "effects of the migrant crisis and hostile bordering states". He is referring to the 35,000 people who have drowned in the Mediterranean, thanks to fortress Europe. These people want to militarise the wall that Donald Trump dreams of building to keep out those desperate people. This is what they are about. The Government has deceived the public. I have a simple request. Give us the legal advice that this does not run counter to Article 29 of our Constitution before we have to vote today. It would come from the Attorney General and say this does not run counter to Article 29 of the Constitution.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	173	I am glad the Tánaiste acknowledged the risks taken by members of our Defence Forces. Last week the State settled the first Lariam damages case by a member of the Defence Forces member. It is a very significant event in the Action Lariam campaign, which has been ongoing for several years. The plaintiff, Mr. Anthony Cole, stated he was delighted, giving an indication of the substantial damages that the State had to pay. This was a case where the State put up no defence of the indefensible, called no witnesses and adduced no evidence to defend the case. Instead, in an approach that would make the Garda Commissioner's legal team blush, the State launched a vicious attack on the plaintiff and his witnesses. His honesty was questioned and he was accused of perjury. The State's whole case was based on the argument that he was lying about the symptoms he suffered while in Chad. I know the Tánaiste knows from his time as Minister for Defence that some Defence Forces members who have taken Lariam have experienced very devastating consequences.They include nightmares, anxiety, hallucinations, depression, mood swings, mania and psychosis. Their experience of such utterly devastating effects is a medical fact, yet, knowing this, the State's entire case was that this individual was lying. We had ten days of hearings over five months, involving two senior counsel and two junior counsel, which caused huge stress for the plaintiff and at enormous cost to the State. Despite the finding in this case and the vote that took place in this House, Defence Forces policy remains the same. Lariam is the first choice anti-malarial drug for members serving in sub-Saharan Africa, including Mali. Saying "No" to Lariam is saying "No" to overseas duty. Admitting that one has a mental health problem means an end to one's Defence Forces career. It is an absolute disgrace. As we have seen time and again, the State will adopt an adversarial approach in medical injuries cases, which has resulted in long and unnecessary court processes. By the end of 2016, outstanding liabilities on the State for damages in cases in the areas of health, justice and defence were €2 billion, a staggering figure. The winners in all of this are the lawyers, to whom €24 million was paid out last year by the State Claims Agency, together with €41 million in plaintiff fees. In view of the massive costs involved and the fact that the State did not even bother to defend itself during this case, I have two questions for the Tánaiste. First, will the Government heed the outcome of the case and the motion passed in this House last summer by immediately issuing instructions to the Defence Forces to cease all use of Lariam? Second, will the Government take urgent steps to establish a redress or compensation scheme for members of the Defence Forces who were harmed by the taking of this terrible neuro-toxic drug and, in so doing, save the State a fortune in unnecessary and costly legal challenges?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	I remember having this debate with the Deputy when I was in the line Department. I said at the time that it was not for politicians to decide the medications prescribed in the Defence Forces or anywhere else because we were not qualified to do so. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have consistently sought to ensure responsible decisions are made, on the back of the best available medical advice, on the medication to be offered to personnel serving overseas. We have an obligation to protect members of the Defence Forces against malaria and ensure they are offered appropriate options. We have an obligation, too, to recognise that Lariam does have adverse effects on certain individuals. As such, it is important to have a clear screening process in place to identify individuals who may be adversely affected by the drug. These persons will be offered alternative medication or may choose not to participate in a mission to a part of the world where malaria is relevant. All of that is happening in the Defence Forces. I am not familiar with the legal case to which the Deputy referred and, as such, it would be dangerous for me to comment on it. I will, of course, ask the Minister of State to come back to her on whether that case sets a precedent. As I do not know the circumstances surrounding it, it would be wrong to offer any advice in that regard. I have met several families who have a member affected by Lariam and feel very strongly about the drug. We must handle this issue responsibly. We cannot, however, make decisions that are contrary to the best medical advice available to us. There is no simple answer when it comes to protecting our troops against malaria. We must take appropriate decisions based on medical advice and that is what we will continue to do.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	The best medical and practical advice the Government could take is to recognise that the State has just agreed to pay out substantial damages to a member of the Defence Forces who has been harmed by the use of Lariam. Against a backdrop where 42 members were prescribed the medication last year, why in God's name are we continuing to do this when there are other viable anti-malarial drugs on the market? It does not add up. The Tánaiste spoke about responsible decision making. I do not expect him to know the details of the case to which I referred, but I assure him they are relevant to the 60 other Lariam damage cases in the pipeline, with the likelihood that many others will join that list in the light of the Cole case which concluded last week. When the Tánaiste has examined the case and concluded that it does affect a broader group, will he then consider it reasonable to abandon the policy of pursuing adversarial court proceedings and instead take responsibility in this matter by agreeing to establish a redress or compensation scheme? Such schemes are in place in Australia and the United Kingdom. While neither is perfect, they both go some way towards dealing with the damage done by Lariam. The Government must intervene with the Defence Forces to prevent more people from potentially joining the numbers who will have to seek redress in the future.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	176	For many people who have used Lariam, including me, it has been very successful. There are individuals who are vulnerable to the drug, but not every case against the State is the same. The Department and the Defence Forces must make a decision on whether there is a precedent that needs to be adhered to following the settling of a particular case. It is unreasonable of the Deputy to ask me to comment on that case until I have seen the detail of it. In fairness to her, she has acknowledged this. It is a matter for the Minister of State at the Department of Defence to decide whether any particular action is necessary in this matter.

The Tánaiste referred earlier to the recognition by the President of the United States of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and his declared intention to establish the US embassy there. Israel's claim that Jerusalem is the complete and united capital of its country is in violation of international law. I remind the Tánaiste that this Sunday, 10 December, is the third anniversary of the Dáil unanimously passing a motion to recognise the state of Palestine, with east Jerusalem as its capital. We have had complete inaction on that motion. Will the Tánaiste give us a date for when the Government will move to recognise the state of Palestine?

We certainly would like to see the very difficult and sensitive issues of Jerusalem addressed in a way that is fair to both sides in that agreed settlement. That is why we are so uncomfortable with what happened yesterday because it recognises the ambitions of one side and not the other. I do not think we should be responding to what happened yesterday, and it would be seen as that, by formally recognising the state of Palestine. That potentially drives the two sides further apart.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health recently carried out pre-legislative scrutiny of the children's health Bill 2017 which will establish a statutory body to provide paediatric acute services in Dublin at the new children's hospital. The general scheme, as published, did not include a name for the hospital. We now see there is going to be legal action from the state of Arizona concerning the use of the name Phoenix. Many of us would like to call it the national children's hospital. Some have suggested it be appropriately called after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. That would be a fitting tribute. I suggest that we have a national competition, aimed at those who will use it, the children of Ireland. The Minister might consider organising a competition through the school system so that children can have an understanding and appreciation of the hospital and a validation through the children of an appropriate name for this vital infrastructure.

We are now getting on with it. I made clear yesterday that I am going to reflect further on the name. The Deputy makes a very good suggestion. Children were involved in this name, as were staff working in the health service, but I will work with colleagues across the House when I bring forward the legislation to come up with the best mechanism.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	On 1 December last year the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 that I tabled passed Second Stage and on 9 November 2017 it was agreed that it would go to Committee Stage. Last week, I received two documents on the same day, one from the Ceann Comhairle, for which I thank him, and one from the office of the Minister for Health stating that the Bill will be stifled on a money matter. It is pretty outrageous that people are playing politics with people's lives. The Minister will acknowledge that families, such as Vera Twomey's, and other individuals should never go through the torture that the Twomey family has gone through. They should not be medical exiles in this country. People should be prescribed medication in Ireland. I think the Minister for Health is on our side in some ways and he should let this Bill go forward to Committee Stage. Let us amend it together because it is not perfect, to help citizens of this country.

In respect of the Deputy's Bill I understood from the debate I participated in here that he had undertaken to do a lot of work to make that Bill acceptable to a majority of this House which it is not now. I know the Deputy will liaise with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in that regard and that is where it should best proceed.

The banks, especially AIB, are persecuting and not engaging with farmers and contractors who have serious borrowing issues and are before the courts. They refuse to deal with people like me and other Deputies or any intermediary. They want to drag people through the courts at enormous expense. I know a farmer from north Cork who has been dragged through the courts over a couple of years and wants to make a settlement but the bank will not engage or talk and will not accept a mediator. This is totally unacceptable. It has been happening to numerous farmers and business people. We own the blooming bank. Why can we not put some kind of manners on it? It is not getting much solace in the courts but will not listen to mediators. Where offers are made it will not engage. It is waiting to sell to vulture funds. What is going on is scandalous.

People in Cork with cataracts are waiting unreasonably long times, many over 18 months or two years. There are 6,900 outpatients waiting in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and there are a further 1,000 ahead of them in the South Infirmary inpatients unit. Their health is deteriorating as they wait. Those with reduced mobility are in danger of tripping and injuring their hips and hands. They are also isolated. The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is helpful but it is not dealing with the root cause. The eye care plan considers using the Sligo model but it has not been implemented. How soon will people in Cork see the results and reduced waiting lists? When will the process speed up and when will there be a lasting solution, for example, through the eye care plan?
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	The Deputy is correct the NTPF is working to reduce waiting times. In April there were over 1,600 people waiting over 15 months for cataracts in this country. That is now down to 412 at the start of December. We need to keep on doing more. The Deputy is correct that the primary care eye review is absolutely the way to go. I recently met with Billy Power, the clinical lead ophthalmologist, in respect of this and expect to enact it as part of the 2018 waiting list plan. We will move on that as part of the service plan.

Drugs task forces are on the front line co-ordinating a response to this growing problem. Now, in the middle of December, there is no agreement on the budgets for these task forces. This is impacting on staff who should be put on protective notice, community projects and making it impossible to plan for next year. Does the Minister for Health have any comments or can he update us on the budgets for these task forces?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	Before the Minister for Health replies I would like to use the opportunity, as Deputy Niall Collins did earlier, to recognise the role of An Garda Síochána in responding to organised crime and the drugs trade, and the serving member of the force who was shot this morning. I am glad to say his injury is not serious but it is a reminder to us of the extraordinary work the force is doing. An Garda Síochána has come in for some criticism in this House in recent years but this morning's incident is a reminder of the vital work it does. On the budgetary issues I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for the drugs strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to respond directly to the Deputy unless the Minister, Deputy Harris, wants to add anything.

Is it information that the Department does not want to put in the public domain, is it just sheer gross incompetence or does the Minister have another explanation as to why an elected Member of this House has waited for 11 weeks for a response from the Minister's Department and is still waiting?

Rumours have circulated in recent days that the minor works grant scheme for schools will not go ahead in 2018. I am glad the Minister is here. I am working with three school principals. They contacted me yesterday evening and this morning to say that if this happens in 2018, it will create serious difficulties for them. Will the Minister confirm or deny if the scheme will go ahead in 2018? I am representing those schools and know that many other schools around the country are in the same predicament.

It is paid for the school year, between September and June each year. As I confirmed this week, the payment for 2017 to 2018 will go ahead. I indicated that the payment for the 2018 to 2019 year will be conditional on availability of money, as it always is, and there is a possibility that it will not be paid within the calendar year of 2018 but would still be provided, as always, within the school year of 2018 to 2019.

This is in accordance with the principles specified in the charter of the United Nations, as required by section 3(2) of the 2009 Act. Yesterday, the Minister of State with responsibility for defence made a presentation and answered questions from members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence at which he set out the position on Ireland's intended participation in PESCO, subject to the approval of this House. It is also worth noting that the matter of Ireland's intention to participate in PESCO has been the subject of further extensive discussions. It has been the subject of European Council-----

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I understand they will be. My apologies. If not, if my office is listening, it should get them here. It is also worth noting that the matter of Ireland's intention to participate in PESCO has been the subject of further extensive discussions. It has been the subject of European Council and Foreign Affairs Council conclusions which have been debated and discussed in this House and its committees. It has also been considered through parliamentary questions, a Seanad Éireann Commencement matter and a Dáil Éireann Topical Issue debate. The wider context is that the European Union and its immediate neighbourhood face new and ever more complex challenges. These threats to international peace and security are multidimensional and transnational in nature. No country or member state acting on its own can address such challenges - it requires collective co-operation. The European Union's global strategy makes clear, in the face of these new and emerging threats and challenges, that the Union and its member states must take more responsibility for their own security and that of their citizens. The United Nations has also relied on regional organisations to act on its behalf in their own neighbourhoods. Therefore debate on this topic has to be seen in the context of the current international security environment and the ever-changing complex and intertwined nature of threats to our citizens, individual states and to international peace and security. In this regard, PESCO is a crucial mechanism which provides a treaty-based framework designed to improve the means by which EU member states can participate jointly in projects. This is designed to develop capabilities that will enhance crisis management and peacekeeping operations under the common security and defence policy, CSDP. CSDP is intended to provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on civilian and military assets which may be used on missions outside the Union for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Up to now, however, the European Union's capacity to mount crisis management operations has been hampered by the absence of essential capabilities and the political will from member states to commit the required capabilities for CSDP operations. This House will be aware that Ireland has always strongly supported the development of the CSDP and of EU capacity to respond to international crises in support of the UN and has participated in all aspects of CSDP since it was established. Ireland is one of the leading contributors to common security and defence policy operations deployed under UN mandates or with the support of the UN. Ireland has 13 civilian experts serving in eight of the ten civilian CSDP missions, including Palestine, Somalia, Niger, Mali, Ukraine, Georgia and Kosovo. Some 80 members of the Defence Forces are currently serving with distinction in three of the six military CSDP missions, including in Mali, where I had the privilege of visiting them, Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Mediterranean with Operation Sophia. Ireland has contributed Defence Forces personnel to EU missions in Chad and had provided two mission commanders to the EU training mission in Somalia. Our membership of the European Union and the United Nations allows Ireland to deepen and sustain democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights through, among other things, participating in overseas peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions which in turn helps to make Ireland more safe and secure. Participation in any PESCO project is entirely voluntary and it is a matter for each member state to decide for itself whether to participate on a case-by-case basis. While decisions remain to be taken on which PESCO projects we may wish to participate in, examples of the types of projects which Ireland is currently considering participating in include upgrade of maritime surveillance systems, development of unmanned underwater vehicles for protection of harbours and maritime systems, a centre of excellence for EU military training missions, and a cyber threats and incident response information sharing platform. PESCO has had the strong endorsement of the United Nations, which is important to note because, in essence, the United Nations is about trying to maintain a positive impact on global stability and peacemaking. It is supportive of what the European Union is doing in that regard in the context of PESCO. Speaking at the informal meeting of defence Ministers in Estonia last October, the UN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping supported the initiative as potentially providing additional capabilities for UN mandated operations. He repeated this point more recently in Vancouver at the UN Peace-Keeping Summit. PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability and, working with EU partners, ensuring that our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training. Participation in PESCO is provided for in the Treaty on European Union in Articles 42.6 and 46 and in Protocol 10. It was introduced under the Lisbon treaty and was voted upon by the Irish people. At Ireland’s insistence, PESCO's participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols. It fully respects constitutional provisions of all member states, including Ireland's. It is important to state that participation in PESCO has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality or the triple lock on the deployment of Irish forces overseas, that is, a UN Security Council resolution or mandate, Government decision and Dáil approval. This Government attaches great importance to our military neutrality. Over the past decades, successive Governments have restated their commitment to the policy and it remains as strong as ever under the current Government. That commitment was most recently set out in the White Paper on Defence which I published as Minister for Defence in August 2015. This reaffirmed that our policy of military neutrality remains a core element of Irish foreign policy, as had been previously re-articulated in the review of foreign policy entitled The Global Island which was published in January 2015. The Government is clear on our policy on military neutrality. We are also clear that participation in PESCO has no implications in that regard. Moreover, the protocols attaching to the Lisbon treaty specifically recognise Ireland’s policy of military neutrality where it is stated that "[t]he Lisbon Treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality". PESCO also has absolutely nothing to do with the creation of an EU army. None of the treaties provides for or allows the creation of an EU army. PESCO is simply about making more binding commitments to each other to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in support of CSDP operations. While the capabilities developed under PESCO can be used in CSDP operations, the deployment of those capabilities is still a matter for member states. PESCO will be implemented in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and its protocols, respecting the constitutional provisions of the member states. Four other non-aligned EU member states - Austria, Cyprus, Finland and Sweden - are already committed to join PESCO. PESCO was comprehensively debated in the context of the Lisbon treaty which was approved by the Irish people when they voted on the treaty in October 2009. PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon treaty protocol to address the concerns of the Irish people and in Ireland’s national declaration. The legislation setting down Ireland’s approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that vote and enacted in November 2009. Ireland, as a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security in support of the UN, wishes to remain fully engaged in all CSDP processes. Fully participating in these developments ensures that we continue to have a voice and that we can influence the evolution of all initiatives, including PESCO. The question of whether Ireland is rushing into PESCO has been raised. I do not accept that this is the case. The notification was painstakingly discussed over a number of months. Irish officials were involved at every stage of the drafting process and the final text reflects their contribution. At all stages it was clear to partners that Irish participation was subject to a Government decision and Dáil approval and this is why Ireland did not sign the notification at the Foreign Affairs Council last month, when many other countries did.  It is particularly important that Ireland would move forward at the same time as our other EU partners, including in the security and defence domain, so as to protect our interests and values at a critical juncture in the future development of the European Union post-Brexit. PESCO is a key initiative in this regard. There are some misunderstandings which seem to have taken hold in some quarters regarding the commitments entered into by member states participating in PESCO. There is absolutely no commitment to increasing Ireland’s defence expenditure to 2% of Ireland’s GDP. The increase in real terms relates to meeting the agreed objectives of PESCO and not to Ireland’s overall defence budget. The figure of 2% referred to in the PESCO notification solely reflects a collective commitment by the participating member states to spend 2% of their defence expenditure on research and technology. This House will recognise that such a commitment would in Ireland’s case amount to a minuscule fraction of the figures heralded by some people who appear to be scaremongering in this regard. Deputies will be aware that projected expenditure for the Department of Defence for the period 2018 to 2020 was set out on budget day. Nothing has changed in this respect except that PESCO will allow member states to pool resources with a view to achieving greater value for money with respect to their expenditure. All commitments are entered into "while respecting constitutional provisions of the member States". Ireland secured the inclusion of this wording as the Dáil is sovereign with respect to all decisions on expenditure. A decision to participate in PESCO is entirely voluntary. Any decision to step out of PESCO would equally be entirely voluntary. However, a decision to leave would likely result in a member state having less influence on the direction of the EU common foreign and security policy as inevitably that member state would be seen as less committed to the CSDP. The House will be aware of the ongoing debate on security and defence issues and on the future of the European Union. The EU’s global strategy makes clear that our union needs to take greater responsibility for its security and that of its citizens. Important contributions to this debate are being made, including most recently by President Macron of France and by EU Commission President Juncker. Brexit is clearly having an impact on the direction of the debate as well. Different views have been expressed across member states. Ireland will engage in the debate on the future of Europe in a constructive manner and in full respect for the treaties and Ireland’s Lisbon protocol which reflect our traditional policy of military neutrality and that is not going to change. Where we must disagree, we will make our position clear but this Government is committed to participating in CSDP to the greatest extent possible consistent with our values and constitutional provisions. I believe that all members of this House are extremely proud of the contribution our Defence Forces make in support of international peace and security. Participation in PESCO will allow these men and women to gain access to the latest and best equipment and training.This will help enhance their capabilities for peacekeeping operations and, above all, ensure their security and safety when deployed on some of the most challenging peacekeeping missions. When the Defence Forces are deployed overseas, they never do so alone. They always work in close co-operation with other countries. PESCO is a means of enhancing interoperability with project partners, enabling them to be even more effective at the peacekeeping for which they are renowned. More than ever, with Brexit and emerging and increasing security challenges in our neighbourhood and beyond, it is important that the European Union can demonstrate unity and cohesiveness. To that end, in seeking the support of our EU colleagues on our priorities, it is important that we act in step in shared areas of concern, including security and defence initiatives such as PESCO. As I said, Ireland's participation in PESCO in no way diminishes or undermines our traditional policy of military neutrality; rather, Ireland's participation in PESCO will contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for UN-mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the UN charter. I commend the motion to the House.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	I reiterate my support and that of my party for the motion and the Defence Forces and State in joining and engaging with PESCO. PESCO is not about creating a European army or undermining our neutrality, which is simply false. What it is about is deepening our co-operation with other member states with which we are already part of a union. It is about working together, building co-operation, sharing knowledge and ideas, pooling resources, generating better economies of scale, providing better training for members of the Defence Forces and, ultimately, ensuring peace and stability across the European Union for citizens to protect them. We can benefit from the shared funding of overseas missions. As I stated, we can share knowledge. There are activities at which we are very good in this country in terms of defence, but there are also activities at which other countries may be slightly better. Why not work together? Why not share knowledge? Why adopt an insular approach, close everybody out and just work among ourselves? When has that ever been the best idea? The effects of joining PESCO are many and positive. It reinforces the fact that we are fully committed to the European Union and its ideals and values. We engaged in all aspects of the process and ensured the Irish voice and concerns were heard, as reflected in the draft. Particularly in the context of Brexit and in a post-Brexit scenario, it is extremely important that we, as a member state which is fully committed to the European Union, show our support for it and all of its values, including common security and defence policy, which we have had a huge role in developing. We will gain a lot from joining PESCO. We will have members of the Defence Forces who will be better trained and equipped and have more knowledge. They will ultimately be safer when they go on overseas missions to represent the country. There are many times when Members across the House laud the members of the Defence Forces for their fantastic work and humanitarian actions overseas, including on their peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, a point I have made several times. The troops do not go overseas on a holiday. They go on extremely dangerous missions to protect innocent lives, represent the country and put their own lives at risk. They are sacrificing a lot in their lives and those of their families. Therefore, the last thing I want, as spokesperson on defence and somebody who advocates for the Defence Forces, is to send our troops overseas knowing that they have not been trained as best they can be. That is why working with other member states and gaining experience in working with other member states can leave us safe in the knowledge that we are providing the most up-to-date training we can for the Defence Forces. I do not understand how, on the one hand, someone can support our participation in overseas missions and accept that they are dangerous and, on the other, only want members of the Defence Forces to train at home and not engage with the defence forces of other member states. The two ideals do not marry. Marrying them does not make sense to me. Nobody on the other side of this debate has yet articulated how he or she can justify his or her position. As mentioned, PESCO was referred to in the Lisbon treaty in 2009. We ratified that treaty. Therefore, this is not a new idea. It has been on the table for quite some time. Many Deputies have complained and articulated certain views to the effect they have not had an opportunity to brief themselves properly on PESCO, to discuss this issue or raise it with the Minister. I disagree. I have had an ample opportunity to brief myself on it. In holding my portfolio I have a duty to know how PESCO will work, what it is about and whether it is good for the country. Based on an informed position, having educated myself on it, I am of the firm belief it is a good idea. I am of the firm belief I had plenty of opportunities to engage with the Government on it, including by asking questions in this House and at the committee meeting yesterday. Therefore, I absolutely reject the contention that the debate has not been adequate. If, however, Members believe the debate has been inadequate, they may take comfort in the fact that joining PESCO will certainly require a more robust debate on defence in the future. That is something from which we have to learn in this House. I would certainly welcome having more time to debate defence issues. I do not believe enough time is allocated to debate many of the issues affecting the Defence Forces and defence policy. It is regrettable that many Members are probably not as up to speed on defence issues as they should be. It is potentially a failing of the House not to provide Members with adequate time, resources and materials with which to brief themselves. I would certainly welcome more time to debate such matters. Part of the reason we co-operate with other member states and the key reason we engage in UN missions is that we want to contribute, as citizens of a member state of the European Union and as global citizens, to peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions to ensure peace and security across the globe. We are global citizens; we do not live in an insular society and are affected. We cannot adopt the approach that these are matters for other countries, not us. If our shores were threatened, we would very quickly look to other member states for assistance, rightly so. It should be a two-way process. Joining PESCO means that, as a state, we will have to up our game on defence issues. We will have to do more to ensure we have an up-to-date, modern, progressive and efficient defence policy and proper equipment to deal with the ever-changing threats the country faces and the ever-globalising environment in which the Defence Forces operate. Many concerns have been raised by other groups. I have received correspondence and representations from citizens on this issue and the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA. They are concerned that co-operating with and joining PESCO somehow undermines our neutrality, but I have yet to see any evidence of this from anybody in the House. We have a militarily neutral position which is constitutionally protected and the triple lock mechanism remains in place. We will only engage on a project by project basis. If any Member can lay before the House evidence of how neutrality is being undermined, not just rhetoric or an opinion, I will be all ears, but I have yet to see it. There are many who suggest joining PESCO is somehow the start of the development or coming together of a European army. On reading the draft of the text and understanding what PESCO involves, I cannot understand how anybody can suggest it somehow implies a European army. If Members would like to lay before the House evidence which supports that suggestion, I will be all ears and will be very pleased to consider it. Some Members have suggested we should not join PESCO and that we should stay out of it. There are a couple of reasons I believe that would be a bad move for the country. First, as I have stated, I believe it is our job and responsibility to ensure the Defence Forces are trained as best they can be. Not working with other member states, areas, people and armies with expertise is not just bad for the country and the Defence Forces, it is also reckless. We will ultimately put the lives of members of the Defence Forces in danger if we send them overseas in the knowledge that they have not been properly trained and could have been better trained. Not joining PESCO would send the wrong message to our partners, neighbours and friends across Europe. It would afford us less influence in dealing with the Common Security and Defence Policy. I absolutely agree. Not joining would show that we were less committed to working with other member states to ensure security and peace across the European Union. It would also leave us as an outlier in the European Union in defence matters.It will leave us politically marginalised. It will deteriorate our own defence capacity because we will be working alone. Again, I see no argument as to why that would be a good thing and I think it would ultimately diminish our peacekeeping options, the very thing we hold dear. Citizens take huge pride in overseas missions in which the Defence Forces participate and Member after Member in this House across the board has lauded them as fantastic. We need to give a commitment to this House that while we are joining PESCO and see the benefits of it, we also hear the concerns of Members and of some citizens and we will commit to more robust and extensive debate on defence policy and defence issues in this House and at committee level on a more regular basis. Deputy Brendan Smith, the committee Chairman, would have no difficulty with that. We also need to give a commitment in this House that we are prepared to review the PESCO arrangements on an ongoing basis to ensure that it always represents the best option, as it does right now, for this country. We must further give a commitment to Members in this House that there will be full engagement with all Members across the House on any project in which we participate to ensure there is, at best, the most consensus that we can achieve in terms of our participation in those projects. There needs to be far better engagement in terms of parliamentary questions and notification to Members on an ongoing basis, perhaps in report form on a quarterly basis from the Department, as to how PESCO is working, what engagements we have with it and what is expected of us on an ongoing basis. Such a report would be most helpful to ensure that Members are the most up to date they can be and that there can be no argument that Members or citizens do not know what is going on. It is our job to be properly informed and some assistance from the Department, the Government and the Minister would be most appreciated. It is very important to note that joining PESCO is very much supported by the Defence Forces. I congratulate and commend the work of the officials who have engaged on this throughout the process in terms of articulating the Irish position on neutrality, the constitutional provisions in terms of defence policy and airing the concerns some citizens and some Members of this House have. All those things were taken on board and the draft text reflects that. One of the concerns raised at the committee yesterday was that joining PESCO requires us to increase defence spending. I have no difficulty with that. We need to increase defence spending. The defence budget is paltry. It does not allow us to build the proper capabilities we need. It does not allow us to run properly functioning Defence Forces. Other Members in this House come into the Chamber on a regular basis talking about how underfunded and under-resourced the Defence Forces are yet one of their big concerns is an increase in defence spending in the context of PESCO. How does one marry the two? I cannot. We need to increase defence spending. We are one of the lowest spenders in the European Union. One of the positives of joining PESCO is that it will force the Government and the Department to properly fund and resource the Defence Forces and properly develop a robust defence policy that will prepare the country and ensure it is protected and properly participating in the common security and defence policy across the European Union. It is important to send the message to members of the Defence Forces that we very much support them in the work they do. We are very proud of the work they do and we want to work with them to ensure that they have access to the best information, knowledge and training. One of the key benefits of joining PESCO is that we will now be able to work with other member states in research and developing technologies across the defence sector. That is not about building weapons. It is about building knowledge and building technology in terms of surveillance to protect our waters and the State and building capacity to work with other member states in terms of sharing information in order to protect citizens and protect the State. As a small country we do not have the capacity to do all that ourselves. We will benefit from economies of scale. We will benefit from working with larger member states and their resources to conduct research and develop technologies we know we need. One of the areas of vulnerability recently highlighted in the State, where every member state is vulnerable, is cybersecurity. We do not have the capacity or the capability to do all that research on our own. We need to work with other member states because cyberattacks do not know jurisdictions or boundaries. They work across all countries. We are all facing the same threats together. The notion that somehow this country is safe and untouchable has proven to be completely untrue. We know that we are not safe from cyberattacks and we know they can happen. Joining PESCO sends a very strong message, that we are aware of the threats, that we know there are multiple threats and that they are constantly changing and adapting. We know the threats are sophisticated but also that we are not alone as other member states face the same difficulties we face. This is about deepening co-operation, working with like-minded member states to ensure we can protect citizens and have the most up-to-date technology to try to combat the threats. While there will always be difficulties and opposing views, in particular in the area of defence, which at times is quite emotive and is controversial, and while there are times when we will never agree on certain positions, coming from an informed position, having had an opportunity over an extended period to educate myself on what PESCO is about, what it involves and what the benefits are to the State and the Defence Forces, I have no difficulty in supporting and commending the motion. I ask other Members to consider very strongly how they can marry the two positions, first, that we will support the Defence Forces and that we want them to do overseas missions while on the other hand we do not want them to train or work with other countries and, second, how we want the Defence Forces to be properly funded and resourced yet we do not want to increase defence spending.

The simplistic claptrap we heard from Deputy Lisa Chambers is a disgrace. It is obvious that she has not listened in this Chamber or in the committee to anything I or others have said. I know of nobody in this Dáil who wants the Defence Forces to run on a shoestring budget. Nobody in this Chamber wants Irish soldiers to be sent overseas without proper protection or equipment. Deputy Lisa Chambers should remember her own party's history, as it was responsible for sending soldiers overseas unprepared and ill equipped. What we have argued for in this Chamber is that the Defence Forces should be properly paid.

I will address the Chair. Those of us in this Chamber want the Defence Forces to have the equipment, pay and conditions and protection required when they carry out humanitarian operations overseas as part of their laudable history of peacekeeping. It is when one starts interfering with the sovereignty and neutrality of the Irish State in the way outlined in the motion that we start to have a very serious problem. The Government is trying to push through a motion which is being presented as if it is one of the many European Defence Agency or other military motions. It is a case of there is nothing to see, move on. Deputy Crowe and I introduced a Topical Issue on the matter. Out of the blue, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicated to the European Union that the Government would sign up to PESCO. There was no expectation of that. It was out of sync.I am not surprised because that is the agenda of Fine Gael. However, it came out of the blue at the time. We know of this agenda because it was apparent at the time of the first Lisbon treaty referendum. That was the first attempt by the two parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, to pull the wool over the eyes of the Irish electorate. When voters rejected it the parties cobbled together a triple lock. I was active during the debate on the two referendum campaigns and I argued that the triple lock was no more than an attempt to bamboozle the public, and that is what happened. I believe the motion before the House is in direct violation of Article 29.4.9o of the Constitution. That provision holds that a Government cannot adopt any EU decision that would create a European common defence mechanism. I realise the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Defence are not present, but I am not complaining about the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. The Minister for Defence is the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and people should remember that this falls fully on his table. We are moving in the direction of a European common defence. Each step that has been taken in recent years has moved towards that end. One need only listen to the comments of European Commission President, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker. He made these remarks on 17 September, so I am not going back into history. He said that he foresees a fully-fledged defence union by 2025. I have before me the Commission infograph and I can give it to the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, if he so wishes. The document suggests that a particular area might be a chief area by 2021. There is an agenda and the sequence is laid out nicely for us in the document as it is exactly where they want to go. That is another lesson that people can look at to see the intention of the European Union bureaucrats and their representatives. I have no wish for the Defence Forces or our foreign policy to be in any way subservient to the EU or NATO, but that is what we are doing. I have no wish for Ireland to be a cog in an ever-increasing military structure or for our money to be diverted from the social fund into military research and development. We had that argument in the House not long ago. Increasingly, we are going to become dependent on an EU military programme that will not be under our control. Part of the PESCO arrangement is that there will be oversight by others of our defence spend. Our independence and sovereignty is being undermined. It is also intended that we would be involved in enforcing peace. One need only go back to the Lisbon treaty and the changes made at the time. We were told that was not something we would ever have to sign up for. Yet, that is exactly the type of mission PESCO and the battlegroups undertake. I am sorry - I gather I cannot use the term "battlegroups". It seems it was a bad title to give the arrangement. Apparently, it was a mistake and those involved should not have let the cat out of the bag in that way. Deputy Chambers was present for some of the proceedings of the committee. It was not really a committee, rather it was a question-and-answer session with a Minister of State. We could not bring in any experts - I include the Minister of State in that cohort because he could not even answer half of the questions. Why now? What is the rush? Why do it at all? Such were the questions asked by virtually everyone, but the Minister of State did not give any proper answers. The EU army may not necessarily be called the "EU Army" any more than the Irish Army is called the Army, because it is called the Defence Forces. Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker has said that if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then what else could it be? That is what it is. It is an EU army with a military structure and a headquarters. Conveniently, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces was touted as the person who would be in charge. He did not get the job but those responsible still put him forward for it. There is an EU military headquarters. What is that? It is an army headquarters. An army has soldiers and equipment and continuously increases its operations. The problem with the operations and the people who are dictating all of this is that they are the same people who are former imperialists. Imperialist adventures are still afoot in Africa today. In whose interests is it to invade or force peace in different states in Africa? It is in the interests of the same people who are at the top of the agenda in terms of pushing PESCO. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, argued that people are mistaking the position on the 2% requirement and said that the only mention of 2% relates to research. I am sorry, but he is wrong. The 2% that we have discussed is the 2% level of spending that President Donald Trump told the NATO countries that they had to achieve, if not exceed. Even if we took it that we were increasing our military spend to the EU average, we would be increasing the military spend by the State threefold or fourfold. We should increase our spend, but we should do it when we can afford it and when we have addressed the other major social ills. We should do it to increase the pay and conditions of those in the Defence Forces first and foremost. Then, we should look at ensuring that they are properly protected and that they have the proper equipment. However, we should not do it at a time when there are people dying of the streets of Dublin and Cork. What would it take to achieve the 2% level of spending sought by President Donald Trump and the NATO countries, the vast majority of which control the agenda of PESCO? The relevant figure is €2.5 billion rather than the €500 million being spent at the moment. That might come under the Department of Defence Vote, as the Minister suggested yesterday. Everything in this House comes under one Vote or another. We are not arguing that point, but we maintain that someone else will be pulling the strings and setting the agenda for us and our military spend in future. I hope the Dáil will reject PESCO as an attack on our neutrality.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	On Monday 13 November, 22 EU defence ministers signed the permanent structured co-operation agreement, known as PESCO. Ireland was not one of the 22 to sign up, but today we are debating and voting on Ireland's involvement in what will be an EU army. Once again, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are joining forces to try to ram through and fast-track a debate that will undermine Ireland's neutrality without sufficient debate and scrutiny by the Oireachtas and the public. Considering the lip service of these parties to Irish neutrality and the popularity of Irish neutrality among the public, this approach comes as no surprise. I am particularly disappointed and aggrieved with the behaviour of members of the so-called Independent Alliance, who not long ago shared these Opposition benches with us. When in opposition, they repeatedly and loudly spoke out in favour of Irish neutrality. Two years ago, they supported a Bill to hold a referendum enshrining neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann. Shortly afterwards, they supported Deputy Wallace's Bill to affirm Ireland's neutrality in the Constitution by adherence to the provisions of the 1907 Hague Convention on neutrality. The same people now sit at the Cabinet table. They had the opportunity to stop this two weeks ago but not one of them had the moral courage or the resolve to speak out, stand up for Irish neutrality and vote against this departure. Perhaps they did not hear or chose not to listen to Frederica Mogherini, who said that the dream of creating an EU defence union was no longer a dream, but had now become a reality. PESCO will lead to the creation of an EU army. It is everything we predicted it would be during the Lisbon treaty debates. This is not about anti-terrorist measures and keeping people safe, as the Government spin would have it. There is already co-operation in the justice and policing area for that end. This is about creating an EU army to complement NATO and an EU defence union to enrich weapon makers and dealers. Despite being attacked by the establishment parties and a compliant media as scaremongers, we again have been proven correct on the dangerous and increased militarist direction that the EU has taken as well as on the priority it is now placing on militarisation projects. During the debate the official statement of the Government was that the Lisbon treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. We knew this was entirely bogus at the time and events and actions have proven that we were correct.Yesterday the Taoiseach told the House that PESCO was nothing new and just part of the Lisbon treaty. It is not some benign humanitarian force. Its mandate, as outlined in the Lisbon treaty, includes the requirement for participating states to make troops available for deployment as part of PESCO missions. There is no arrangement for opting in or out.  Ireland's deeper integration into the European Union's military system is completely unacceptable and not wanted by the vast majority of Irish people. If the motion is passed, the fight against PESCO will not end. Ireland's involvement in PESCO would violate Article 29.4.9° of Bunreacht na hÉireann which states the Government cannot adopt any European Union decision that would create an EU common defence, as outlined in Article 42 of the Lisbon treaty. A constitutional challenge is guaranteed and the courts will rule on this matter. I find it particularly disturbing that the Government and the European Union argue that they do not have any spare money for positive social and economic programmes such as youth employment projects, community regeneration and improving public services, for example, health care and supports for children and adults with special needs, yet they have announced that €1.5 billion will be spent each year on a regressive military project to ultimately facilitate a standing EU army. PESCO's own benchmark is to increase defence investment expenditure by 20%. We have serious housing, homelessness and health crises which are getting worse every week. The Government states it has no additional money to tackle social and economic problems, yet it can miraculously find millions of euro to buy weapons. I know where my priorities for investment lie. It is time to end this farce by voting against Ireland joining this EU army. We must have a referendum to enshrine neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann. The Government must give the people their democratic say on neutrality once and for all. This debate reminds me of the Government's attitude to the use of Lariam. It states there is no problem with the drug, despite clear evidence to the contrary. One only needs to speak to one of the soldiers who have taken Lariam and whose lives have been destroyed by it. The Government seems to operate in a parallel reality in which it sees no problem with joining PESCO, whereas the truth is much different.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	The Labour Party is calling on the Government to halt a vote on Ireland involvement in the permanent structured cooperation, PESCO, arrangement as we have not had a sufficient national debate on the matter. The impact of joining PESCO could fundamentally alter Ireland's sovereign defence policy and history of neutrality for decades to come. It is too important a matter to rush through a vote as the Government is attempting to do in this manner this week against a false deadline. The Labour Party has been asking for a debate on this issue since June when my party leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, asked the Taoiseach to outline his approach on security and defence issues, including his view on enhanced integration at European Union level. We have noticed that the Taoiseach always carefully parses his words on this matter, focusing on security and speaking very little about defence. In June he made the following statement in the Dáil:I will offer Ireland's continuing solidarity and our strong commitment to working closely with our partners in combating this growing threat. The meeting will send out a strong message that Europe stands united and firm against terrorism, hatred and violent extremism. No one has any problem with this statement as we all stand united against the threat of extremism and terrorism and know that there are threats to global and regional security. In recent years new threats have been added to old ones, which is further complicating an already complex picture of regional security. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, competition for natural resources, energy dependence, climate change, failed states, terrorism, cyberattacks, erosion of regional and global arms control agreements, disinformation campaigns and organised crime continue to be important threats and challenges which Europe must address. They are diverse and affect member states in different ways, which explains the difficulty in reaching a common position in countering them. It is vital, therefore, that member states spend more time evaluating these threats and challenges. The Government is not giving us more time, however, despite calls from this side for several months that the issue be discussed in the Dáil and examined properly by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence. By this, I do not mean a box ticking exercise such as that which occurred yesterday.  With this plan the European Commission is proposing to add €500 million of EU funds in 2019 and 2020 to finance EU defence research and new military development. After 2020 the figure will increase to €1.5 billion every year for research and the development of new military technology. This plan clearly amounts to overt militarisation of the European Union. The video released by the European Union in support of PESCO is more like a movie trailer for "Top Gun 2" than anything else. I agree with the assessment of Deputy Mick Wallace, whose contribution on the issue alerted me to the video, that it glorifies military expenditure on fighter jets, battleships and heavy weaponry. Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's comment that joining PESCO would not mean that we would enter the market for heavy weaponry or warships, this video, the language used by the Commission and the intentions of some of our EU partner states are such that an increasingly militarised European Union is clearly an objective. We do not want Ireland to be clipped to the tail of this wagon and dragged inexorably towards an EU army. The promotional video demonstrates the real motivation behind PESCO and we need to stand fast against it now by applying the brakes and returning to first principles with regard to the Defence Forces. This requires that we invest in our current personnel and ensure they are being paid enough and do not have to rely on family income supplement, as 20% of members of the Defence Forces currently do.  We must modernise barracks and thereby improve the professional working environment for the men and women of the Defence Forces. We must also invest in promoting greater participation by women and minority communities in the ranks. We first need to get our own house in order before moving towards any other iteration of purpose for the Defence Forces. To this end, we should further promote our reputation for participating in peacekeeping and rescue missions. We should make Ireland a shining example in Europe for making conflict zones safe, saving lives and working to end wars and conflict. We have a proud record in disarmament as the architects of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1960s. We led the charge at the United Nations and have continued throughout the history of the United Nations to strengthen and re-energise it through the new agenda coalition in the 1990s and, more recently, playing a key role in pushing for a conference on a Middle East nuclear free zone. Sadly, the proposed conference did not take place. Ireland also hosted the cluster munitions conference in 2009. Despite our size, we have always been a world leader in promoting peace and disarmament and have never supported militarisation. We are not a member of NATO and do not take a triumphalist, macho view of our military strength. We take pride in the role the Defence Forces have played in providing real leadership in the toughest of tasks, namely, maintaining peace, providing help for the most vulnerable and standing up for global nuclear disarmament. In an increasingly insecure world people do not want more bombs, bullets and jets. They want developed nations to set an example as peacekeepers and peacemakers. Ireland can be one such nation. However, the European Council has clearly taken steps to intensify co-operation on defence matters and a plan is in place to expand the range of common military activities undertaken. This has been designed to complement NATO structures, but Ireland is not a member of NATO. What is its position on these steps which have been driven by France and Germany in a move towards enhanced military integration which has been embraced wholeheartedly by the European Commission? This approach is gathering pace as a result of the exit from the European Union of the United Kingdom which had traditionally opposed it, viewing any co-operation under the umbrella of the European Union as a duplication of NATO activities. Let us a have a proper debate on this issue. Given the Government's commitment to having commissions and committees, let us have a committee on national defence strategy in the context of the militarisation of the European Union. The issue could be addressed by the joint committee which could hear from all stakeholders. Let us bring in the Defence Forces to get their views. Let us bring in PANA and speak to academics, defence experts and the disarmament section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Give us, as politicians and public representatives who hold dear the principle of neutrality and peace, a chance to engage in a real debate on this matter. At a minimum, we must have a full debate in the House. We call on the Government to stop this move and remove the need for a vote from the Order Paper. It is making a grave error in pushing for a vote this week.I firmly believe this. The Minister needs to go back to the Council and say Ireland is not ready. We have not discussed this thoroughly enough. We do not always have to be the good boys and girls in Europe. We can say "No" on matters that fundamentally go against the grain for our island. It does not make us any less committed to the core EU project, the maintenance of peace on our Continent, the free movement of people and trade and working together for a prosperous and social Europe. This does provide work on common foreign and security policies but it does not necessarily mean we need a common defence policy which requires military build-up. If we go through with this vote and, it seems, with Fianna Fáil support confirmed today, the Government and the people of Ireland will look back on this in years to come as the moment we crossed the precipice and moved Ireland in the direction of militarisation of the EU. It may take a few more incremental steps after this one but, as the old saying goes, "The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step". This is a significant step today, if it happens. We do not want to make this journey. We cannot be bounced or cajoled, or indeed tricked, into this process without rigorous debate. This comes down to trust. The Government is asking this House to rubber-stamp a commitment to PESCO without a full and robust debate, without a proper committee hearing and without hearing from outside experts. The Government is asking us to trust it that Ireland can opt in or opt out of particular elements of PESCO which suits us. We do not believe such an à la carte approach will work in the real world. Such promises and assurances cannot be taken on faith alone without a debate. Five of the eight groupings in the Dáil supported a motion to delay this vote but we in the Labour Party were shocked to see Fianna Fáil support the Government in pushing this through. The debate was not about the pros and cons of PESCO but about giving this House more time to discuss it properly, and Fianna Fáil voted with the Government. It did not merely abstain, as it has done in the past but it voted with the Government against the amending motion, which is put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett but reflects the views expressed at the Business Committee as to what should happen. The so-called architects of Ireland's historic neutrality stance seem ready and willing to roll the dice on the militarisation of the European Union. This is astonishing. I again call on the Minister to withdraw the motion. He should tell the EU that the Irish Parliament is not satisfied and that we require a proper debate through the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence. This 11 December deadline is a false one. We can join at any time. That is legally the case. On many occasions, the Minister has been asked to justify the deadline and he has failed miserably to do so. There is no deadline of 11 December. We can join at any time. That is a fact. The Minister should reject it and come back to us. If he believes in new politics, he should bring this back to us and let us discuss it through the defence committee and in this House.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	I wish to share time with Deputy Bríd Smith. The Government is pulling a fast one here and Fianna Fáil is collaborating, indeed colluding with it in that. That should be no surprise. Fianna Fáil brought eternal shame on this country in allowing the US military use Shannon Airport to prosecute the criminal US assault on Iraq which resulted in as many as 1 million deaths, 4 million people forced to flee their homes, the absolute destruction of Iraqi society and, ultimately, laid the seeds for the destabilisation of Syria that is now unfolding in the most horrific way. All of those matters are directly connected. We facilitated that, and the two major parties in this country supported it - to the tune of well over 1 million troops going through Shannon to prosecute that horrific war. It should come as no surprise that the two main parties that pretend to be in opposition to one another are now also colluding in further abandoning our military neutrality as part of joining up to the evolving European army and the development and reinforcement of the European military industrial complex. It is shameful. The process behind this was deeply cynical. The decision to sign off on this was made on 14 November and then confirmed at the Cabinet on 21 November. The Government knew, but the Chief Whip did not indicate to the Business Committee, despite several meetings taking place, that there was any intention to put this on the agenda for a vote, and then turned up this week, on Monday, stating, we were to have a vote on joining PESCO. The Business Committee orders the business of the Dáil and gives indications at least two weeks in advance of something happening. At neither of those meetings did the Government give any signal that this was coming up. Deputy Clare Daly raised the question of what was happening with PESCO and there was not a word from the Government about a vote. This was deliberate. The Government gambled that, given all the focus on Brexit and the rush of legislation in the past couple of weeks, this story would be buried and ignored by the media. It has largely succeeded in doing that. It is shameful because this is the biggest move away from our military neutrality since the momentous and disastrous decision to facilitate the US military at Shannon during the Iraq war in the teeth of overwhelming public opposition, reflected in one of the biggest demonstrations that ever happened in the history of the State and clearly in opinion polls. Every opinion poll that has been taken on it shows that the people oppose that decision. This decision is the biggest departure from military neutrality since that decision. The Government is now seeking to deceive us as to the real content of this motion. Let me read from the EU fact sheet on PESCO. It refers to, "enhanced coordination, increased investment in defence and cooperation in developing defence capabilities". It goes on, "The difference between PESCO and other forms of cooperation is the binding nature of the commitments undertaken by participating Member States". Deputy Lisa Chambers, who was looking for evidence, should read the fact sheet. The "binding nature" is the difference. It goes on to state, "It will be a driver for integration in the field of defence". What is a common defence, which is precluded in the Constitution? It states that this will be a driver for integration of a common defence. The fact sheet goes on to state that there will be implementation plans that will be subject to regular assessment. The PESCO body in the European Union will tell us whether or not we are meeting the binding commitments to ramp up military expenditure and involve ourselves in the PESCO project. The fact sheet could not be more explicit, stating, "This is different from the voluntary approach that is currently the rule within the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy". It is not the voluntary approach, which the Minister claimed it was. It is not voluntary; it is binding. We are moving into a binding enhanced defence pact. When one looks at what the major architects are saying about this, it is absolutely clear what they are talking about. One need only look at who the main players are. President Macron of France is talking about putting boots on the ground in Libya, as if they did not do enough damage there. One looks at the destruction of Libya as a result of French and western bombing of that country and the refugee disaster that has come from it. Now they are talking about further exacerbating that.I will repeat the quote from the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk. He specifically referred to the objective of PESCO as "to protect the bloc from the effects of the migrant crisis, hostile bordering states and forces that risk tearing the bloc apart". It does not get more explicit and, frankly, disgusting than that. What does he mean by "protect ... from the effects of the migrant crisis"? It means a military machine to stop desperate people fleeing from Libya, Syria and other places in which the west was responsible for causing the initial chaos. Now we are going to ramp up military defence and be part of keeping those people out. What are the "hostile bordering states" for which we need this common defence policy and to increase military expenditure? There is no doubt that this is an abandonment of our neutrality and a move into a common defence. I believe it is unconstitutional. It is counter to Article 29.4.9° of the Constitution and it should be challenged. We will have to seriously consider challenging it on constitutional grounds if the Government refuses to pull back from this shameful decision to abandon Ireland's military neutrality.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	I thank Deputies Boyd Barrett, Ó Snodaigh, Healy and Clare Daly - I apologise if I have omitted anybody - because without the voice of the Opposition demanding a debate on this and continually raising it this week both at the Business Committee and on the floor of the House, we would not be having this debate. It was clear that the Government did not want to have a discussion and that this was being quickly sneaked through. Without those Deputies we would not be having this discussion. It is remarkable that defence spending will jump from €900 million per year to between €3 billion and €4 billion per year. It is remarkable given that this is a day after we lost another homeless woman on the streets of this State. We cannot house the homeless and we cannot provide pension equality for people who are retiring. We are told it cannot be done because it would cost €70 million. Suddenly, however, we can find all these billions to fund arms. We need homes and decent pensions; we do not need arms. The aim of this measure is not about keeping us safe from terrorism. The terrorism is what is going on here. I listened to what the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies said. They believe this is about co-operation and genuine peacekeeping but the reality is that it is about co-operation with NATO and more involvement in spending on the European Defence Fund. Deputy Lisa Chambers and others refuse to see that it is about the creation of a European army. The word "army" means aggression. It means tackling problems with arms, bombs, bullets, guns and heavy machinery. That is something Fine Gael has always supported but our Constitution and our people are clear that we are not aggressors. If we are peacekeepers, we are not being paranoid or hysterical about this. We were painted that way by the Tánaiste this morning, but there is nothing hysterical or paranoid about it. The elite in Europe must be delighted that it is giving us its backing and solidarity on Brexit and that we will support the elite on this destruction and the capacity it will give it to create a big army across Europe. This is about military intervention. We should reflect on the military intervention of the great imperial powers of Europe and what it has done in terms of humanitarianism. At present, we are seeing the re-emergence of slavery in Libya. Europe has a pact with Libya whereby Europe pays it to keep refugees inside Libya. It pays Libya to keep the people who are being held up for sale by marketeers - "Buy this young man. He is a good strong young man and you can bid for him now." It is a return to the heavy old days prior to the American and French revolutions when there were no such things as liberty, equality and fraternity. That is where the population of the world that is fleeing destitution, famine and war is heading, caused in no small measure by military intervention in the past by the French, British and Portuguese when they scrambled for Africa and the Middle East and left a legacy of terrorism behind them. This latest move is being driven by the same interests, particularly of current French and German imperialism. European humanitarian credentials are with the more than 30,000 people drowned in the Mediterranean and those imprisoned in the condemned camps of Libya, Macedonia, Greece and elsewhere. People are being raped, abused, tortured and starved in these camps and we pay for that to happen because we pay those states to keep the people there. Those are our humanitarian credentials. We are jumping from that to spending a pile of money on militarism and saying that we wish to support this European project. We want to back this racist, brutal European project on the basis that PESCO is supposed to be about keeping us safe from terrorism. However, it is about entrapping tens of thousands of people in the most miserable conditions. I will conclude with a comment on the soldiers, sailors and military personnel of this country. They know the reality of serving in the Defence Forces. We have discussed it in the House but they live it. That reality is living on impoverished wages and in bad conditions. Many personnel must rely on family income supplement and many of them had their families outside the gates of Leinster House last week protesting against the poverty wages, the conditions in which they live, the lack of payment for overtime and the closure of barracks which meant they had to move many miles away from their original homes. They do not get travel allowance and many personnel have admitted that they have had to live in their cars because they cannot afford the obnoxious and inflated rents throughout the State. We cannot take our Defence Forces personnel out of poverty and give them decent wages and conditions but, overnight, we can increase our defence budget to support a European aggression project and NATO. Finally, shame on the Minister, the Government and particularly the Independent Alliance Members who are propping up the Government if we are forced to vote on this today. The record of Deputies Finian McGrath and John Halligan is one of being on the side of anti-imperialism, standing with the anti-war movement, opposing troops in Shannon and opposing the type of NATO project which this measure will support. They should think twice before they allow the Government to push ahead with the vote in these circumstances. This requires a great deal of public debate and legislative scrutiny. We want to know if the Attorney General has given the Government advice on the constitutionality of this move. The Government must answer questions before it forces this down the throat of the Irish public.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	We are diving straight into this madness when we have almost zero detail, and nothing official in writing, about what this could mean for Ireland's neutrality. Instead of facts, the briefing document contains vague threats about us playing ball with the EU or else we cannot protect our interests within the Union. This vague language of ultimatum is unhelpful when discussing Ireland taking part in the expansion of the global arms trade. We must have details. What is PESCO and what will it do? The notion that the public has been informed about this because it was an aspect of the Lisbon treaty in 2009 is nonsense. I was in a café this morning and I asked six people who came in whether they knew what PESCO is. They were people who would generally be well informed on most matters but none of them knew what I was talking about. They did not know what PESCO was. It is unbelievable of Fianna Fáil to thank the Government for articulating the position. Perhaps I missed it but I did not hear it mentioned on the "Morning Ireland" programme on the last two mornings. Perhaps it was mentioned, but I do not listen to the full programme. I did not see all the news programme last night but I did not hear it mentioned. Perhaps I missed that as well. Deputy Brendan Ryan pointed out that there were six groups on the Business Committee who wanted this matter postponed until after Christmas. Two did not. This is what new politics is. I had a different interpretation of what new politics is supposed to be but obviously I was wrong. With regard to the details of PESCO, where will the weapons that will be bought with moneys from the fund be used? Will it be investing in weapons and technology to be used against civilians? For a few years now Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Germany have been dropping bombs in Syria. Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, France, Denmark and Belgium all took part in the disastrous military campaign against Libya in 2011 which was one of the maddest wars in history. When we argued about it here, we were told by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that it was a good idea. Whether we like it, we are signing up with a bunch of warmongers. How can we guarantee that PESCO will remain separate from the wars of aggression in which our European neighbours are very fond of being involved? If one reads the multitude of briefing and research documents written by consultants for the defence industry, one will see that they all open with the same lines - "Because of Brexit and the unreliability of Trump to provide Europe with a defence, Europe needs to start taking responsibility for its own defence". That is precisely the rubbish the Taoiseach threw at me yesterday. Let us look at the facts. In the 16 years of never-ending wars of aggression since 2001, when we let it use Shannon Airport in bombing Afghanistan, the United States has done nothing short of destroying huge sections of the Middle East and North Africa, in the process killing between 1 million and 2 million civilians who had no involvement in the war efforts, driving millions more from their homes and radicalising many of those who stayed behind who, in turn, drove out or killed many of those who had stayed behind and refused to be radicalised. It has trained and armed extremist rebel groups at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars and illegally invaded over 100 countries nearly every year for the last ten. That is a fact. In 2015 alone President Obama signed the death warrants of people in 134 countries, people who never saw a courtroom. The United States has expanded the drone programme to terrorise and bomb civilians everywhere it is operational. The United States arms and supports brutal dictators, tells lies about them when it suits and invades their countries, in the process destabilising them in order that everything will descend into chaos. Nothing has changed under President Trump. In fact, the arms industry loves him. The United States sold $42 billion worth of arms to the rest of the world in 2017, up €10 billion on the previous year. Aerospace and defence industry stocks have risen in value by more than 40% since November 2016. The Taoiseach says we do not want to rely on the United States to carry out these war crimes, that the European Union has to start doing it for itself. Do what exactly - emulate the record of the United States? That the European Union needs to start taking responsibility for its defence is nonsense. Last year it spent 1.4% of GDP on defence. This amounts to roughly €200 billion, more than the amount spent by China or Russia, and second only to the amount spent by the United States. It hardly needs to beef up its defence spending. On what, in God's name, are we going to be spending the money when PESCO is fully up and running? Where are we going to use the weapons? Tackling cyber-crime and providing better gear for our peacekeepers will only cost so much. It would be great if we were prepared to put some money into defence. Would it not be great if we actually gave it to those involved in it, the Defence Forces, instead of asking their members to live on a pittance, given that many of them depend on supplements from the State to survive and feed their families? Fianna Fáil has raised the issue, but how can anyone argue that our neutrality is under threat? I will ask Fianna Fáil a question. Let us suppose there is a change of Government after the next general election and it decides to let the Russians use Shannon Airport for military purposes. Would anyone here try to make the argument that we were still neutral? If we were to let the Russians use Shannon Airport for military purposes, would we still be neutral? What do Members think? Would they think we were still neutral? No, they would not. We are letting the US military use Shannon Airport to bomb the homes of people in other regions. We are not neutral and it is total nonsense to say we are. God help us and save us. I do not understand it. In fairness, I give the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, a little credit for being straight because both of them would prefer to be able to say, "No, we are not neutral. We are actually happy to be in the US military's camp. We are two out and out hawks and comfortable with it." However, they have not got there yet and do not yet want to say it because it has not been the language they have been using. They might upset Fianna Fáil which would prefer to pretend until the end of its days that we are neutral.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	Patently, the fact that we are here is not an exercise in democratic scrutiny by the House. It is nothing more than a manoeuvre to avoid effective scrutiny of this measure, not just by this House but also among the broader public. There is no doubt in my mind that this is happening because the political establishment has learned lessons from the last time people were given information - on the Lisbon treaty and so on - therefore, it is better to keep them in the dark. I am so shocked by some of the stuff that has happened this week that I still cannot get my head around it. The Government has valiantly been trying to pitch PESCO as nothing for us to worry about, something Ireland to which can sign up without any impact on our policy of neutrality. That is comforting - not - coming from people who have undermined so much our neutrality. As Deputy Brendan Ryan said, there is no reason this decision could not be delayed. If the Government is so confident that it can stand over the arguments for and answer questions on this issue, why are we ramming it through today? The questions have not been answered - the silence is the answer. The Government tells us that PESCO does not mean that we are joining a European army, despite the fact that in September Mr. Macron specifically called for the establishment of an EU intervention force that would by 2020 give the European Union autonomous capacity to take action. He said that in order to achieve this, a good place to start would be with what the European Union has already approved, a common defence fund and PESCO. While the Government sneers at the fears of some in this House and among the broader public, if they get to hear about it, that this potentially will involve Ireland in a European army, let us not forget that when the Taoiseach met Mr. Macron a few weeks after his bold statements on the creation of a European army, he gave him full support, with defence being specifically mentioned. I was also a little surprised yesterday when the Taoiseach said in answer to Deputy Mick Wallace that he did not do the fudge, "There is nothing to see. Do not worry about it." He actually came out and argued in favour of an EU army in preference to the US army. I certainly do not want to see an EU army. I do not want Irish forces to be involved in one and do not believe most Irish people do either. There is no doubt - Deputies have made this point - that EU member states will commit to increased military spending. PESCO has absolutely been driven by the arms industry. While that should not surprise us, we still have the official line that it does not specifically commit us to sticking to NATO's bottom line of moving towards a figure of 2% of GDP for defence budgets by 2020. However, by committing to closer co-operation, a commitment that will be monitored, we are, in fact, committing to increased defence spending. Some have estimated that Ireland is likely to be handing over more than €1.3 billion by 2021, which is a conservative estimate. It is galling for Defence Forces personnel who are living on a shoestring that we will be able to put our hands on that money when we cannot even offer them decent pay and conditions. It is an outrage. It is the case that the Government is bouncing us into this arrangement by doing it so quickly, without any proper public debate. In The Sunday Times in 2016 Conor Brady sketched it rather well when he said, in talking about closer EU defence co-operation, that our politicians, as well as the military top brass, senior civil servants and diplomats, agreed with it but that it would be political suicide for any of them to make a full assault on Irish neutrality.He concluded:A policy of low-level, pragmatic collaboration with our EU partners in the building of defence capability is probably the best option. We could still argue that we are not, strictly speaking, part of the EU defence arrangements. It would be hypocritical, but we have no great reputation for straight-talking anyway.That was prophetic and summed up exactly the approach being taken by this Government of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, ably backed up by their Independent Alliance colleagues. For the Government to perform an end run around not just the national Parliament, but also the public, whose money will be shovelled into this abomination, whose bodies will be the fodder in the cannons of an EU army and who are Deputies' ultimate bosses, is unprecedented. When I first raised this matter at the Business Committee in November after it was mentioned at the European Council, we were assured that full democratic procedures would be followed, but that is not what has happened. Despite the fact that other Deputies have tabled Topical Issue matters and so on to try to raise the issue, there was no mention of it when we attended the Business Committee last week. Neither was there any mention of it being discussed this week or next week until it was shoehorned into the agenda earlier this week. That is unprecedented. Without doubt, this will be viewed in time as one of the most treacherous decisions that the House has ever taken. Why are we doing it? A scenario has been created wherein by taking this course of action we are saving and protecting ourselves from the terrorists and marauding hordes that are suddenly on our border. Deputy Lisa Chambers tells us that we need to engage in surveillance, but surveillance of whom? Whose world is this making safer? The past decade has been the most militarised in history, yet there are more wars in more places now than ever before. If people want to make the world safe against terrorism, they should stop interfering in countries and destroying the lives of people who are then driven into terrorism as a so-called solution. To militarise our borders in order to keep out the victims of those crises or put surveillance on them is a disgrace. If the Government was serious about combating terrorism and protecting the citizens of this State, it would immediately end the use of Shannon Airport by the US military and end the hypocrisy of claiming to be militarily neutral while bending the knee to the US establishment, the EU, which is our friend in terms of Brexit, and to their bosses, the arms industry, which is driving this situation for its own profit and to the detriment of humanity.

It runs contrary to Ireland's tradition as a neutral non-aligned country and it will not serve our people or armed forces well in the great work that the latter have done representing us in peace missions overseas. We regret that the process by which approval is being sought - at incredibly short notice and without proper debate or committee hearings at which we could have real consultation - casts a shadow on what is being done. Regardless, we disagree in principle with the approach that is being taken. While we recognise that we need to train and better resource our military and ensure that it has joint operability with the militaries of other countries on peacekeeping missions, our contention, having read the notification on PESCO and the founding documents that have been set out, is that this goes far beyond that. This is about the building up of a military capability and industrial armaments capability, which will not provide security in the long run. From the documents, it is clear that PESCO is primarily focused on the security issue that people perceive in our relationship with bordering areas, particularly with north Africa in the south, the Middle East and so on, where there are increasing tensions and difficulties. Any assessment of what has been done by European nations and others in recent years would show that the approach that has been taken is not working. In fact, it has increased the level of insecurity and threat rather than decreased it. The example of Libya has been mentioned a number of times. European governments, primarily Britain and France, engaged in a regime change operation, ostensibly to create a more secure state, but left that state in complete anarchy. There has been considerable conflict in Libya as well as conditions of slavery applying to migrant peoples who are locked in that country. There has been a breakdown of order. The approach of using heavy military equipment - armaments, aircraft and so on - to try to enforce a peace simply does not work. When speaking with a friend who had been working at a high level in Afghanistan for the past ten years and was in regular contact with American generals there, I asked her about their sense of how that approach had gone. She told me that most of those generals would honestly admit that, if given the choice, they would employ 1,000 aid workers before they would ever deploy a military division and that the old method of applying force through the use of large armaments in an attempt to keep the peace did not work. It has not been our way in our successful peacekeeping operations. The Government regularly says that PESCO is about peacekeeping and increasing our ability to engage in such missions, but the rationale for PESCO as set out in the documents is the opposite. The notification documents read: "The project portfolio shall reflect an appropriate balance between projects which are more in the area of capability development and those who are more in the area of operations and missions". The Minister stated that the 2% target only related to research expenditure, but there is a clear commitment that any government partaking in the process will ensure that its expenditure on what is called "defence investment", which I take to mean the development of an armaments capability, which is involved in a military form of peacekeeping that will not work, will increase to 20% of total expenditure over successive years. People have claimed that this is not a move towards the further development of NATO, but I will refer Members who may be considering voting in favour of the motion to the speech given by President Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, in his state of the European Union address, where he was again categoric and explicit on the need to develop a European defence union and that this would be in NATO's interests. Time and again, the Secretary General of NATO welcomed the introduction of PESCO. All parties are saying that this is effectively Europe stepping in to replace or complement NATO in order to provide our main security-peacekeeping system. That approach will not work and is not our approach as a country, given our historical position of non-aligned neutrality. That may seem abstract or difficult to measure in terms of what value it brings, but the Irish people know it and treasure it, and when they find out after the fact that we have taken this strategic decision, they will say that it is not the way that we should have gone. While we need to build up the Defence Forces and ensure that our soldiers, sailors and air personnel are better paid and have the right equipment, none of that means that we have to make this commitment. Denmark is an example of a similar country that has gone in a different direction. No Deputy has said that Denmark is terrible or failing to live up to its European commitments. It maintains its strength by having a certain independence.The European Union would be stronger by having a certain level of diversity in terms of its approach to security and defence issues, in particular. Europe has a history which we cannot ignore or avoid. It has been one of military adventurism, in particular in North Africa, the Middle East and border areas. What guarantees do we have that the tradition we are committing to, in terms of the ramping up of expenditure on armament and capabilities, will not be one which dominates in this new mechanism? I am very much a supporter of the European Union and I am glad we are a member state. I believe this is a time where we have to have multilateral co-operation and be a leading player in moving the Union forward. However, I do not want to see that happening in the area of defence spending and militarisation. What Europe brings to the world is a more diplomatic and political, less offensive, process. Ireland, as an independent, neutral and non-aligned country, could be a voice on the edge of Europe calling out on a regular basis to say, "Not in this way". I am constrained by time, given that I am sharing time with Deputy Healy. We are rushing this through and it appears that Fianna Fáil will agree to the motion. I would like the Government to commit to full transparency on all expenditure, decisions and information on which projects Ireland will become involved in and that the Dáil is informed on a regular basis about what is happening. The process should not be hidden and decisions made in corridors in Brussels which we know nothing about. It would be a tragedy and mistake for us to sign up to this today, but let us at least make sure that the Dáil has full transparency and accountability in regard to what is unfortunately happening in our name.

It is very clear that there is an attempt to bulldoze this through the Oireachtas and bounce us into PESCO, which is effectively a militarised Europe. This issue was initially raised on 14 November. It was cleared by the Cabinet on 21 November. However, it was never raised at the Business Committee which sets the agenda for the House, usually two weeks in advance. There was no indication of the matter on the agenda of the Business Committee either on a current week basis or for the following week. On Monday last, we found that we would have two hours to debate this proposal. It is clearly an attempt to bounce us into what is effectively a European army. There should be proper discussion in the House. It should have been referred to the defence committee where a proper discussion, rather than a tick box exercise as we had yesterday, could take place. The committee would have an opportunity to bring all interested parties before it and hear all of their views. It could have sought public submissions and heard from interest groups like the Army, the Irish Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, Afri and other organisations and individuals that have an interest in this area. This is an issue not just for the Oireachtas but also the public. There has been no public debate on or scrutiny of this issue. There has been an attempt to bring this in under the wire and get it through the House quickly. The Government has an opportunity to withdraw the proposal and send it to the Citizens' Assembly, which could discuss it properly. The public could have an opportunity to discuss and scrutinise the proposal. We have heard there is a deadline. It is very clear from the response of the Minister of State on this issue that there is no deadline and that the so-called deadline has more to do with Brexit and the support of the EU for the Irish position. I again call on the Government to withdraw this proposal and allow time for the Oireachtas and the public more generally, including the Citizens' Assembly, to deal with this issue. It is quite clear from all the documentation that, far from what Deputy Chambers said, PESCO is a binding enhanced defence pact. It is not voluntary or temporary. It is a permanent arrangement and a huge step towards a militarised European Union and European army. We know where that has brought us. There has been chaos in Libya following the interventions of various governments. There are three different governments and vast areas of the country have no government at all. There are various detention centres, some of which are under the control of one or other of the three different governments, while others are under the control of individual militias. The conditions are horrendous and people are being abused, sold as slaves etc. Those fleeing Libya are being intercepted by EU boats, which unfortunately include Irish ships, and handed back to the Italian Navy which then sends them to one of the pro-European government centres in Libya. They return to horrendous conditions. Millions of people left our shores during the Famine years and afterwards. They found safety and security across the world. Surely people fleeing Libya are entitled to the same. We are definitely moving towards a common defence pact. As other speakers have said, there is no doubt that is a breach Article 29 of Bunreacht na hÉireann. Has the Government received legal advice from the Attorney General on the issue? The costs involved are another very serious issue for the public. On an annual basis, they will total approximately €1.5 billion, which is five times what we already spend. That is money which could easily go to other areas. The main part of that expenditure will benefit the arms industry. We have already purchased a number of ships at a cost of €75 million each. We have a tender for a ship costing €250 million. The arms industry will benefit from that type of expenditure. Money should instead go towards dealing with the various emergencies in our country, such as housing. Some 8,500 people are homeless and 3,500 children will wake up on Christmas morning in hotel bedrooms and bed breakfast accommodation. I call on the Ministers of State, Deputies Finian McGrath and John Halligan, to make their position on this known. They have a record of opposing the militarisation of the EU and a European army. It is incumbent on them to make their position clear before the vote takes place. I am shocked by the intervention and support of Fianna Fáil for this proposal. Eamon de Valera would turn in his grave.

When I was young we fed the hens presto. When I heard PESCO discussed at the Business Committee I thought the reference was to presto. PESCO is Permanent Structured Cooperation.Nothing is simple or laissez-faire about this. It is a permanent process. The Government is pulling a fast one. The Ceann Comhairle chairs the Business Committee and I respect the great job he does both there and in the House. I wish him a happy Christmas. There were three Business Committee meetings about this. As has been stated by many others, there was no mention of it until recently. It was approved by the Cabinet on 15 November. The Rural Independent Group will bring a motion before the House next Tuesday night at 9 p.m. and we have to give at least two if not three weeks' notice of our intentions or what we will debate. That is only right. The Government, on the other hand, can come here to pull this out of a lucky bag when it is nearly Christmas week. It tells us it will be grand and hopes we will be distracted with everything on Grafton Street and a feeling of being jolly and merry so we will approve the motion. It is underhanded, deceitful and disrespectful to the House, its Members and all the people. It is the first time since the formation of the Business Committee in this Dáil that a majority opposed Government business. We have been co-operative and we work together to try to organise business and get legislation passed. Often, we do our best in a hurry. I am a member of the Business Committee and this has been bulldozed through. We thought we might have the start of an election campaign last week so what would have happened then? There would have been no PESCO or pesto or anything else; we would have been knocking on doors looking for pesto or some bit of sustenance from households to keep us going. Perhaps a bowl of porridge or hot soup, for example. Where would it have been then? If it is so important to approve this before the December deadline, what would have happened if the House was imithe? We would not be discussing it at all. Much pressure is being applied, along with underhanded work I do not like. I fully support our Army and its proud record over decades. We had a very fine barracks in Clonmel but the Government took that away from us too. We kept Cromwell out of Clonmel but we could not keep out big Phil and the Fine Gael gang. They destroyed the place by taking the corporation and the barracks out of it. They took mental health facilities out of it. Defence Forces personnel are now dispersed over the country with no travelling expenses. Last week we had a debate watched by the wives and partners, fathers and mothers, uncles, aunts, sons and nephews of Defence Forces personnel. They are proud people and are being reduced to penury. They are in receipt of family income supplement, not able to put food on the table for their kids. We saw an exposé on RTÉ about this. It would be better for the Government to support the Army we have and treat it with respect. We go on television praising the work done by the Army and Irish Navy on humanitarian missions in the Middle East and other areas. It is very important we recognise it but we cannot have it on the cheap or a shoestring. We must support the personnel and give them proper training, equipment and, above all, a decent wage so they can raise their family with some modicum of dignity and ease rather than scrounging from one week to the next. I do not see many television programmes but I saw this one and it was harrowing to see wives trying to manage until the next paycheque and get support from families. We need to put our money where our mouth is and support the Army rather than have it linked to something like this. We do not know the parameters of this PESCO process. I do not like it anyway. Deputy Lisa Chambers has gone but as I said last week, she might as well be sitting where the Minister of State is because she was more passionate about this than he was. She told us about it last week and today. She can spare me the lecture as I do not need a lecture from Deputy Chambers or anybody else, saying we are anti-this or anti-that and we do not support our Army. We do, of course, and we want it to be supported, respected and paid. We do not wish to be led, blindfolded, into a position in which we should not be. We have the name of a neutral country and I want to keep it. I am also questioning the use of Shannon Airport, certainly when it comes to soldiers passing through. We are told the American soldiers going to Afghanistan and the Middle East are unarmed when they go through Shannon Airport but there are other shipments. If the Minister - the Taoiseach, in this case - was here he could tell us how many aircraft with armaments have passed through our State. I was in the right place at the right time and saw letters that needed to be signed to agree passage of a number of planes with deadly munitions that create havoc. There is no accountability to the House for that either. This started back with the Lisbon treaty. I will put my hand up and say that like an eejit, I was a member of the great party that voted for the treaty. I campaigned the first time but not the second time. We saw the trouble that British people have with Brexit. They did not reject the view of the people and they are trying to deal with it. We are dealing with those consequences. We went back and fooled the people. It was a question of kid me twice and catch the people a second time. That is what happened. We had a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, which was the genesis of this process of undermining our neutrality. It took control from our people and sovereign Parliament. It is a while ago and I suppose we should have seen alarm bells ringing then. I was not a Deputy then but I was cannon fodder in a political party when one shuts up and does what one is told. The task was to admire the great leader and accept the whip. I am thankful I have been unshackled and I have the best freedom of my life. I can speak as and when I wish on whatever topics I choose. Most important, I can vote as I wish rather than getting an instruction from the Whip, with a call to the office if I vote the wrong way or miss a vote. It is a great feeling of energy, enthusiasm and vibrancy, if anybody is thinking of it. I can do as I like. I serve one master, which is me, as well as the public.

I speak with him every day and he supports and sustains me, thank God. I have no masters in the political hierarchy telling me to do this or that. Mention has been made of the Ministers of State, Deputies Halligan and Finian McGrath. They are like spinning tops now because they have spun so much from the policies they stood for when I knew them. When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was on this side of the House he was very angry about these matters. I remember being at the American ambassador's residence for lunch one day when we were not long here and he spoke about Nicaragua and the other places where the Americans should not have been. It is amazing how one loses one's conscience when one joins the ranks of the Ministers of State. It is lost completely or sold, one or the other. That is what happened. This matter is unpalatable. There are no guidelines and the costs, which have been mentioned, are put at up to €1.5 billion per year. The money could be spent well in upgrading our barracks and equipment, as well as soldiers' pay. When we have a flood, snow or any kind of emergency, they are the first line of defence. They are the first line of defence to support An Garda Síochána when there is trouble as well. We could do it much better. The Government has been caught with its pants down on this as it did not expect resistance at the Business Committee and here in the Dáil. With its allies in Fianna Fáil-----

We were pretty jumpy two weeks ago and we thought the water pipe had burst and was severed forever but the supply has been mended for the moment. The frost is coming and it could freeze the water and the pipe could easily shatter. We could be out knocking on doors in the few weeks after Christmas but the Government would be happy enough to have signed up to PESCO. We will be the good boys of Europe again. Where were our friends in Europe when we wanted them during the so-called bailout? They allowed European banks to shovel billions of euro into the country. It was secured but the insurance was never drawn down. The Irish people had to take the rap. They then gave us a bailout, which I called a clean-out. They charged us nearly 6% interest on the money when we got it from the International Monetary Fund for less than 3%. We are still repaying that debt but money can be borrowed now on the world markets for less than 1%. Where are our friends in that respect? We needed those friends but they were nowhere. We got lectures, as did the British people after Brexit. These people forget that we are meant to be autonomous states and we will do as we wish. We respect the wishes of our electorate. The noise and soundings from President Donald Tusk and others since Brexit have led us to our current impasse. They should be a bit more conciliatory and respectful of the fact that we have our independence, which was hard-fought, and we want to maintain it. It is not about linking to rag-tag coalitions with deadly intentions and that carry out acts of war. Deputy Chambers and others spoke about surveillance.I, too, have concerns about some of the people coming into the country, but we cannot close our borders to those who find themselves in unfortunate circumstances. I have visited Lebanon and met the refugees there. I saw plenty of old women and young children but no men because they had either been slaughtered, were in hiding or had gone off to join ISIS or some other group. We cannot reject the people in question in their time of need. During the Great Famine Irish people arriving on famine ships were received in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. We must have a more in-depth and thorough examination of what is causing the crises in these strife-ridden areas. Much of it is a consequence of actions taken by the armaments industries in large countries. The Americans and others who went into Syria in an attempt to get rid of President al-Assad and establish a new regime are the same people who supplied the guys on the other side with guns and equipment. It is a daylight con job, with desperate implications for the people of Syria. We must show humanity, respect and compassion. Above all, we must maintain our neutrality. A previous speaker referred to Eamon de Valera who surely must be spinning in his grave. We all know the approach he took in the Second World War. Now, however, we are, apparently, happy to sign up to everything that is put in front of us. When we are told to jump, we ask, "How high?" and sign the papers, for which we receive a pat on the back and perhaps a meal and a celebration. The Irish are the good boys of Europe, but where are our thanks for it? I will not say the word I would like to use to describe the thanks we get, but it starts with an "S". We are proposing to put our soldiers into unknown territories, possibly without proper equipment. Soldiers who participated in a previous United Nations mission were rightly honoured in Galway last week. It took 60 years to have their contribution recognised. We are now facing a situation where Irish soldiers will be sent into conflict zones without proper training and knowledge and without adequate support for their families at home. I am all for ensuring the Army, the FCA and the Reserve Defence Force are properly equipped, trained and clothed and given adequate remuneration for their service to the country and the United Nations. The Defence Forces enjoy worldwide respect for the service they have given in many locations. However, the more we get sucked into these quangos or outfits, the less respect there will be for our forces and neutral position. We must go back to the drawing board on this proposal. The Taoiseach is not in the Chamber, but I ask him to withdraw the motion before it is put to a vote. I appeal to the erstwhile colleague sitting to my right, Deputy Seán Haughey, that his party reconsider its position, having regard to its roots and the struggles of its founder.

They should be more than just a mudguard for the Fine Gael-led Government. Mudguards collect dirt and often fall off, are driven over and wrecked. We must have proper consultation and a proper debate on this proposal. A previous speaker referred to the Citizens' Assembly, but we have had enough of that for now. This House is the real citizens' assembly and we must have a proper debate here and at the committee. Instead of presenting us with a simplistic fact sheet, the Government must allow us to debate the real facts. Deputy Lisa Chambers advised us to inform ourselves better on these matters. I do not know how we managed before she came into the House. She wants to lecture us and set the bar for the lesser people, but I will not take lessons from her on this issue. I look forward to having a proper debate on it.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	I commend the motion to approve Ireland's participation in the European Union's permanent structured cooperation framework, PESCO. I missed the beginning of the debate because I was at a committee, but I could make a fair stab at guessing some of the points raised and the scaremongering which I expect has come from the Opposition benches. It is important to set out the facts clearly when considering the motion. PESCO will ultimately enhance the capability of UN-mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping and conflict prevention and the strengthening of our international security. When one considers the fantastic reputation of Ireland's Defence Forces internationally and the amazing peacekeeping work they do, approving this proposal makes perfect sense. We must bear in mind the many threats we face at this time. We have a tendency to feel secure in neutral Ireland, but the reality is that there are threats all over the world that could manifestly impact on us. Most of these risks cannot be faced down by a single country acting alone, particularly not a country of this size. If we take, for example, the threat of cyberterrorsim, there has been a huge increase in cyberhacking and a sense that a great deal of it is coming from Russia and a number of other countries. Computers fly aeroplanes, run transport systems and operate banks and hospitals. An attack on these computer systems could see all of our services grinding to a halt. When we see cyberhacking activities linked with the countries I mentioned, it is clear that we need a positive and proactive plan to address them. I want to see the European Union of which this country is part taking a co-ordinated approach to this issue and Ireland at the heart of it. One of the projects we will consider participating in if we do join PESCO involves tackling cyberthreats and devising an incident response information-sharing platform. It makes perfect sense for us to engage actively with our EU partners in this important area. Joining PESCO will be good for the Defence Forces. The Tánaiste was very clear earlier that there was absolutely no obligation under PESCO to increase our defence expenditure to 2% of GDP. Having said that, I want to see increased investment in the Defence Forces in the future, not just in equipment and infrastructure but also in personnel. Members saw a significant reduction in their allowances late in the past decade. If we are to continue to attract and retain the best people, we must move to reinstate these allowances.  Another project in which we might consider participating, under the PESCO framework, involves the establishment of a centre of excellence for EU military training missions. In fact, not only should we look to participate in that initiative, we should also seek to host the training. The 2015 White Paper on Defence outlined an ambitious plan to develop a peace and leadership institute in the Curragh Camp, which would help to build our international reputation as a world leader in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. I hope our joining PESCO will lead to the advancement of that proposal. It would involve the development of a state-of-the-art institute of international standing to which non-governmental organisations and politicians from all over the world could come to study peace enforcement and conflict resolution strategies. That type of investment would not only enhance our international reputation but also create significant employment in south Kildare and attract substantial investment into the area. A previous speaker on the other side of the House expressed the view that the PESCO initiative was being driven by the armaments industry. I was at a meeting in Brussels last Monday of the chairs of national European People's Party parties, at which concern was expressed that the main opposition to PESCO would come from the arms industry because, in fact, the agreement did not suit it at all. After all, one of the objectives is to encourage the sharing of equipment by member states. Countries in Europe which currently spend a great deal of money on defence are doing so individually, without talking to others. The sharing of equipment would see lower purchase volumes and a more strategic and smarter approach to purchases made. To clarify, the view among member states is that one of the main threats to PESCO will come in the form of an attempt by the arms industry to undermine it by way of some of the scaremongering arguments we have heard from Opposition Members. I have more to say, but I am almost out of time. Participation in PESCO will fully respect the constitutional provisions of all member states.It does not affect our military neutrality in any way. The triple lock still holds such that if Ireland is to engage in any peacekeeping activity it must have a United Nations Security Council resolution or mandate, a Government decision and Dáil approval. There is nothing to fear from PESCO. It provides a good opportunity for our Defence Forces and I commend the motion to the House.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	The EU has been the biggest peace process attempted in recent history. It has ensured peace, stability and progress in Europe since the Second World War. We need to put this debate in context and consider our overall commitment to the European Union. Brexit is the biggest issue facing this country. There is to be a major summit of the European Council next week. We need to recognise the firm support of the heads of the other EU states for Ireland's position. We hope there will be a successful outcome from the Irish point of view from that meeting. A debate is under way on the future of Europe. The Commission has put forward five options and President Macron of France has made a speech and Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission President, gave a state of the union address. Some say there is a lack of debate but there is a public consultation process about the future of the European Union and everybody needs to get involved in that. We need to state that Ireland remains a fully committed member of the EU and wants to be central to the debate on the future of the EU.  Non-governmental organisations have put forward a sixth option which emphasises environmental and social issues. Ireland should give serious consideration to that. The UK leaving the EU has brought the Franco-German access to the fore again. President Macron has outlined his vision for the future of Europe. He called for a more sovereign, unified and democratic EU and for the re-foundation of Europe. He called for several other measures too. As a small nation state we do not agree with all of those but we should have the confidence to play our part in this debate in the interests of our common future. I am a firm believer in Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality which is not just the avoidance of military alliances but the promotion of peace, justice and basic human rights. We are respected for that. Our UN mandate with regard to peacekeeping and peace enforcement is very well respected. We were not colonisers. The developing countries in particular recognise our position which allows us to punch above our weight in global affairs. Reference has been made to Eamon de Valera turning in his grave at the position of the Fianna Fáil Party on this motion but things change and evolve. I wonder what view Seán Lemass would have taken of this issue. He was a pragmatic patriot and I think he is on the record as saying we need to move in this area from the European perspective. That should be recognised too. PESCO was provided for in the Lisbon treaty of 2009 which Ireland ratified. New issues have emerged such as human trafficking, terrorism and cybercrime. We need to co-operate with fellow EU states on these issues. PESCO projects will include peacekeeping operations under the EU flag. All projects are voluntary. Ireland can opt in or opt out. We can take a pragmatic approach to PESCO. It will operate on the basis that the specific character of the security and defence policy of all our member states is taken into account. It is also interesting to note that three other EU neutral states have signed up to PESCO, Sweden, Austria and Finland. Many years ago at Trinity College I did a thesis on Irish neutrality. Many of these neutral countries believe in an armed neutrality. They support their neutrality by expenditure on defence and believe in the necessity of armed neutrality.  There is concern about the increase in military spending but this was provided for in the defence White Paper. We need to increase pay and replace equipment in our Defence Forces and PESCO will give us an opportunity to do much of that. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	PESCO is the beginning of the creation of a standing EU army. At the press conference after PESCO was agreed Federica Mogherini said:[W]e are building the European Union of Security and Defence. It is not a plan anymore, it is not a dream anymore, it is reality coming true.It is disgraceful that this Government and its partners in Fianna Fáil have once again tried to sneak a motion through this House quickly and quietly in order to undermine Ireland's neutrality. It is obvious why it is doing this. Neutrality is popular in Ireland. It wants to undermine and destroy it but will not do so in the open because people would not stand for it. It is shameful that the Independent Alliance Deputies, who for years in opposition spoke passionately in favour of Irish neutrality and repeatedly supported Sinn Féin's attempts to have a referendum to enshrine neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann, now do not have the courage to stand in favour of neutrality and vote against this at Cabinet or in the Dáil. They want to lock us into an EU defence union which will involve massively increased arms spending and overseas interventions and package it as some benign agreement. Yesterday, we spoke here about neurological services and the problems facing that sector and our health service yet today we are talking about spending money on foreign intervention and an EU army. It looks ridiculous to the public outside here.  Sinn Féin has repeatedly spoken out against the further militarisation of the EU and the creation of this EU army. We opposed it at every step. We were repeatedly labelled as scaremongers and fantasists. During the Lisbon treaty campaign Sinn Féin and others on the "No" side pointed out that accepting the treaty would lead to the creation of an EU army. One of the major reasons that the Irish people rejected the Lisbon treaty the first time was concern for Irish neutrality. We were then told we misled the public and Fianna Fáil, with Fine Gael and the Labour Party's support, ran the referendum again but this time with a supposed promise from the EU that Ireland's neutrality would be respected. We were also repeatedly told an EU army would not be created, that it was a fallacy and would not happen. Once again, Sinn Féin has been proved right in its criticism of the EU and the establishment parties' desire to join an EU army are being laid bare for all to see. During the short debate yesterday the Taoiseach said this is not a new issue, it is the Lisbon treaty. This is part of a long line of actions by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party to dismantle Irish neutrality. In 1997, the Fianna Fáil-led Government signed Ireland up to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO's, Partnership for Peace despite promises to the contrary, and a pre-election promise that it would call a referendum on this issue. Who heads NATO? Who drives it? The Americans. Donald Trump. Where are we going with all this? The same parties, when in power between 2002 and 2004, involved this State in supporting an illegal invasion of Iraq based on concocted evidence. In 2003 alone, they allowed more than 3,500 military aircraft to overfly Irish airspace and well over 125,000 US troops to use Shannon Airport as a pit-stop on their way to wage war through invasion and occupation of other parts of the world. They repeatedly denied this was so and refused to put any decision before the Dáil until it was too late. Between 2002 and 2011 it is estimated that over 2.2 million US troops passed through Shannon Airport. If the Dáil votes in favour of PESCO here today this will not be over because the people will have to have their say at some stage. Sinn Féin will campaign in the next election on the promise of holding a referendum on enshrining neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann, removing Ireland from PESCO and the NATO Partnership for Peace.I often look at clips on television and see troops passing through Shannon Airport. President Trump's troops are passing through Ireland, yet the vast majority of Irish people stand in opposition to everything he represents and everything those soldiers do. It is evident to anyone with an ounce of common sense that this is wrong and moving in the wrong direction. I suggest the Government needs to rethink as the vast majority of people are in a different space. It is regrettable that Fianna Fáil is also in the same place as the Government. At the end of the day, when all is said and done, we all want a peaceful, democratic society. We are all talking about the threats from abroad, including the threat of terrorism. Our actions and what we are allowing to happen at Shannon Airport represent the biggest threat to our peace. If we join PESCO, it will increase our vulnerability.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	288	The President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, said on 10 November 2016, "We have to do this ourselves, which is why we need a new approach to building a European security union with the end goal of establishing a European army." That is his stated aim. He is in favour of having a European army. PESCO represents a major step towards achieving that goal and, scandalously, the Government has tried and is still trying under the cover of darkness to have Ireland participate in such a European army, making even more of a mockery of our supposed neutrality, considering the use of Shannon Airport. The Government came back to state there was nothing to worry about, that it was about cyber security, that the arms industry would not want this arrangement, that it was not about having a European army and that there was no requirement to spend more money. The Government and the public should read in black and white the Notification on Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) to the Council and to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy which will include Ireland if the motion is passed. It states, "PESCO is an ambitious, binding and inclusive European legal framework for investments in the security and defence of the EU’s territory and its citizens". It continues, "A long term vision of PESCO could be to arrive at a coherent full spectrum force package". "Full-spectrum force package" means that it includes land, air and naval forces. It continues:Based on the collective benchmarks identified in 2007, participating Member States subscribe to the following commitments:1. Regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, in order to reach agreed objectives.There it is in black and white, but the Government refuses to answer. It is not even as vague as it appears with the words "agreed objectives". In reality, the agreed objective and goal will involve the expenditure of 2% of GDP as outlined in NATO and as was outlined in a resolution of the European Parliament on PESCO. That will mean a massive expansion in so-called Irish defence spending. It will mean increasing it from approximately €900 million to €3.6 billion. That is what the Government is signing the country up to when it could do other things with that public money. It could instead build 24,000 houses to resolve the housing crisis, employ 116,000 child care workers, cover the expenditure necessary to begin to implement a national health service, provide for free education, repeal the FEMPI legislatin and provide for pay equality, etc. These are the choices the Government is choosing to make.  The point Deputy Martin Heydon made that the European defence industry did not want this arrangement because it goes against its interests is utter nonsense. The reality is that more money will be spent, which is what the defence industry wants. It will end up with the pedlars of death that have been lobbying extensively and doubled the amount spent on lobbying. The top ten companies in the arms industry increased spending from €2.8 million to €5.6 million in the last year. They have had 36 meetings with the European Commission in the past four years and the end result is that PESCO, together with the European defence fund, will be worth €5 billion a year. In carrying out research for this debate I went to organisations such as Shannonwatch which plays an important role in monitoring the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. I also went to the Irish Anti-War Movement. People should check this on their phones and computers. If one tries to access either website inside Leinster House, one will be blocked on the grounds that they are advocacy organisations. One can log onto the websites of NATO, the US Government and the European Movement, but one cannot visit the websites of the Irish Anti-War Movement and Shannonwatch, which is bizarre. It is clear that there is tension within the European Union between different member states and that there is a drive among some to have greater independence from NATO in the context of the crisis caused by President Trump and the move towards having a European army. We should draw on the words of James Connolly and the statement, "We serve neither King nor Kaiser," and say "neither NATO nor a militarised European Union". Instead, we should have a socialist Ireland and a socialist Europe built on a policy of peace, solidarity and democracy.

I was demonised at the time, as was a small group of others, but we stood together. The President who was a Deputy at the time actively promoted the Lisbon treaty. In that context, I welcome the speech made today by the Labour Party Deputy on his approach to this issue. I mention this because the Taoiseach told us, in one of the documents I have before me, that this had all been decided in the Lisbon treaty and that we had had plenty of time since to discuss it. Perhaps the Minister of State might comment on this. The Taoiseach has told us that this was done and dusted in the Lisbon treaty in 2009. That is an extremely worrying statement. Various people have been quoted, including Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker who clearly indicated a will and a desire to push for a European army, yet at the same time the Lisbon treaty, in article 10(3), that "Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen". The Minister of State might reflect on that article and tell us how the Government has complied with it in the PESCO arrangement that is being rushed through the Dáil, regrettably with the support of Fianna Fáil. What document has been given to us outlining what the Government is signing up to, what it is opting into and what it is opting out of? I relied on my own research and organisations on the ground which I thank for all of their work which is done on a voluntary basis.  I have looked at the notification on the permanent structured cooperation, PESCO, arrangement. Has the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Kyne, or Deputy Alan Farrell read any of it? I have read it and it does not make for pleasant reading. It is ten pages long and some of it has been quoted. I will quote some more from it. It reads: "Based on the collective benchmarks identified in 2007..." I do not have time to read the rest of it as I only have two minutes left. It also states, "Aiming for fast-tracked political commitment at national level, including possibly reviewing their national decision-making procedures". It refers to increasing the share of expenditure on defence, which is spelled out in black and white. Did the Government read the document? Is that what we are signing up to or are we opting into what is outlined on page 2 and opting out of what is stated on page 3? What are we doing? I would have thought my ex-colleague in Fianna Fáil would have at least raised questions about the process. What are we signing up to? Who has seen the document and when will we see it? Will we see it after the decision is made next week? We have not been told why there is such a rush to make the decision. Why does it have to be made this week? Cén fáth é sin? An bhfuil a fhios ag an gCathaoirleach? An bhfuil a fhios ag éinne sa Dáil? Why does it have to be made by next week without any information being placed before us? We have had a contemptuous level of argument from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade this morning who referred to hysterical and exaggerated responses and said we should go and educate ourselves and that we had had plenty of time to do so.Really? This instrument, which the Government will sign next week, will have the most serious implication and this in a country where nine people have been found dead on our streets since August. There is no hesitation in committing millions - the figures have been quoted and it is like Monopoly money - to increase our spending to encourage an industrial military complex and the arms industry, and all in the guise of peace enforcement. The Government has turned language on its head. I think it has forgotten the difference between right and wrong. It has utterly forgotten the difference between the truth and a lie. It insults the people of Ireland who have in various polls repeatedly told us that they hold the concept of neutrality dearly and do not want it abandoned. If it is to be abandoned, let us do it in a truthful way with knowledge to everyone. How dare the Government treat the people of Ireland like this?
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	As respectfully as I can, I will debunk some of the remarks made about the statements of Jean Claude Juncker on the establishment of a European army. I do not need to remind the Members, as they have already made statements to this effect, that we are a neutral country, are not aligned and make decisions based on the triple lock which involves this House, the UN and the Cabinet. Therefore, there is no question as to our participation in any of it. Members of the European Union of other states can have all of the aspirations they wish but the bottom line is that this country has the triple lock. We are neutral and will not be engaging in any such provisions, whether they come into fruition or not. The point about PESCO is that we have options. We can choose to opt into certain elements of the provisions contained within it. The underlying factor and the most important part is that we can share resources with other nations that are taking part in UN mandated missions. I was a member of the defence committee in the previous Dáil. Unlike the Ceann Comhairle, I do not have any barracks in my constituency but they are pretty close by. I am very proud of the work the men and women of our Defence Forces do, particularly in UN mandated missions. They have saved hundreds of thousands of lives of men, women and children. For a very small country off the coast of Europe, we have had an enormous impact for decades and we will continue to have an enormous impact into the future in our participation in peacekeeping missions across the world. As I said, and I want to reiterate it, I am very proud of the men and women of our Defence Forces who put their lives on the line for others to bring forward our concept of democracy and our concept of the defence of the defenceless. I think that is extremely important.  I want to briefly reference the Lisbon Treaty and the fact that it was passed in 2009, when 60% of the electorate voted and 67% of those voted it through. The previous year, only 53% showed up and there was a marginal "No" vote of 53% to 46%. The reason I raise the point is that it was an horrifically run campaign and there was a chronic lack of information. The scaremongering during the campaign was quite extraordinary. I am pleased to say that sense prevailed in terms of the provisions in and protocols to the Lisbon Treaty and the provisions within our Constitution. These are guaranteed. It is not a matter for an outside institution or body to determine what we as a State do. We make those decisions for ourselves. The element of PESCO that I want to dwell upon is the fact that we, as a State, and our Defence Forces can learn and share resources with other states in the engagement in UN missions. That is an extremely important facet of PESCO, primarily on the basis that we will save money. As mentioned earlier by my colleague, Deputy Heydon, we do not have to go out and, for instance, do all of the research and studies that will, no doubt, cost millions of euros in terms of shared services and logistics and, most importantly, the cybersecurity threat, which is enormous. We have our own counter-cyberterrorism agency within the Defence Forces but we can and should learn from other nations which have invested millions, if not billions, of euro in the furtherance of that research and defence. Unfortunately, as a State, we have underinvested chronically in our Defence Forces. It is not just a matter of pay but a matter of conditions and equipment. Deputy McGrath stated that we would be spending an additional €1.5 million per annum. However, if we did not sign up to PESCO and did not participate in exchange of information and knowledge, we would probably have to spend twice or even three times that participating in mandated missions. In the few seconds I have left, I compliment Deputy Lisa Chambers for her contribution and, in particular, her reference to the need for an ongoing debate in this Chamber on what our Defence Forces do. There is a complete, utter and abject ignorance of the precise nature of what they do. I welcome her suggestion of having a three-monthly review and debate about it in this Chamber. It is an important part of what we do in this House. I, too, like my colleague and the Minister commend the motion to the House.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	The Minister came into the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence yesterday and outlined all of the reasons Ireland should join PESCO. Many of us made the point about the haste in which this is happening. I compare and contrast it with when the foreign affairs committee was considering our Irish Aid policy some time ago. There were public consultations, submissions and meetings before One World, One Future was produced. Recently, we were also doing a review of Irish Aid and, again, we welcomed submissions from NGOs and the public. We had meetings and the Minister attended with his officials. To me, that is a full debate. However, this has not happened with PESCO and it should have happened because it is a major shift in our defence policy. The principle of PESCO is to strengthen Europe's military capabilities through specific collaborative defence projects. Despite what the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, said yesterday about it not threatening our neutrality and legal advice being sought from the Attorney General, this is alarming. We know that Attorneys General have got it wrong in the past. Supposing we accept the view that our neutrality is unaffected because there is no agreement to come to the defence of others, nevertheless PESCO implies a much deeper defence co-operation than has been seen before. This is bringing us into a place which I believe undermines and threatens our neutrality. I also believe it is at odds with our reputation for our humanitarian work and the respect in which we are held on human rights issues and for the role we played in designing the sustainable development goals and ensuring their support from 193 countries. The word "military" does not appear anywhere in those goals and military co-operation is not seen as a way to achieve the sustainable development goals.  As a member of the foreign affairs committee and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we meet delegations from countries that are in conflict. They ask us how we achieved peace here. We consistently tell them about the process of the Good Friday Agreement - the sitting down, the listening, the dialogue, the negotiations and the compromise. However, PESCO is about a military solution, which is very much at odds with our traditional role and our involvement on the international stage to date. Why are we jeopardising this? We all value the role and the work of our reputable peacekeeping forces. It seems to be suggested that those of us who are critical of PESCO and oppose it are being somehow dismissive or disrespectful of our troops. That is absolutely not the case. There is a major difference between our peacekeeping forces and similar forces of those countries with military roles in previous years. We have never had a military role which is one of the reasons our forces are held in such high regard. The Minister tells us that there are no provisions in PESCO for a European army but that is very much at odds with what some European figures say. People have mentioned them already. In 2015, Jean-Claude Juncker named PESCO as the way forward to realise his forceful calls for a European army with a budget of €38.5 billion for the years 2021 to 2027. Yet, four out of five people in this country support neutrality. The Minister spoke about threats. There are no threats to Ireland. It is an island country. It is neutral and its policies and plans all stress that. There will be a change if we do join PESCO. We are told Malta has a very small and limited defence capacity and therefore does not intend to participate. Malta is in the Mediterranean; we are on the periphery of Europe. It is illogical that Malta does not have to participate when we have to. The Taoiseach said this country needs to co-operate with other countries. This is definitely the case. Military co-operation, however, is a totally different matter. There is no doubt but that we need to increase our defence budget. Surely, however, that is to improve pay and conditions for the forces and to purchase equipment. Some of the proposed projects for PESCO are military operations. We have not been told exactly how this will be organised. What is the timeframe? What are the guidelines? Given that this measure is to go through, how will we decide the operations in which we take part and the ones in which we do not? We do not have that information, which is vital. I presume and hope there will not be a late-night telephone call between people. We saw the disastrous consequences of that in the past. Military operations in other regions, including Central America, South America, Africa and south-east Asia, are destabilising regions. They are not solving anything. PESCO will ally us with countries that have agendas in respect of countries in Africa, countries that have mineral wealth. Some of the latter are allies of the European countries. We need to continue in our traditional role of peacekeeping and peace-building. It is in carrying out this role that we are respected and influential. One does not fight fire with fire. That is what a military solution is doing.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	PESCO is a European army in embryonic form. It is a sign of a deepening alliance. It is a formalised, binding mechanism for the collaboration of independent member state forces. It is an integral part of the defence articles in the Lisbon treaty. Its purpose is to give the European Union, including its member states, the ability and autonomous capabilities for military actions, removing the need for wider NATO support, specifically US support. Dubbed the sleeping beauty of the common foreign and security policy by federalists, PESCO was intended to be introduced when the treaty came into force in 2009. However, the challenges in ratifying the treaty, notably its rejection in Ireland and the associated popular fears about greater EU integration, more of which we heard today from certain quarters in the European Union, ensured that PESCO was shelved as a step too far while other aspects of the common security and defence policy, CSDP, were developed. The revived drive behind PESCO reflects broader militarisation of EU foreign policy, development policy and the Juncker Commission's sustained efforts to increase integration and work towards a European defence union. The relevant articles of the Lisbon treaty, Articles 42 and 46, require member states to make troops available, commit to consistently upgrading military capabilities and meet required capability thresholds, among other things. The nature of missions for which PESCO forces will be utilised is defined in Article 43, which states missions "shall include joint […] operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation." It continues: "All these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories." This means that PESCO would give the European Union the ability to intervene in conflicts, similar to those in the former state of Yugoslavia, Libya and Syria, outside both NATO and UN structures. While some people may argue the merits of this, we argue, as a neutral country, that we should stick within UN structures and not within military alliances that would essentially mean we were part of an EU army. PESCO is clearly unconstitutional. In light of recent Dáil debates on similar issues, such as Irish involvement in European Union Naval Force Mediterranean, or Operation Sophia, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will present the humanitarian aspects of PESCO while ignoring the wider issues and overtly militaristic nature of the European Union's CSDP. A shallow analysis like this will likely create a view of PESCO as non-controversial but the role of PESCO within the CSDP is clear. Without PESCO, the CSDP will never reach the level of integration envisaged by the European Union. It presents a fundamental threat to our neutrality as PESCO and EU defence policy in general have, as the CSDP has become more established, become closely aligned with NATO's European pillar. Even the requirement to increase military expenditure under PESCO is in line with the NATO requirement to bring military expenditure to 2% of GDP. Many people will be concerned, in the first instance, that this could be a threat to our neutrality. Many will be concerned that this is more about integration in the European Union. It is more about an effort by those who want to create a United States of Europe, with its own Parliament, army and common defence plan. While this Government will quite rightly defend this State against attempts to create a consolidated tax base, it does not seem to have the same problem when similar attempts are at play to create a single military alliance and single defence and military structure within the European Union. I suppose this goes to show where the Government's priorities are. It is federalist when it comes to defence but it is not when it comes to corporation tax. Let us consider the cost. If we have to put more money aside for military expenditure, it will come from public services at a time when there are crises in the health services and in housing provision. There are too many people on low pay and too many who need to be supported through supplementary welfare. There are too many living in poverty. How can any government or state that is neutral and presents itself as neutral sign up to an alliance such as this? It will increase military expenditure, increase contributions, undermine our independence as a sovereign state and undermine our neutrality, which has been a long-standing position of the Irish people. For all these reasons, I am absolutely opposed to this alliance.

In fact, we are not departing from anything. We are merely participating in what we have participated in for many years, much to our credit and the credit of our Defence Forces. It is far from the case that we are departing into the darkness. In fact, what we are required to do on an ongoing basis is to be absolutely certain that our Defence Forces are upgraded in accordance with best practice. The reason is that defence forces may have to relate to and communicate with one another right across Europe, while engaged in peacekeeping or addressing a threat to security. While Ireland is a neutral nation and will remain so - we are very proud of our neutrality - it still needs to have some access to the best training available and to have our Army, Naval Service and Air Corps involved in the training taking place in the jurisdictions of our neighbours. One should remember we are now entering a slightly different security situation. With Brexit, a new scene is developing, and we need to be alert to it. I do not live in a constituency with military bases - I did for quite a long time, as the Ceann Comhairle knows - but I am aware that, much to the country's credit, our Defence Forces have deported themselves very well all over the world. They interacted with all armies in a peacekeeping and peace-securing capacity. They paid the ultimate price in many cases for the UN, in various locations. This is not a new phenomenon. It is something we need to be quite clear about. We need to protect our Defence Forces so they will be best equipped to deal with any situation that may arise. It may arise here or in peacekeeping circumstances but, regardless of where it arises, it is imperative that the Defence Forces be equipped properly. It would be totally and grossly unfair to expect them to take on a role, be it peacekeeping, peace-supporting or peace-enforcing, in any location unless they are as well equipped as everybody else. The important point is that we should not expect the Defence Forces to be just as good as other defence forces; we expect them to be better. They have always been better. We need to be absolutely certain that the provisions we sanction in this House are produced on the basis of what we know of the past performance of the Defence Forces and what they are likely to be called on to do in the future. If we do so, we will be doing something in support of them, their families and what they need when they engage as part of an international peacekeeping force or in other circumstances, as in Africa, eastern Europe and all over the globe in the past.It would be wrong for us to in any way downgrade them and to dismiss them as if we were somehow entering into a new era that we or they have never known about before. They have distinguished themselves in those situations in the past. Would anybody expect that the Army would be equipped in the same way today as it was in the 1960s? Would anybody expect us to have an Army that would put up with that? Would anybody expect us to have an Army that could defend itself if we were only to equip it in the same fashion as it was equipped in the 1960s, when it first went abroad, and paid a high price for it? We should have learned a lesson then. I think we did learn a lesson. Without a shadow of a doubt we are neutral but we are still part of an international community. I hate to have to mention it but many countries were neutral at the time of the Second World War and their neutrality was not always respected. There is a need for us to have our own well-equipped Defence Forces capable of undertaking whatever is required in a situation of neutrality but at the same time, given the history of the Defence Forces, to be able to engage with and work along with other defence forces involved in similar peacekeeping arrangements.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	Like other speakers I am very pleased to be able to make an intervention on this very important issue. Much reference has been made to the haste surrounding the debate but it is important to remember that we lived through this debate and finally the Lisbon treaty came into effect on 1 December 2009. We are living in an ever-changing world with very significant challenges and constantly transforming threats to security. Co-operation with respect to security and defence will, sadly, have to continue to play an increasing role across the European Union. I was saddened and worried to hear Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mention that there were no threats to Ireland and that we are a neutral country and an island. It would be wonderful if that were the case but, sadly, that is deeply untrue. We may not know from where exactly the threats are coming but we cannot blindly believe that we somehow are immune to some of the terrible threats and successful actions from the depraved minds of terrorists across the world, including in Europe. National defence policy and spending must reflect the seriousness of the commitments to the tasks to address the challenges ahead. I listened with particular interest to the contribution of Deputy Lisa Chambers. She is correct that we need to have much more debate in this House about where this country is going in terms of protecting the security of our citizens on this island and in the European Union where tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of them are living. I do not believe that when the debate takes place people within the Parliament will continue to take the view that Ireland should not play its role. There has been discussion about how much money should be spent on defence. It is a NATO commitment, not a commitment from member states such as Ireland, to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP. That said, I strongly believe that in order to fulfil our United Nations and peacekeeping commitments we should also seek to increase our spending on security and defence. Much reference in the debate has centred on comments from European politicians such as President Macron. They are entitled to their opinion but we have a Constitution and a Parliament and we can determine our own decisions. Europe has many politicians who from time to time make pronouncements with which we do not agree. We are not subject to those individual opinions because we have our own procedures. Many politicians within the EPP, the European Peoples' Party, the largest political grouping, have also been mentioned. At the congress of the EPP some months ago it was made very clear that PESCO will allow member states which are able and willing to work together within the European framework to improve their common defence and solidarity but it went on to say that this would not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of member states. That is the clear policy of the largest political family in Europe which enshrines in its declaration the independence and nature of Ireland's neutrality. It is vital that we do not forget for one second what PESCO is seeking to achieve. It is all too easy to be part of the hard left family of parties in Europe who continue not to take the responsibility of trying to achieve what PESCO is seeking to achieve, namely, to have co-operation to save the lives of European people, including Irish people, by working together given that we must accept there is now very significant co-ordination among terrorist organisations to attack us all. We all stood in this House following the attacks in Paris and said it was an attack on Europe and Europeans. We must work together to ensure that we protect ourselves and take our responsibility seriously as a wealthy, modern European country. I strongly support the collaboration between the two largest parties and I hope the others will stop playing party politics as they did with the passenger name recognition measure in the European Parliament, another measure to protect the safety of Europeans, and that we can all work together to ensure there is greater co-ordination to protect the people of Ireland, Irish people in Europe and other Europeans and partner countries such as Tunisia and others who need our support in these difficult times.

I recall listening to all three make very strong and strident arguments in favour of Irish neutrality and against the use, for example, of Shannon Airport as a military base for the United States. It is a great pity they have lost their voice in this time of need when the motion is before the Dáil.

#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	Maybe so. I believe the world has become very unstable. Countries and military blocs are becoming more combative with their interactions and diplomacy is at a low ebb internationally. At the same time we see the EU is tooling up militarily. Ireland has a proud record of neutrality, which should be cherished, protected and enhanced. We should be able to reaffirm our commitment to a different type of international politics, one that is focused on peace, justice, equality and human rights. My colleagues, Deputies Crowe and Ó Snodaigh, have introduced constitutional amendment Bills in this Chamber previously to ensure Irish neutrality would be further enhanced within the Constitution. Some might believe the EU has a benign influence on international affairs but it is not without flaw. It is not long ago since we saw EU countries support armed and masked protesters who took over the buildings of the elected government in the Ukraine. We saw what happened there. It set in train the secession of Crimea and the ramping up of east-west tensions. The French have a long history of military activity in north Africa as well. The purpose of PESCO is to give EU member states the ability and autonomous capabilities for military actions, removing the need for NATO and the support of the US. I believe this is part of a significant acceleration towards federalist demands for broader militarisation of the EU's foreign policy, increased integration and increased European defence.I would ask the question; have they learned nothing? The more we integrate the EU, the more EU scepticism we create. PESCO is part of that continuum of EU integration. We are long past what is a tolerable level of EU integration. The desire of the EU federalist elite to integrate Europe further is the greatest existential threat to the EU at the moment. These are, in part, the reasons why we see euroscepticism in Britain and elsewhere. The idea of PESCO is firmly rooted in Articles 42 and 46 of the Lisbon treaty, which require member states to make troops available and to commit to consistently upgrading military capabilities. PESCO would give the EU the ability to participate outside NATO and UN structures in conflicts in certain areas, for example, should conflict arise again in the former Yugoslavia, Libya or Syria. PESCO is the polar opposite to neutrality. For example, it will force Ireland to bring military spending up to NATO levels of 2%. Deputy Durkan referred to the need to respect our military and the Army and to invest more money. That is for sure. We should pay them a decent wage, for God's sake. Army personnel had to take a 24-hour event outside the Houses of the Oireachtas recently to ensure families could earn enough to live properly in this country. We should absolutely pay them more, but there is no need to go down the route of massive militarisation to achieve that goal. I have a problem with the fact that politics internationally likes euphemisms too much. People use words such as "peacekeeping" as a fig leaf for military advancement. Indeed, we remember Mr. Bush going to war against Iraq in the first instance in an effort to safeguard world peace. I have no doubt that PESCO will be using the same words in the same way. My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, made an important point earlier. He said there is an opportunity cost in this regard. Every euro the Government spends on upgrading military capabilities in the State is a euro taken out of the pockets of people who are struggling to live, get a house over their heads, access health care and educate their children. There is a stark choice before us. I urge the Oireachtas and the Dáil to choose the citizens of Ireland and their needs over the military elite within Europe.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to once again reaffirm Ireland's strong support for the development of the common security and defence policy and of EU capacity to respond to international crises in support of the United Nations. Ireland will continue to participate in all aspects of CSDP, as we have done since CSDP was established. Indeed, Ireland has been one of the leading contributors to CSDP operations deployed under UN mandates or with the support of the UN. No one in the Chamber needs reminding of the horrific events of recent times in London, Manchester, Paris, Berlin or further afield in places such as Beirut, the Sinai Peninsula, Mali or Mogadishu. We cannot ignore or consider ourselves immune to the ever-changing, complex and intertwined nature of such threats to individual states and to international peace and security. No country acting alone can address these challenges and Ireland has a responsibility to show flexibility and deliver the support and modernisation needed to respond to this complex and changing environment at home and abroad. While defence and security in the EU are generally seen as a collective and shared responsibility, it is accepted that each sovereign state has the right to choose its defence policy. In Ireland's case, that is one of military neutrality. However, the adoption of such a policy is not a policy of isolation but the freedom to participate and contribute to international peace and security in accordance with nationally determined values and principles. A key challenge to the European Union's capacity to mount crisis management operations remains a lack of essential capabilities and the political will from member states to commit the required capabilities for CSDP operations. PESCO has been designed to address this challenge by enhancing the political commitment of member states to develop and deliver capabilities in support of CSDP. In this regard I remain fully satisfied that Ireland's participation in PESCO will contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for United Nations mandated missions engaged in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I have heard the concerns expressed by some Deputies. Several key points are worth repeating in this regard. Participation in any PESCO project is entirely voluntary and it is a matter for each member state to decide whether to participate on a case-by-case basis. PESCO is a further initiative in strengthening the capacity of the Union and member states to support international peace and security. PESCO is also a means of enhancing interoperability and, through working with EU partners, ensuring that our Defence Forces are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training. The participation criteria for PESCO expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols and will respect the constitutional provisions of member states. Participation in PESCO is entirely voluntary and has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality, for the triple lock or the crucial roles we play in crisis management and peacekeeping operations. PESCO was comprehensively discussed in the context of the Lisbon treaty and was approved by the people when they voted on the treaty in October 2009. PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon treaty protocol to address the concerns of the people and Ireland's declaration. Moreover, the legislation setting down Ireland's approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that vote and enacted in November 2009. PESCO has nothing to do with the creation of an EU army. Nothing in the treaties provides for the creation of an EU army. PESCO is about member states making more binding commitments to each other to jointly develop military crisis management capabilities for use in support of CSDP operations. The world in which we live is a different place now compared to ten or even five years ago. The formal launch of PESCO takes place next Monday, 11 December. It is crucial that Ireland moves forward in tandem with our fellow EU member states and plays its part in helping to address the complex challenges facing the Union and its citizens. I welcome the debate on Ireland's intention to participate in PESCO. PESCO is a crucial mechanism in which Ireland can participate jointly in projects to develop capabilities that will enhance our contributions to crisis management and peacekeeping operations. The Government is satisfied that the best approach is to move forward with our fellow EU member states in developing essential capabilities. The Government is satisfied that whatever projects we eventually decide to participate in will contribute to the enhancement of the capabilities of Ireland and the EU for United Nations mandated missions. Such missions involve engagement in peacekeeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Everyone in the Chamber is rightly proud of the work undertaken overseas by the Defence Forces in what are increasingly-challenging UN-operated or UN-mandated missions. I am confident that the people want to see the men and women of the Defence Forces equipped with the latest and best equipment and training. That is critical to ensure they can operate safely and effectively in support of international peace and security.

It grants the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the power to address anomalies in pay scales as a result of scheduled pay increases in the Bill. It grants the power to the Central Bank Commission in respect of employees or officers of the Central Bank of Ireland. The Minister is submitting this technical amendment in recognition of the independence of the Central Bank of Ireland. Section 6(d) of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides for the commission to fix such conditions, including conditions as to remuneration, for employees of the Central Bank of Ireland. As such, it is appropriate that the power to amend the salaries of Central Bank of Ireland staff, where anomalies arise, lie with the Central Bank Commission rather than the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	This concerns the penalty clause, particularly for unions which have not signed up to the agreement.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	This is the section which is causing most disturbance among teachers because it will freeze increments and also be discriminatory against certain teachers. It will affect the pensions of some who are already at a disadvantage and thus affect the future of the profession. It is being seen as an assault on unions, normal industrial relations and the principles of trade unionism. It undermines the duty of a union to protect the interests of its members. It is very severe. I have seen figures for the potential loss. The cumulative effect is actually staggering from the point of view of repudiation. People will not recover what they have lost.  The section is creating tensions between those unions which accepted the agreements and those which repudiated them, between those employed prior to and after 2011. We all know the value of education and about the importance of the curriculum and methodologies used, but as a former teacher I know that the teacher-pupil relationship is absolutely crucial. It depends on the quality of the teacher and the teaching, which is of the utmost importance. We have to ensure young people entering the teaching profession can maintain that quality. Entering on an unequal footing is not helping. During the years we have seen - I saw it in my time a good while ago - graduates with the same degrees - a BA, a B Com and Bachelor of Science - enter private industry and make much more money. This adds to the inequality. It began with the budget decisions and is made worse by what is contained in section 21. Teachers should not have to endure that inequality within the profession and are finding it intolerable. It will not encourage anyone to enter the profession. I understand the TUI membership is particularly affected because 35% of its members are new entrants. It is hoping that number will increase, provided people enter the profession. Surveys show that there is a shortage of teachers, although the Minister might say otherwise. Across the board there are difficulties in recruiting and finding substitutes to provide cover because private industry is making it much more attractive for those who would have entered teaching, while others are leaving to enter private industry. There has also been a drop in the numbers applying to undertake the master of education degree. This situation cannot be allowed to fester for three years. Will the Minister, therefore, acknowledge that there is a problem? Will he re-engage with the unions in question? I understand the three-year freeze was never mentioned in the talks. Therefore, it is undermining the agreements. The unions only became aware of this provision when the legislation was produced.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	I am speaking in opposition to this section. There are significant punitive and draconian measures included in the Bill which are disproportionate and without precedent. They include the freezing of increments for three years and a nine-month delay in pay restoration.There is also the unequal two-tier system of payment for public servants, which affects in particular those employed after 1 January 2011. This section is effectively punishing those public servants who disagree with the proposed pay agreement. It freezes increments for three years. Not only are dissenting unions and their members being denied the benefits of the agreement but the existing pay scales of members from dissenting unions are being cut by law. This is being done through an increment freeze and it is the equivalent of denying entitlement to service pay and other measures. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan states, these measures are not in the public service pay agreement. They have been introduced by the Government in this Bill and they will therefore be put into law. They are being imposed by the Government. They are effectively the equivalent of industrial relations punishment beatings. It is important as these punishments will become precedents for employers in commercial semi-State bodies and private industry. In effect, it will give the green light to private sector employers and those in semi-State bodies to punish employees in their respective companies. One can hear as we speak the argument will be that the Government was able to do it so surely they should be entitled to do the same. There is a significant precedent being set, not just for teachers, nurses and public servants but for the wider employment spheres. There will be clear precedents to allowing private sector and semi-State employers to punish their workers in the very same way as the Government proposes to do with this section. It is outrageous and should be withdrawn by the Minister.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	The Bill before the House this evening is a missed opportunity to strive towards one of the most important underlying principles of fairness and justice in our society, the principle of equal pay for equal work. It is a fundamental undermining of this principle that any person should be paid considerably less for doing the same job simply because they started work after a certain date. This multi-tiered system, which results in some public servants earning as much as 20% less than colleagues, should be abolished as soon as possible so all public servants can be paid the same for the same work. It is equal pay for equal work. How many times need we say this to the Government but it still refuses to commit to that principle? Not only does the Bill completely avoid addressing this basic inequality but it also applies punitive measures to those who have not signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, 2018-2020. It is on that basis that the Green Party will oppose sections 21 and 33 this evening. Section 21 would suspend the awarding of increments to members of trade unions or staff associations that have not notified the Workplace Relations Commission that they agree to be bound by the PSSA. These members are defined in section 3 as non-covered public servants. They will not receive any benefits of the agreement from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. To incentivise sign-up to the PSSA, section 21 provides for less favourable terms for public servants not covered by the PSSA between 2018 and 2020. These include slower pay restoration, with each increase taking place nine months later than the scheduled pay increase, and the suspension of incremental increases up to the end of 2020. Meanwhile, section 33 of the Bill requires non-covered public servants to start giving pension contributions from a lower wage threshold than anyone else. Given the number of young and new teachers in this country, it is of no surprise that it is among the teacher unions that the PSSA has been roundly rejected. Tá riachtanas ann go léireofar meas ar ár múinteoirí óga agus nua-cáilithe sa tír seo. Cad is fiú dóibh a bheith ina seasamh os comhair ranga má tá an múinteoir béal dorais leo i dteideal pá níos airde ná iad. Caithfear luach a gcuid saothair a thabhairt dóibh luath nó mall. The teaching profession in our country is being devalued and this will have a detrimental impact on the quality of education in Ireland. Our younger teachers play a vital role in the future direction of education and they are highly skilled and specialised classroom practitioners, entrusted on a daily basis with major and far-reaching responsibility. By allowing differential pay scales to continue, we are telling our teachers that they do not matter and we do not care. That is simply not good enough. They will leave our shores if this continues. At some stage in the near future will this Government please commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work? Do it now. The Green Party will oppose this section.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	310	This is clearly a crucial section as it is the gun to the head of the unions. It says to union members, and particularly teacher unions that refuse to sign up to the deal because they stood for solidarity across their members and intergenerational solidarity between older and younger workers, that they can have whatever vote they like but we will punish them if they do not sign the deal. It is scandalous and a very deep and significant attack on the right of workers to organise in trade unions and bargain in a free and collective fashion. It is very extreme interference with trade unions and the right of workers to decide. Where workers are presented with a deal, they should have the right to say "Yes" or "No" and not be faced with a position from the State, as an employer, whereby if they say "No", they will be punished significantly. They will lose increments for three years and never catch up again with an equivalent worker in a union that has signed up to what was a very bad deal. New entrants faced with the new pension scheme will lose doubly, as they will lose here and with their pension, which would be based on total earnings. It is a really rotten section that is part of a rotten approach by the Government. I agree with Deputy Healy that this sends a very dangerous signal of encouragement to ruthless private sector employers to similarly go after workers. We oppose this section.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	This is my third time to speak in the Dáil today. I was thinking that although the issues I speak to seem unconnected, they are not. These connected themes are homelessness, the attempt to bring us into a European army and the pay and pensions Bill before us. I say these are connected because this Government is weaving its own intricate web, connected by various threads. The Minister might wonder what I am talking about and the connections I speak of. Another woman died on the streets last night and homelessness is a continuing and spiralling crisis in the country. Continuing policies of the Government have failed to deal with it. More resources are probably needed to prevent any more deaths on the streets. It will probably snow tonight and we will be thinking of those people stuck on the streets or in tents in parks. The second matter of the permanent structured co-operation and the European army is related because it demonstrates how easily money can be found, if the Government wills it, under the Minister's guidance. Our military spending is to be moved from almost €1 billion to between €3 billion and €4 billion. It seems to be no bother and we will be able to find money to put into armies, arms and aggression. Meanwhile, we cannot find the money to house the homeless or end the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. The Minister stated repeatedly in the Dáil in recent years that he could not end the FEMPI measures because doing so would be too costly for the State. As I recall, he referred to a figure of €260 million per year. Whatever the loss to the Exchequer, it certainly would be lower than the €3 billion to €4 billion the Government just voted through to take us into a European army. The Minister can find the money to suit his ends but not to pay teachers properly and end the discrimination that is at the root of the decision by the three teacher unions to reject the public service stability agreement. Following that rejection, the Minister used a big hammer to beat the unions over the head and impose further discrimination and pay inequality on their members. It is the first time a government has used such a hammer, and all to crack the three nuts that are the teacher unions. Fair play to them for rejecting the deal. Many public sector workers have told me they felt they had no choice but to accept the deal, precisely because the Minister was holding that big hammer over their head and warning that rejection would leave them tied into a permanent arrangement whereby the pay inequality imposed on them would not be addressed. The FEMPI legislation is being used to penalise workers and entrench inequality. In my area, 11 beds at the Linn Dara facility in Cherry Orchard, an adult mental health unit, were closed at the beginning of the summer. By the admission of the Minister for Health, it proved impossible to recruit the psychiatric nurses needed to keep every bed occupied. A new recruitment drive has since commenced and the beds were reopened, but there is no escaping the admission that pay policy is driving nurses away. The nursing unions voted to accept the deal under pressure of the Minister's hammer. The teachers, however, have not fallen for that tactic and the Minister is now seeking to penalise them. The FEMPI legislation is a truly extraordinary emergency measure in that it is apparently possible to retain it year after year. There are 8,000 people homeless in this State, with families living in hotels for Christmas, children writing to Santa asking for a home instead of toys, and people dying on the streets. The Government will neither acknowledge nor address the housing emergency, but it insists there is a financial emergency that necessitates using legislation to penalise workers who do not agree with Government pay policy.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	Has the Minister explored any alternatives to the particular provisions set out in this section? Should his party and Fianna Fáil vote these proposals through, when does he expect to enact them, or are they simply something he proposes to hold as a threat? Everybody in this House, including the Minister, should acknowledge that the vast bulk of the membership of the teacher unions, including the executive officers, acted in a way that showed extraordinary support for the State during the course of the economic crash and the mass unemployment that ensued. They did so at a time when the challenges faced by teachers and others involved in education at all levels were exceptionally difficult. The Minister ought to give due regard to what these people, and people in the wider public service, have done for this country in its hour of greatest need. In the midst of an economic emergency that led to 330,000 people losing their jobs, it cannot be disputed that public servants did their bit. I am aware that the Minister has a very high regard for education, as does the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, as an important glue that binds Irish society. Parents in this country see that their children can advance through the education system, that academic achievement is not just for the privileged who go to private schools and avail of private tutoring, and that ordinary people - people like the Minister and me - can and do go to college.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	Some people are very privileged and most of them acknowledge that privilege. There are many people in this House who owe their position to the work done by teachers across the education system. As I said, I am aware of the value the Minister attaches to education and his appreciation of the school he attended, which had a great showing in the recent survey of the numbers of pupils going on to further education from schools throughout the State. A large number of schools in Dublin 7 and Dublin 15 also performed strongly, which is an enormous source of pride to me. I am very interested in the Minister's thinking on this. The industrial relations strategy the Minister is pursuing is not a good one and he should rethink it. As I said, the efforts shown by the leadership and members of the teacher unions through the course of the crisis deserve recognition. There should be recognition, too, of the genuine difficulties facing new entrants to teaching, who include both young people and mature people who transferred from other careers to become teachers. Many of us owe much of our own advancement in life to the teachers who guided us. In the case of Members of the Oireachtas, that advancement has led to our having the privilege to work in this House. Why has the Minister chosen this particular approach to the people who made such a tremendous contribution to Irish society? We should remember, in addition, that in recent years, teachers have had to manage increasing numbers of non-national children whose home language is not English. Teachers took the view that every child in every school should be a welcome child. That tremendous achievement is evident in towns and villages throughout the country, in large schools and small schools. Will the Minister pause to reflect on what he expects to achieve by this approach? The recent Exchequer returns for November, the most important month of the year for tax receipts, were extremely strong by any standards. Those results afford the Minister capacity to address issues. Will he consider, in a spirit of collective bargaining and in the broadest community interest, appointing a mediator and bringing people together to discuss this issue? I accept that he cannot pay out on everything at once and that he must make a budget which will work. However, the Exchequer returns are far better than expected and the outlook to 2020, because of the continuing return of people to employment, has improved. As such, he has capacity to address particular situations. Earlier this week, I raised with him the serious difficulties for people currently undertaking master's degrees and doctorates. Some of these people, having spent a lot of money and devoted additional years to study, will go on to work in institutes of technology, for example, and find the entry rate of pay is lower than that for teachers in second level schools or even primary schools.There are issues that need to be addressed if the Minister wants to prevent people being forced into other areas where they will not be able to apply their skills in education as they may have wanted or going abroad to work. Many of these people will get a job in places that will not allow them to live at home, rent free. They may have to move to the next town or to a city. Rents are a big problem for anyone on a starting salary. If possible before Report Stage I would like the Minister, who is also responsible for relationships with the trade unions, to make arrangements for further conversations with the whole trade union movement. Many in the public service have accepted the arrangement and if it is changed for one it must be changed for all. The recent Exchequer returns show there is room for manoeuvre which, instead of damaging the economy, would inject more wages over time into it. That is one of the growth mechanisms it needs in order to support people who want to buy a house and to commit to a 30 or 35 year mortgage. The Minister would then be doing a kind of social building, if he could envisage a change that would allow the country to prosper more. This would help not just those in the public sector but the overall economy. Notwithstanding that the budget has to be in early October, the November figures show a change. It would be wise if the Minister were to study those figures and to give consideration to a format of settlement of this issue that would allow the country to advance.

The overall effect of this Bill is to bring to an end the income reduction our public and civil servants endured during the crisis. Several Deputies have called on me to end the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. From an earnings point of view this is bringing FEMPI to an end for 90% of those in the public services. For the other 10% who are at the higher end of the income scale, depending on how much they earn, we are committing to do that one or two years after the three-year period of the agreement which this legislation aims to make happen. The difference in respect of this is in the additional contributions we will ask people to make to their pension benefits in the future. We will introduce an additional superannuation payment which in turn will recognise the value of public pensions, given all the changes that have taken place in the availability of private pensions and the fact that we have to ensure we have the revenue to pay for people's pension entitlements in the future. In response to the demands this evening to end FEMPI, this is ending FEMPI in a responsible and affordable way. That is one of the reasons a majority of those who voted on this agreement voted to accept it. Despite the allegations that I have a hammer in my hand and that I want to penalise workers that is not what this section seeks to do. It simply seeks to recognise that the benefits of the agreement, and in particular the timing of the benefits of the agreement, should recognise those who voted for it as opposed to those who vote against it.

The availability of those increments and the ability to gain them depends on whether people are part of a group of unions to accept the agreement.

Twelve to 18 months ago many Members here claimed that collective agreements had come to an end because of the difficulty caused by the stance of Garda unions but the Lansdowne Road agreement was stabilised and we negotiated a new agreement to take its place. Deputy Burton asked last night if I valued collective agreements. Many times in that period I said collective agreements are the fairest and most affordable way to manage industrial relations within our country but if someone is looking for an agreement there has to be a benefit to being in it. If there is no benefit what is the point in coming up with an agreement and balloting on it? In response to some of the other questions, of course I acknowledge the contributions of teachers and public servants. Results this week show that our students at primary and second levels are among the strongest in Europe in terms of literacy and numeracy. That reflects the contribution our teachers make. I was in St. Laurence O'Toole primary school in North Wall this morning and was again reminded at first hand of the amazing contribution all our teachers, special needs assistants and teaching assistants make to looking after young boys and girls and giving them the best start in life.  Section 21 is consistent with other legislation to date, particularly the Acts of 2013 and 2015, in that it recognises that benefits will be concentrated on people inside the agreement. It is my ambition to get everyone into the agreement. There are processes in place to deal with some of the issues being raised and we will over time get to the point where all unions are in the agreement by doing the kind of work we have done over the past 12 to 18 months, engaging in a responsible way with unions and negotiating with them to come up with agreements that are fair and affordable.  Several Deputies referred to Exchequer returns, the economy and so on but we are using the health of the economy over the next few years, which we hope will not be endangered by developments such as Brexit and developments elsewhere, to pay for this agreement. That health and the pay rates that will be legislated for in this agreement also give us the ability to hire more teachers, nurses and civil servants in the future.That is why I commend this section and the Bill to the House.

They see it as causing undue discomfort and upset to them. This comes from branches of the trade union right across the country. When I hear moderate members of trade unions calling this section reckless and infuriating, that makes me sit up and listen to what they are saying. They say that it could give rise to industrial unrest, which nobody wants. They see it as being disrespectful of the principles of trade unionism and the democratic rights of members of trade unions to either accept or reject proposals. It is obvious that those who reject something will be punished and it is unprecedented in the history of labour relations because it is a form of coercion of public sector workers. I get the impression that the Minister will re-engage in a way because he says he wants to get members into the agreement but it will mean looking at the unfairness that this section represents to members.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	I want to lend my voice to the points others have made on this. We are supposed to be a free country. People should have the right to express their views and vote for or against a pay agreement. What the Minister has already proposed and what is already happening is that people who vote against this agreement are penalised by slower restoration of pay. There is no justification for this further punishment and targeting of people who have chosen, as is their democratic right, not to accept a pay agreement. It is true to say, and I put it to the Minister, that limiting people's increments is outside the scope of the pay agreement and should therefore be outside the scope of this legislation too. I cannot see any justification for that other than a fairly ruthless attempt to coerce people into accepting what the Minister wants them to accept. By any kind of standards in a free country, that kind of approach by Government is unacceptable. That is why I believe Members of this House should have no choice but to reject this section. It is not acceptable that public sector workers would be coerced into a situation where they are particularly and deliberately penalised for a legitimate choice they make. It is not acceptable and I urge the Minister to withdraw that threat.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	From listening to the Minister's response to what we have said here that there has to be an incentive to accept an agreement, it is quite possible that he was never in a trade union. I think he is an accountant, so that is quite possible. I will tell him how it works. A deal is negotiated between a union and bosses. The deal is then put to a person who votes on it. That person can accept or reject that deal, depending on how he or she perceives it. If a person rejects it, or if a majority rejects it, then the matter goes back to the drawing board with an employer, or one accesses the industrial relations machinery, such as the Workplace Relations Commission, or the Labour Relations Commission in its day. If it is accepted, the minority that refused to accept it is stuck with it. Those people are paid it. They are not told that they can go to hell and stick with the other agreement and that because the others were good boys and girls, they will get the new one while those who rejected it do not. That is what we call collective bargaining. The Minister has just driven a coach and four through those rules. He clearly does not understand how trade unionism has traditionally worked or else he wants to create a new form of trade unionism à la Paschal Donohoe. That is exactly what he is trying to do here.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	I asked the Minister if he had a proposal for this legislation, if he goes ahead with it, as to when he plans to enact this section. An art of being a negotiator and negotiating change in, and supporting, institutions is to grasp opportunities as they arise to resolve situations which have become extremely difficult. In his public statements, the Minister has indicated a strong desire to do that. He was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in a period when there were several transport strikes which threatened public transport and the commuters who use it. That was resolved through resolution work and mediation. I suggest to the Minister that he should adopt the same approach and perhaps come back to us on Report Stage since he is perhaps not in a position to give an indication now. When Deputy Calleary moved his amendment to have a study on the impact of restoration, the Minister, who is to be commended for it, agreed to do that. That was completely sensible. In parallel to that, to send a signal that this is an issue that requires resolution, it makes sense for the Minister to stay his hand on this and to provide for the information to be received. He acknowledged that the November tax returns were very good. We need wage growth for the recovery of the economy. Any economist will tell the Minister that. If he wants to resolve the housing crisis or the homeless crisis, that is part of what is needed. I am putting forward a completely sensible proposition. While the Minister may not be able to address this issue right now, I would be happy to bring forward a proposal either privately or for Report Stage and that he could address this then. The Minister's predecessor, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, was very gung-ho about transport strikes when he first became Minister, then it dawned on him that it would be very difficult for, and would impact with extraordinary negativity on, people who use public transport and a resolution was found after much talking. I suggest the Minister turns to a level of mediation and of resourcing, since it requires resources which are there, and offer a timescale which will address this issue in a more timely way than what he has proposed, given the circumstances. He is always saying that if circumstances change, he can change his mind. The economic circumstances have changed, so the Minister has space.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I ask the Minister to reconsider this. We should look at it from the point of view of a teacher union. It will see this as a proposal which will only inflame the situation. I know the Minister said that there would have to be a return to negotiation and mediation to hopefully resolve this. The Minister has to understand where people are coming from with a hammer hanging over their heads and how they will perceive this. It is not just the Minister who should reconsider this. I do not want to put Fianna Fáil on the spot but if it opposes this section, then it will not go through. I appeal to Deputy Calleary because, as we saw the last time we debated this when his amendment was pushed through when all Members of the Opposition came together, I think there is a responsibility on the Deputy and Fianna Fáil not to sit on their hands with regard to this section. To do so will not go unnoticed by the teacher unions. It is not just a matter of the Government position. Fianna Fáil's position will not go unnoticed.I appeal to the Deputy to join us in opposing the section.

In terms of how we will move this matter forward, many Deputies are referring to two different issues. The first is the distinction between covered and non-covered workers, which is at the heart of this section. When will the provision be implemented? It will be implemented by the passage of this legislation. It does not require a further statutory instrument from me. It will be implemented when this legislation becomes law if, as is hoped, it is passed tonight by the Dáil and next week by the Seanad. On the issues the teacher unions are currently raising on the different position on pay curves depending on when a person joined the teaching profession, that process is already under way. We are doing that work. My Department met all the teacher unions in recent weeks and we will continue that work with them to see if there is a path by which this matter can be resolved. That is not contained in the legislation but it is in the agreement with the teacher unions. We will honour our commitment to that process and see whether there is a way to progress the matter, if not resolve it. I will return to a point I made last night. All of us in this House should know that agreement is not reached with one part of the public service without an expectation and a need that it will apply to all. While it is an issue that many Deputies raise on behalf of teachers, there would be an expectation that how we deal with the matter in the teaching profession would be applied everywhere. As I have said in response to the questions put to me, that work is under way with the teacher unions and we will take it very seriously.  Further, I can tell Deputy Bríd Smith that I have ample experience of the trade union movement from both sides of the table.

However, in view of the process we have inserted into the legislation through our amendment, we will be abstaining.

The reductions were applied to allowances across the public service, including allowances paid to health sector staff such as nurses and consultants, as well as allowances paid to other public servants such as gardaí and teachers. The reductions were not confined to allowances for nurses and midwives only. As such, it would not be appropriate to consider a faster restoration of allowances for one cohort of staff in the public service. The Government's approach to the restoration of pay reduced under the FEMPI legislation has always been consistent with that taken during its application, that is, providing for equitable treatment for all public servants. The particular sectors to which the Deputy refers will be part of the first module of work to be undertaken by the Public Service Pay Commission when it examines difficulties in recruitment and retention in the health service. It will examine that sector, in particular.  On the broader issue of allowances, I have met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss matters associated with this issue. We are going to deal with the broader issue in the context of the oversight committee under the public service stability agreement. Within both avenues there are ways to deal with allowances. I, therefore, ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment in the light of the fact that two avenues will be open to examine the issue.

"Early pension restoration for retired public servants 
27. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on restoring all public service pensions by 2019.".The pensions issue has caused huge frustration for public service pensioners. Even though the Minister has had engagement with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants, the fact that its members were not formally represented when their incomes were being addressed was a source of enormous frustration. There are deadlines for some public service pensioners who may not have the luxury of reaching the end of the agreement. The aim of the amendment is to ascertain the cost of bringing forward the restoration date to 2019 in order that we can have a proper and informed discussion on earlier restoration dates for pensioners.

I support the amendment and oppose the section and the following ones because in reality what is happening is that what was set up as an emergency measure, a pension levy, which was all about demonising public sector workers and suggesting they had something for which they had not paid, which was not the case as they had paid for it and continue to do so, has been made permanent by transforming the pension levy into a so-called additional superannuation contribution that will continue to be made indefinitely. In reality, it amounts to a pay cut and the consolidation of the pay cut for public sector workers. I am against the measure.

The sections define the limited number of public servants who will be exempt from the additional superannuation contribution from 2019. The Bill provides for the exemption of "core" members of the North-South pension scheme which applies to the staff of the six North-South implementation bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement and Tourism Ireland. In 2015 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and the North-South Ministerial Council agreed that the "Hutton" reforms that applied to the UK public service would also apply to "core" members of the North-South pension scheme. The reforms included increased contribution rates and provided for revised career average retirement benefits from April 2015 onwards. There is one staff member who has "reserved rights" under the local government pension scheme of Northern Ireland. This member's pension terms incurred the same reforms that applied to "core" members. On that basis, the amendment will ensure this member is granted the exemption from the additional superannuation contribution.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I will be brief. We spoke about section 21. This is the corresponding section in a sense in that it is the other part of the gun to the head of the unions to punish them for opposing the pay deal. Section 21 took away increments and this section punishes union members in their pensions.For that reason, we oppose it because of the impact on those workers and also because of the message it sends in denying people the right to freely bargain collectively, reject deals on their merits and vote and not to be punished for it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	Yet again the Minister is trying to implement a separate set of conditions for those not covered by the pay deal. It seems that the intention is to punish those unions which rejected the pay agreement. Whatever about having slower pay restoration for the unions that rejected the deal, it is simply unacceptable that they be further punished by applying a brake to increments and what is proposed in the section which will ensure their pension contributions will be payable at a lower threshold than those covered by the pay deal. It is important to point out that the three teacher unions that voted against the pay agreement did not do so because they wanted more money. They voted against it because they wanted a fair deal for their new entrant colleagues. As long as that remains the position and that unfairness for new entrants continues, as a result of this legislation, teachers will become more and more aggrieved about the way they have been treated and punished because of their democratic decision. The Social Democrats oppose section 33 in its entirety, as it will introduce less favourable additional superannuation contributions in 2019 and 2020 for public servants who are not covered by the pay deal compared to those who are. We propose that the same charging structure for public servants who are covered by the pay deal, as outlined in section 32, apply to all public servants. We also propose the deletion of section 32(1)(c) to clarify that all public servants would be covered by the same charging structure. Unfortunately, that amendment has been ruled out of order. We vehemently oppose section 21.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	As we had this debate when we were discussing section 21, I do not intend to rehash all of the arguments made. I appeal to the Minister to step back and reconsider pressing ahead with the section. As I said when I was discussing section 21, the attention of the teacher unions will once again focus on the position Fianna Fáil has taken. Fianna Fáil Members suggested they were going to abstain in the vote on section 21 and, presumably, section 33. In effect, that will allow the sections to be passed because the Minister has given Fianna Fáil a fig leaf. A report is to be commissioned and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months of the enactment of the Bill. That is a flimsy reason for Fianna Fáil Deputies to sit on their hands. Certainly, it will not go unnoticed by the teacher unions. If it does, I will not be long in reminding them of it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	I believe the approach taken in the section is wrong and should be reconsidered. The Minister has experience of previous industrial relations disputes in which there was a threat of sustained strikes. I imagine he does not want to see a breakdown in public sector union relations in any area but especially the education sector. That would not be good for the country and it certainly would not be good for children and others being educated. I, therefore, urge the Minister to examine the matter within a comprehensive economic and mediation framework. I urge him to seek to resolve the matter without this section coming to pass. It really is not in the best interests of the education sector. As I said before, the Minister should recall that the teacher unions and their members have been exemplary contributors to the recovery of the economy. He should bear that in mind.

Effectively, the Government is introducing by law punishments for unions and individuals that take a different view from their employers. That is outrageous. The silence of the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is absolutely deafening. This legislation sets an extraordinary and dangerous precedent. It directly affects public servants, but it sets a dangerous precedent for employees and workers in the private and semi-State sectors also. The punishment sections should be withdrawn by the Minister.

However, I emphasise that the focus of the approach taken in the Bill is consistent with that of previous legislation and how I handled industrial relations disputes in the recent past. The idea is simply to try to ensure there are benefits to being inside an agreement and, therefore, in explaining why people should vote for it.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I move amendment No. 20:In page 27, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:"(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and subject to—(a) any requirement under any regulations made under section 37 to repay any overpayment, or(b) any requirement arising under section 39 to repay any deduction,a contribution of a public servant who is a member of a superannuation scheme established under section 33AG(2) of the Central Bank Act 1942 shall be paid into the trust fund established under section 33AG(4) of that Act in respect of that superannuation scheme.(4) A reference in subsection (3) to a superannuation scheme established under section 33AG(2) of the Central Bank Act 1942 includes a reference to a scheme resulting from the merger under section 33AH(3) of that Act of such a scheme and a scheme referred to in section 33AH(1) of that Act.".This amendment amends section 38 of the Bill. This section requires that the additional superannuation contribution must be paid centrally into the Exchequer, or otherwise disposed of as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform so directs. This technical amendment provides certainty that any additional superannuation contribution which is paid by employees or officers of the Central Bank will be retained in the trust fund of the bank's pension scheme. It is required to address inconsistencies with current legislation and to ensure the Central Bank's independence, as required under EU law. The bank provides a funded pension scheme for its staff under section 33AG of the Central Bank Act 1942. The bank is obliged to transfer all contributions made by members of its pension scheme to the trustees of that scheme. Without this amendment, any additional superannuation contribution made by Central Bank staff would be required to be surrendered to the Exchequer, which is at odds with current legislation. Following consultation with the Central Bank and having received the opinion of the European Central Bank on the draft Bill, this amendment is required to ensure the independence of the Central Bank. It should be also noted that, uniquely and in recognition of the bank's financial independence, the additional superannuation contribution will apply only to employees and officers of the Central Bank with the written consent of the Governor of the bank and the Minister for Finance.

It should be noted that this is not an acceptable way of doing business or an acceptable way of treating the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.

This is the second such statement under the 2015 Act. In addition to this oral report, I am arranging for a written statement to be laid before both Houses. As reported by the Environmental Protection Agency last week, Ireland's emissions increased by 3.5% between 2015 and 2016. This is disappointing and highlights the urgent need to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions and energy demand. Our economy remains the strongest performer in the EU, with GDP increasing by 5.2% in 2016, and we are once again approaching full employment, all of which puts pressure on emissions, especially in terms of transport, energy use and construction. The EPA expects Ireland's emissions to continue to increase until at least the end of the decade, which makes it even more imperative that Ireland take further steps to arrest this trend. As Members know, that projection is required as part of the transition statement and was published just last week. The Government's framework for taking action to reduce our emissions is the national mitigation plan, which sets out more than 70 individual measures to reduce emissions. Progress on the implementation of these measures is reported in the annual transition statement. The plan also provides the framework for further work on the medium to long-term measures to make the necessary deeper emission reductions in future decades. The mitigation plan is not a static document and must be formally reviewed once every five years. This week I secured Government approval for a new support scheme for renewable heat to stimulate and support the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems with renewable energy and contribute to meeting Ireland’s 2020 renewable energy and emission reduction targets and support the establishment of both the biomass and bio-gas sector in Ireland. I am announcing the extension of the free warmer home scheme to families in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance from 1 January next. This scheme offers a broad package of measures free to householders in need of energy efficiency upgrades worth an average of €3,000. For community energy projects, I am putting in place a new funding commitment, with €28 million worth of grants to be awarded in 2018, which will include support for a transition away from fossil fuel use. The intention is to ensure every application which is agreed in partnership with the SEAI will secure funding. A new incentive for people who want to move away from using fossil fuels to heat their home through a significant new grant of €3,500 for heat pumps will come into effect from April of next year. Waste efficiency is effective climate action. I am committed to making the regulatory changes required in order to provide an organic, or brown, bin service to every single home in Ireland, regardless of where people live. Industry has a responsibility in driving the successful roll-out of brown bins to every community with a population greater than 500 people. That is ongoing at the moment but I am determined to ensure every single home, regardless of location, has that opportunity. The measures put in place this year to phase out flat fees are not new for about half of kerb-side household customers who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan which contains a per-lift or weight-related fee. This approach gives the market the flexibility to offer a suite of pricing options to further promote the prevention and segregation of household waste. We have also put supports in place for electric vehicles, including home charging points and rolling out further infrastructure across the country in regard to charging and a 0% benefit-in-kind rate for battery electric vehicles. It is the intention to enhance some of these supports in the coming years.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am conscious of the challenges we face in tackling climate change in the transport sector. The extent of this challenge and the scale of transformation required for Ireland to move to a low-carbon and climate resilient economy is becoming increasingly evident, never more so than now for our transport sector. Ireland is not unique in this. Across Europe, transport accounts for nearly 27% of all non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions. Recent reports from the EPA have indicated a further growth in transport emissions by almost 4% in 2016. The progress we made in reducing transport emissions by 25% between 2007 and 2012 is being eroded by significant transport demand growth, only some of which is being met in the most efficient ways. Therefore, it is imperative that fundamental changes to our transport system be made, including how we travel and the types of fuel and technology that we use. In 2016, four key measures reduced transport emissions in Ireland. First, our investment in the public and sustainable transport network led to an increase of almost 31 million journeys on subsidised public transport and commercial bus services since 2013. Second, as a result of the implementation of EU vehicle standard regulations limiting tailpipe emissions, new cars entering the fleet are now approximately 25% more energy efficient than they were in 2007. Furthermore, the redesign of the VRT and motor tax regimes in 2008 to be based on CO2 emissions rather than engine size had a positive effect by changing buyer behaviour and encouraging the uptake of low-emission vehicles. Finally, the introduction of a biofuel obligation scheme to incorporate sustainable fuel into our conventional fuel mix has substantially decreased transport emissions. In 2015 alone, this biofuel measure reduced CO2 emissions by 356 kilotonnes. Our national mitigation plan has firmly established the Government's commitment to work towards our national decarbonisation objective. Transport will play a significant role in the national mitigation effort and has already made positive progress. Twenty-four transport mitigation measures have been set out, with 29 associated actions. As is the nature of the plan across all sectors, these measures do not signify a complete roadmap for our mitigation efforts, but a representation of where we are now and what we can achieve. Continued investment in public and sustainable transport remains the cornerstone of our mitigation response. We continually seek to improve the quality and capacity of our transport network and encourage modal shift away from private car use. In Dublin alone, more than two thirds of all journeys into the city centre are now made on foot, by bicycle or by public transport, representing an increase of over 10% in the past six years.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I am pleased to present the annual transition statement for the agriculture, forestry and land use sector and, in particular, to outline the efforts that the sector is making to address our climate change obligations. The long-term vision for the sector is an approach to carbon neutrality that does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production. This is challenging and complex, which has been recognised by the Climate Change Advisory Council. According to recent EPA projections, overall national emissions increased by 3.5% in 2016, with agricultural emissions increasing by 2.7%. In the agriculture sector, there has been a decoupling of emissions from output. For example, in the 2012-16 period, dairy cow numbers increased by 22% and corresponding milk production increased by 27%, yet emissions increased by just 8%. In terms of the sector's contribution to the national mitigation plan, a number of cross-cutting measures aimed at reducing emissions, coupled with benefits for climate change adaptation, water quality, biodiversity and rural development, have been included in the plan. For example, there are a number of forestry measures, with afforestation being one of the primary opportunities for the sequestration of agricultural emissions and the key agricultural investment priority. Forestry planted under the afforestation programme includes biodiversity enhancement areas and mixed tree species, with specific schemes to support the establishment and management of native woodlands. The role of conifers and broadleaves in contributing to the development of the forestry industry and achieving environmental goals is well understood. Given the limited time available to me, I will not have an opportunity to discuss each measure, but I assure the House that the agriculture and forestry sector is engaging in a range of measures to ensure that growth continues on the basis of sustainability. We have a thriving agrifood sector, one that is efficient and environmentally conscious. The sector is committed to working with all stakeholders so as to ensure that it continues to play its part in meeting our climate change obligations and challenges.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	Since my Department is the lead Department in respect of a number of proposed measures in the national mitigation plan, I welcome the opportunity to update the House on how we are doing in that regard. I had a chance yesterday to discuss this matter in the Seanad. The measures that my Department has responsibility for predominantly relate to the national planning framework, NPF, and the built environment, as well as the overall area of social housing. These measures include actions Nos. 10 and 65 and measure T11 of the NPF. Under this, we must ensure that climate considerations are fully addressed in the new framework. The publication of the NPF consultation draft towards the end of September represented a unique opportunity to set out an ambitious vision and 20-year strategy for what our country should and can look like in 2040. The NPF covers a broad range of issues relating to planning for Ireland's future over the period to 2040. They include national policy objectives to support climate action and planning, sustainable land management and resource efficiency and renewable energy generation. Action No. 20 is on wind energy guidelines, which we are committed to finalising. The 2006 wind energy development guidelines, issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, set the national planning policy context for local authority plan-making regarding wind energy and the determination of planning applications and appeals by planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála. A Programme for a Partnership Government of May 2016 contained a commitment to conclude the review of the guidelines with a view to offering a better balance between the concerns of local communities and the need to invest in indigenous energy projects. In this regard, a "preferred draft approach" to the review of the guidelines has been developed to address a number of key aspects, including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. This draft approach was announced in June 2017 by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, and the previous Minister in my Department, the current Tánaiste. Built environment measure No. 7, or BE 7, relates to social housing upgrades. Local authorities are undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of the Department, on the least energy efficient social homes. Funding of €107 million was provided from 2013 to the end of 2016 in order to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in some 58,000 local authority houses, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland's carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020. Measures BE 10.1 to 10.4, inclusive, relate to the introduction of building regulations transposing the requirements of the energy performance of buildings directive in respect of nearly zero energy buildings, NZEBs, and major renovations. The 2010 energy performance of buildings directive requires member states to ensure that, from 31 December 2020, all new buildings meet NZEB standards and major renovations are brought to a cost-optimal standard. In parallel, new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities will be required to achieve this standard two years earlier, that is, by December 2018. In Ireland, more than 40% of the total energy produced is used in the building sector. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, report Energy in Ireland 1990-2015 shows that there has been an increase in energy demand of 18% in the residential building sector and 29% in the commercial building sector. This is why increasing the energy efficiency and reducing the energy demand of buildings is so vital. These advanced performance requirements are being implemented through Part L of the building regulations. In terms of dwellings, my Department is working on an amendment to Part L and the corresponding technical guidance document. That will be out for consultation in early 2018. Regarding buildings other than dwellings, the statutory instrument amending Part L was signed into law last month. In general, this amended regulation will apply to all building works, material alterations, material changes of use and major renovations that commence after 1 January 2019. All of the measures that I have outlined are key actions in the built environment's contribution to Ireland's national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan for addressing climate change. I am confident that we are making steady progress in all areas and that the measures outlined will be implemented to achieve the projected emissions reductions.

They are here to share the blame. That may be helpful. I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss climate change, one of the foremost issues of our time. The past few months have not brought a lot of good news with regard to Ireland's climate change policies. Only this week the Climate Change Advisory Council issued a stark warning that if Ireland does not introduce major new policies and measures it will miss the 2020 targets. While this is not news to any of us who have been paying close attention to Ireland's overall emissions trends, it is still somewhat shocking. Ireland's leading meteorologists, economists and academics, who the Government has explicitly appointed to monitor our progress on climate change, have categorically warned us that we are failing to meet our commitments. That needs to be a wake-up call.  Fianna Fáil has a strong record on introducing progressive measures to tackle climate change, and is committed to an ambitious environmental programme which includes tackling climate change. We published the Climate Change Response Bill on 23 December 2010, which passed First Stage in the Seanad before the Dáil was dissolved. By contrast, this Government is guilty of what Einstein termed insanity. It keeps doing the same thing over and over again, but expects different results. In the face of repeated warnings from international and Irish experts that Ireland is all but certain to miss every single one of its climate-related targets without stronger policy initiatives, the Government has continued with the same policies. As a result, Ireland is rapidly becoming known in Europe as a climate dinosaur and a nation which refuses to pull its weight when it comes to taking radical climate action. According to the Climate Change Performance Index 2018, Ireland is now the worst country in Europe when it comes to taking action on climate change. This has to end. From a moral perspective, it should be clear to us that mitigating and preventing climate change is now inextricably linked with the welfare of the global population, particularly those in developing nations where people and their livelihoods are almost entirely exposed to the negative impacts of climate change. Across southern and eastern Africa, approximately 36 million people experienced famine in 2016 as a result of climate-related weather changes. This is likely to increase, a point to which I will return. Suffice to say, the moral imperative for us to act should be clear. In ignoring climate change, we are also going against our own interest. Many of the measures which will combat climate change will also be of immense benefit to Ireland as a country. Moving to a greener economy will not only cut Ireland's carbon emissions, it will also create jobs, support local economies, purify its air and make us less dependent on foreign dirty energy sources. It is not only the right thing to do, it is the sensible thing to do. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, passed by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, marked a serious retreat from the 2010 Bill published by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government. Instead of clear targets it had vague aspirations. When Deputy Varadkar became Taoiseach in May 2017, he promised a new ambition on climate change. He has criticised Donald Trump for his inaction on climate change and for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. I agree with the Taoiseach's sentiment in this regard, but he conveniently seems to have forgotten that under his Government, Ireland will be the second last EU country to ratify the significant COP21 agreement which was brokered in Paris in December 2015.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	He also neglected to mention that while Ireland remains a member of the Paris Agreement, we are not taking action to fulfil the commitments we have made under it. In line with the European effort-sharing directives arising out of the Paris Agreement, Ireland is committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 30% on 2005 levels by 2030. The proposal also includes flexibilities related to the transfer of emissions trading system, ETS, allowances and inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry credits. The inclusion of these flexibilities in the draft proposals may ultimately reduce Ireland's non-ETS 2030 targets to 20.4% This is an attainable target and represents a moderate increase on our 2030 targets. However, given that we are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by just 4% to 6% on 2005 levels by 2030, this is unlikely to transpire if we continue with the status quo. While I acknowledge many might welcome a 2°, 4° or even 10° increase in Ireland's average temperature, I cannot overstate how devastating temperature increases will be. We have already induced significant climatic change. Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous heat. Further increases will have a devastating impact on how we lead our lives. Even if we meet the Paris goals of 2° warming, which is challenging in and of itself, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will experience almost annual heat waves which have the potential to take lives. It is worth noting that the combined populations of these two cities is close to 26 million people, so we can only imagine the potential for destruction and displacement. At 4° warming, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. The impact on food production is likely to be catastrophic. Many estimates suggest that for most staple cereal crops, such as wheat, rice and other crops that account for almost 90% of the world's dietary intake, there will be a 10% decline in yields for every 1° increase in temperature. In the face of a growing global population, that has frightening implications for global hunger and geopolitics. Some scientists, for example, have linked the Arab Spring of 2010 to a Russian wheat failure caused by an unprecedented summer heatwave. Many of us in the Chamber are already aware of the potential consequences of our inaction. The real question is, therefore, what we need to do to cut Ireland's emissions. From a European perspective, Ireland has a unique greenhouse gas emissions profile, one which is relatively heavily weighted towards agriculture due to the lack of heavy industry within our overall economy. From a climate perspective, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Ireland is among the most carbon-efficient food producers in the world and the sector has made an admirable effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990, agricultural emissions have reduced by 9.7% in Ireland, while other areas such as transport have increased emissions by 120%. The flexibility awarded to us under the land use, land use change, and forestry components of the European effort-sharing reflects this. There are also opportunities for Ireland to achieve win-win outcomes in meeting our reduction targets. For example, only 11% of our land is forested compared with 33% across the EU, and afforestation has a high potential for helping us to meet our emissions targets. Even the forests planted since 1990 absorb a massive 18% of Irish agricultural annual greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, economic returns from forestry are strongly competitive compared with other land uses and could pay high dividends in terms of regional development and employment.  In contrast to agriculture, however, other sectors have been considerably less ambitious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Home heating now accounts for almost 10% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and 27% of our overall energy use, placing us as the nation with the third highest emissions per capita in the residential sector. We are still reliant on oil, coal and peat to heat our homes, despite there being much cheaper, more convenient and effective ways to do so. Fuel poverty is estimated to affect anywhere from 200,000 to 400,000 households. We have all heard stories of mothers having to choose between heating their homes or feeding their children and pensioners who spend all day in a library to save on heating. There is no need for this. Retrofitting should be directly targeted at these homes. While we have had some good programmes in the past, they have not been extended to the extent they should have been. They were not ambitious enough and we did not put enough money into them. Sadly, we will pay fines with money that could have been used to improve our housing stock had we planned a little better. While the Minister boasts about the funding that is allocated to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for the purposes of various energy schemes, the reality is that between 2011 and 2017 there was a 70% decline in the number of homes which were retrofitted. It is still very difficult for individual homeowners to access affordable financing to retrofit deeply their homes and we still have no scheme for the rental sector, which comprises almost 500,000 homes across the country.We need to wise up and create a new green deal agency that would create low cost financing and expert advice to people seeking to deep retrofit their homes. The time has passed to concentrate exclusively on lagging jackets and attic insulation. In order to meet our 2050 targets, Ms Marion Jammet of the Irish Green Building Council estimates we will have to bring 75% of our homes up to A2 BER ratings. The other big elephant in the room is transport and I am pleased the Minister with that responsibility is here to listen at least to the contributions. As the economy recovers, Ireland's transport emissions are once again rising. They now represent approximately 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, meaning there has been a 13% increase in the past four years. By 2020, transport is likely to account for 30% of Ireland's emissions. As with home heating, the technologies to reduce transport emissions are already there and have a significant amount of co-benefits. In 2008, we committed to 10% of the national fleet being electric by 2020. Clearly, Fine Gael could not handle the pressure of this and the target was subsequently revised down to having 50,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020. Even this unambitious target now seems farcical. As we approach 2018, there are still only approximately 2,000 electric vehicles on Irish roads. This is pathetic, and again, while the Government likes to claim it is invested in getting electric vehicles on the road, the policies suggest otherwise. There are still only 70 fast chargers in Ireland and while I appreciate the Minister has indicated there will be more, this means the Government expects road users to spend up to eight hours refuelling their cars on the side of the road or in a filling station. Even where chargers are provided, electric vehicle owners often find they are blocked by a standard petrol or diesel car or, even worse, that the electric vehicle was clamped while they use the charging point. I raised the matter of benefit-in-kind before with the Minister and he indicated it would run for three years. I went back to my office to check the Finance Act, as passed, and it only provides for a year. The Minister has indicated he is favourably disposed to the longer term but to get people to invest in electric vehicles, particularly the corporate sector and people using them, certainty is required. Certainty would be provided if the law provided the benefit to extend for three years. It is in the Act that the measure is only for a year, albeit open to review. I hope the Minister for Finance does so but, sadly, people I might try to encourage to purchase electric vehicles have said there is no guarantee about benefit-in-kind. If it had been put in the Finance Act, at least we would have some certainty. It is a disappointment and unfortunate that nobody was able to convince the Minister for Finance or his officials of the benefit of that. Charging infrastructure aside, we are not doing enough to incentivise people to purchase electric vehicles. When one looks to Norway, a leader when it comes to electric vehicles, we see a range of soft incentives, such as free parking, permission to use bus lanes and reduced motor tolls for electric vehicle users. I have proposed the elimination of those altogether for such vehicles and I know the Minister has made some proposals in recent days on this. None of these is currently in place in Ireland when we must really front-load this activity. We must make it a no-brainer for people in order to get to that critical level of 50,000 vehicles. We need to show initiative. I was in Amsterdam at a conference over the weekend and taxis there using the airport or certain parts of central districts must be electric vehicles. Such initiatives could force the commercial side to move on this. On a public transport level, there is a similar level of apathy within the Government. Currently, where public transport infrastructure exists, it runs on fossil fuels, making us an outlier among our European peers. This is not for want of trying within the public transport system. Last year, when Dublin Bus made an application to trial hybrid buses, it was rejected by the National Transport Authority. I do not know if the Minister was aware of that. On a broader level, we continue to underinvest in public transport infrastructure. Per capita, Ireland spends only a third of what cities such as London or Manchester do on public transport. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult and inconvenient to commute between our regions and within our cities, something that is harming our overall economy and its competitiveness. Both IBEC and Dublin Chamber of Commerce are just two of the bodies that have highlighted the negative impacts this is having on Ireland as a foreign direct investment destination. All this is to highlight not only the dangers that Ireland is unleashing as a result of our failure to deal with climate change but also to emphasise the opportunities we are missing. We are not only throwing away the chance to build a brighter future for our grandchildren but we are harming our own economic growth, jeopardising the livelihoods of our own agricultural communities, ruining our own quality of life by sitting in and between congested cities and inducing lung issues by burning dirty fossil fuels. I urge the Ministers and the rest of this Government to heed what I and other contributors tonight will say, as well as the advice of countless non-governmental organisations and people who are very well qualified in this area. We must finally get real about climate change.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	It is a major disappointment to be here discussing the progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In the Thirty-first Dáil, I was a member of an environment committee that passed legislation in good faith. On behalf of Sinn Féin, we highlighted the shortcomings in that legislation but put our faith in it on the basis that the Government might do better. We felt it was better to have legislation in place as it was not replacing anything else. We felt it was at least a good start but the approach to date has been an abject failure. Report after report has shone a glaring light on this. The figures are stark. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports a 7% rise in greenhouse gas emissions over two years rather than a reduction, with a 2.7% increase in emissions from agriculture, a 3.7% increase from transport and a 6.1% increase in emissions from the energy industry. Earlier in the year, the EPA reported we will miss our targets for 2020; there was meant to be a 20% reduction but it will be somewhere between 4% and 6%. It will be worse, according to the most recent report. It is an horrendous record, further emphasised with the 2018 Climate Change Performance Index that indicates us as the worst European country. It is a bad record to have. Our emissions were decreasing at one point, not because of any action being taken by central or local government or specific measures but rather because the economy collapsed. This week the Climate Change Advisory Council has slammed the Government's response to this, the lack of action and weakness in the National Mitigation Plan, which is totally inadequate. We must see change. I say that in good faith as I am passionate about this subject. Not reaching our target speaks volumes about the lack of action, vision and any long-term planning by successive Governments - not just this one - with regard to climate change. Emissions keep going up rather than down and we lack any specific measures to change the direction from going towards the carbon cliff I warned of four, five or six years ago. We are approaching that head-on. We need binding specific sectoral targets for emissions and we have nothing to fear from those. We also urgently need a wide portfolio of renewable energy sources, including biogas, biomass, offshore wind, solar and support for emerging technologies, such as wave and tidal power. I say to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that we are not tapping into huge areas that could generate jobs and wealth in rural areas. We should be able to do that to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With these sources of energy we can protect our environment, increase security of supply and create very important employment in rural areas. Ireland will instead spend billions of euro importing fossil fuels. We are seeing the effects of climate change with erratic weather patterns, demonstrated with the likes of Storm Ophelia, which is the worst I have seen in my lifetime. At the time we saw widespread damage in my constituency in Laois and parts of the roofs of houses were blown away in the estate in which I live. We saw that replicated right across the country. In the past couple of weeks we saw flooding in Mountmellick and the oldest people in the town had not seen such flash flooding before. It brought extensive damage to more than 100 homes. Portarlington was also flooded. The Government's solution is the National Mitigation Plan, which is not fit for purpose. I am not trying to have a go but I am saying it to the Minister. It is failing in an abject fashion and it should be revised immediately if we are to take climate change seriously. Wide-ranging change to Government policy is required and without action we will face large fines for not meeting our targets.We are facing environmental implications beyond the control of future generations. It is up to this generation to act now to address those implications. Diversifying our renewable energy sources will bring not only environmental benefits but also security of supply and predictable prices, factors which are vital in developing indigenous industries and attracting foreign direct investment. We must not only approach this issue from an environmental perspective but also with the objective of developing rural areas, creating jobs and improving farm incomes. In the midlands, the ending of peat cutting by 2030 will leave us with three power plants that could be converted to handle locally grown biomass. We need to emulate the vision shown by Government in the 1920s and 1930s which saw the establishment of Bord na Móna, Coillte and the ESB. Governments in the past did some great things in terms of invigorating those sectors, rolling out rural electrification and so on. There is no sense of that type of vision from this Government. We are currently importing biomass to mix with peat to use in the Edenderry plant. Bord na Móna plans to invest €60 million in a biomass plant in North America, from which it will be imported into Ireland. I understand Indonesia was a source of biomass for this country at one point. That is not the right approach. The product is so lovely and clean that one could put it on the kitchen table, but it has clocked up huge carbon miles to get here. In addition, we are losing out economically because we are not creating the product here. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, takes on board that key point. Why is there no proper scheme to allow farmers on marginal land in the midlands and elsewhere to grow willow for biomass? There are huge tracts of land on which there is very little production but which would be ideal for this purpose. Only four farmers signed up to a scheme that was introduced in 2015. Bord na Móna, the farming organisations and individual farmers have raised this issue with me. We cannot simply collapse the jobs in the midlands when we stop peat extraction. Alternative employment must be put in place and here is the opportunity to do it. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, who has responsibility for Bord na Móna, must take action in this regard. As sole shareholder in that body on behalf of taxpayers, he must prevent the proposal to have a plant on the far side of the world shipping biomass here. We are capable of producing it here - after all, we have done more complicated things in harder times - and doing so will protect rural jobs and reduce our emissions. We have failed to harness the potential to generate biogas from farm waste. We have a large agricultural sector relative to our size, but we need to diversify and make it more sustainable. A European Commission report has identified Ireland as having one of the best resources in Europe for biomass precisely because of our large farm sector. Germany has 8,000 biogas plants and the British have 600, even though they are hardly world leaders in this technology. Meanwhile, we have a pilot scheme coming into operation next April to inject gas into the grid. Taking advantage of our potential in this area will provide a long-term revenue stream for farmers and the potential to create sustainable jobs in rural areas. A study by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland this year cited the potential for the creation of up to 3,000 jobs in the biogas sector in Ireland. Slurry can be mixed with food and other waste to generate gas, but there is a problem in that regard. The State is currently seeking an extension of our derogation on the spreading of pig slurry. Other countries, however, are generating fertiliser and gas out of the same slurry. In his announcement this week regarding the renewable heat incentive scheme, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine referred to the ongoing examination of biomethane. What does that mean? We do not need to examine anything in that regard because we know it is working elsewhere. We must displace fossil fuels where we do not need to use them. The issue of climate justice is not something in the distant future but for the here and now. Parts of the Philippines are already being washed over. We in the West are creating a far larger carbon footprint than are people in developing countries. We have a responsibility to address the damage we are doing. There is a much greater role for local authorities in our efforts to address climate change. We need special policy committees, SPCs, in each local authority which would produce action plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within their area and deal with things like cycleways, walking routes, upgrading homes and managing renewable energy schemes. I acknowledge the good work already being done in this area, but we must do more. Transport contributes more than 20% of our emissions, but we are not even off the blocks in addressing it. There are fewer than 2,000 hybrid vehicles on the road, for instance, and the ESB has been told by the regulator that it can no longer support the infrastructure associated with those vehicles. We must invest more in public transport, reduce car usage and increase the number of cycle lanes. Blame for the lack of action on climate change does not lie solely with this Government but also with previous Administrations and, in fact, with everybody in society. We all have a responsibility to act. Planning in this regard must extend well beyond the term of this Government or any of our political carers. We need urgent action to produce a coherent plan for diverse forms of renewable energy and power, particularly sources which complement intermittent renewables. Now is the time for action in the form of specific and targeted measures. There is support for that right across the House and growing support in communities. We need to get on with it.

However, the inaction on climate change is the greatest disappointment to me in terms of the activity of this Government. Climate change is, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the most serious issue facing our planet. Hundreds of thousands of people are losing their lives on an annual basis because of it. The political instability it is creating across the mid-east and north of Africa is leading to the fall of regimes and to millions of people coming to Europe's shores as refugees. The response by the Government has been disastrous. That we are at the bottom of the European class in terms of the results we are showing is an embarrassment to everybody in this Chamber. The frustrating thing about it for me is that many of the mitigating activities that have been proposed would actually create jobs and fix balance of payment problems on a radical basis. This year, I launched a report on farming in Ireland and some of the figures contained therein are shocking. There are only 44,000 farmers in the State who are economically viable, for example, and the average wage for a cattle farmer is €12,500. Imagine if there were some way of giving money to farmers and meeting our energy needs as a country? What might be achieved if those needs intersected in some fashion? It drives me mad that we are not availing of the opportunities that are there with regard to biodigestors, micro-generation of solar and wind power and so on. All that is needed is a feed-in tariff to allow farmers to connect that electricity into the grid. How long does it take to create such a tariff? All the countries around us have had them in operation for ages. In the Six Counties, the roofs of buildings are festooned with solar panels that are sucking energy from the sun, providing energy for households and feeding excess energy into the grid. Yet we have no date for the introduction of a feed-in tariff. Why is Bord na Móna importing millions of euro worth of biomass from Africa? Why has the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine not created a supply chain mechanism to allow it to be produced in Ireland? It is incredible that money is being placed in pockets outside this country while our farmers are on their knees begging for funding. How can Britain under the Tories create more electricity via solar from March to September than it produces via all of its nuclear energy and all of its coal-fired stations? In this country, meanwhile, there is not one solar farm connected to the grid, never mind households or farmers being able to access the grid. It is incomprehensible. Cycling is very good for alleviating congestion in cities, taking CO2 out of the system, cleaning diesel fumes out of the air and improving the general fitness of those who engage in it.Cycling is operating on the clippings of tin in this country. The number of people dying in cycle accidents is increasing every year because this Government is not creating a safe way for people to cycle. I had the opportunity to visit the office for control of the grid in Brussels where I was shown trends in grid capacity in Belgium. The grid capacity is falling. I thought that must be because energy use is falling but I was told that microgeneration means less capacity will be needed in the grid in the future. We are nowhere near to having microgeneration of energy in this country. Why not? How long does it take? The only glaciers that are immune from global warming are the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Environment and Transport, Tourism and Sport.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzmaurice. The Government and the Opposition need to acknowledge that Ireland's engagement with the climate change agenda has been mediocre at best. We like to look down on the Americans in respect of this issue. We do not have a major problem here with a lobby of climate change deniers, such as there is in America. Our problem is different. If the American people did appreciate the reality of climate change, there is no doubt they would demand that something be done about it. In Ireland, we see the problem, accept it as fact, but do nothing, or, if not nothing, then not enough. Given the science of climate change and the global temperature tipping point, not doing enough is as bad as doing nothing. On the one hand, we accept that the world is warming and that human activity is the dominant cause. The urgent need to address climate change is largely accepted in political debate and among the general public. On the other hand, however, our record in achieving ambitious targets, within tight timeframes, remains poor. As a result, we are most unlikely to meet our legally-binding greenhouse gas reduction targets by 2020 and we will become open to sanction for breach of EU rules. The Citizens' Assembly report is proof positive that, unlike their counterparts in the USA, members of the general public here are way ahead of politicians and the Civil Service in their thinking. Some 98% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that climate change should be at the centre of policy-making. A total of 100% of them recommended that the State should take a leadership role in addressing climate change and 80% said that they would be willing to pay higher taxes on carbon-intensive activities. In three years' time, however, this State will be a law-breaker. The only question will be the extent of our liability. The fines may be of the order of at least €450 million, a shocking amount of money to hand over for our failure to plan for what has been coming down the road for so long. We will by then be faced with a new round of reduction targets for 2030 and beyond and will already be considerably in arrears and desperately trying to catch up. Under the EU climate and energy package, the target set for Ireland is that our greenhouse gas emissions should, by 2020, be 20% below their 2005 values. The fact is that we let the recession do the heavy lifting for us. Emissions peaked in 2001, with reductions in eight of the past ten years. The reductions were entirely due to reduced economic activity rather than the impact of any Government policy for permanent remedial measures. Just as we lowered our emissions during the economic crisis, now that the economy is picking up again, they are once again increasing in line with economic and employment growth. This is while domestic construction is still in the doldrums. Imagine what the figures will be like when this Government finally gets around to building some houses. Our emissions are increasing rather than decreasing. Every reasonable projection for 2020 shows that we will miss our reduction targets by a country mile. Today, Ireland emits more greenhouse gases than the 400 million poorest people on earth. Of the top ten per capita greenhouse gas emission polluters in the OECD, Ireland ranks ninth. The EPA figures for 2016 show a 3.5% increase. Broken down, this shows that agriculture emissions increased by 2.7%, transport emissions by 3.7% and energy industry emissions by 6.1%. There were significant increases across all of the main sectors and an overall trend of rising emissions. National emissions have now increased by 7% in just two years, indicating that we have not managed to decouple emissions from economic growth. Even taking account of all policies and measures in the pipeline, we will not meet our 2020 targets. In other words, full implementation of all Government policies and measures, including targets for energy efficiency in our homes and businesses and increasing renewable fuel use in transport and heating, will not be enough. It gets worse. The policies and measures currently in place will not see us comply with EU law and meet our current targets. New obligations for Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even more during the years 2021 to 2030 are under negotiation. The Government back-pedals. It argues that our 2020 target, unanimously approved here, was "unscientific” all along and was never achievable. It argues that we should not be told to curb our efficient agricultural practices and see them moved to less efficient parts of the world. This argument ignores the inconvenient fact that the projected growth in beef and dairy exports is posited on a change in Asian feeding habits that would, of itself, lead to increased carbon emissions regardless of from where the food comes. It is clear that, during successive Administrations, the much-vaunted whole-of-Government approach was simply non-existent. There was no joined-up thinking and no overall Government vision and commitment. The only sector that was close to achieving its target is electricity, for which the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment is responsible. However, that has gone into reverse, perversely, because one aspect of Government policy permits the ESB to burn more coal at Moneypoint, now that coal is cheaper, even though this completely contradicts another aspect of that policy. It appears that the State is also facing serious domestic legal challenges, grounded on a newly declared constitutional right to a sound environment. While the EPA's annual report serves for the rest of us as a wake-up call, the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and his colleagues give every impression that they have slept through the alarm again.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	Ireland signed up to unattainable goals. We are praising ourselves this evening because emissions dropped between 2007 and 2012. They did so because we exported 245,000 youngsters from our country in one of the worst recessions we have seen. Thank God the economy is picking up. There are 2.1 million people working now for the first time ever. When people do not have public transport they drive to work and then there will be more emissions. I travelled to Banbridge in County Down to see anaerobic digesters for making biogas. Not one person from any Department bothered to look at them. They are not in the plan. Farmers could produce grass to make gas. Slurry could be used in an anaerobic digester. It could be pelleted and we could make use of it for water quality and for the environment. These are things that we talk about but we are not going to do them. Ireland cannot stop progress in agriculture so let us do it more efficiently. This year, we will reach only 60% of our target number of trees planted. The trees all seem to be coming to the west of Ireland. We deserve to make a living there as well and do not want to see trees around every house. The whole country should share the brunt of this. Government should make sure that is done. Nobody has a problem with taking their fair share. When a farmer plants trees, the Government takes the carbon credit relating to those trees. It is not left to the owner of the private property. I believe in transport.For transport, electric cars can be used in cities if one is accruing a small mileage but we must remember the road we have travelled before this. From 2007 to 2009, we were told to buy diesel cars. The tax on diesel cars came down to €180 or €190 if one had a car from 2009 onwards because such a car was more efficient. They may have been more efficient but Volkswagen and other companies fooled everyone with regard to emissions and now those people who have just about finished paying for those cars are being told to scrap them and to go electric. Money does not circulate if one is living in a rural part of the country where one gets €12,000 to €18,000 per year. One cannot just ditch a car, throw it on the side of the road and decide to buy something new. It needs to be incentivised by Government. We are talking about it and the Minister, Deputy Ross, is involved. I spoke to Barry Kenny of Irish Rail, to Bus Éireann and to Dublin Bus. We can use gas buses but at the end of the day, in the last budget, we did not even have €1 billion because Europe has us tied in fiscal rules. If we are to change Dublin Bus, which would help the environment, from diesel to gas, it will cost a lot of money. Let us be honest and not live in fantasy. If we are to change the way our trains work, it will cost €2 billion to €3 billion over the next ten years. Do we have that money? Let us not live in a world of talking about something if we do not have the money to do it. There was an announcement yesterday that Bord na Móna is going to America to deal with Donald Trump. He is clapping his hands. His own guys are going to be working out there. They will be cutting timber, hauling it to a factory that Irish taxpayers will subsidise, a lorryman will pick it up with a 40 ft wagon, haul it to a port and it will go on a ship, then land in Ireland, where it will burn at 40% efficiency. At the same time we are doing that, we will tell Bord na Móna workers that they are sound lads and not to worry, since peat production at Bord na Móna will be phased out by 2030. What jobs will they get? Be honest with people that if that biomass is coming to a port whether in Foynes, Drogheda or Dublin, there will not be a Bord na Móna worker picking it up because it put the hackers that it had and its own drivers out onto the bog. It let go of the part-time workers. It hired in subbies to haul its stuff. The 1,600 workers deserve an answer. Where will they be in this plan? I have heard people around the country talk about willow. We tried miscanthus and they went bust with it. Today, I spoke with a contractor who said he can produce willow for the price Bord na Móna is getting today. Contrary to what I have heard all evening, willow only grows on good land to the tonnage one needs, not marginal land and certainly not mountain land. In this country, we have designated mountains where one cannot sow a tree but it may be helpful to do so. The trees may not be as good. They may be twisted a bit but they may reduce some carbon. We need to wake up from the dream of where we are and the myth that we are going wrong with them. After we bring in all this stuff from America and are burning palm kernels from South Africa, I heard a Minister come out discussing agri-land or such today to say we are going to get rid of Johnny down the country who, 100 yards from his land, is cutting the five or ten hoppers of turf for his fireplace. We should learn from history about trying to take on the ordinary domestic turf cutter, not a commercial one but someone who does it for his or her own fire. I look at what we will do in America which with a big ship we will bring to Ireland, while we are going to tell people in the country who are living on €12,000 to €15,000 in income that they cannot cut turf, including many pensioners. We tell them we will give them a grant. I rang the Department of Rural and Community Development this evening to see what this grant was and if we had the details. The person in charge of it in the Department had been moved and there were no details about it. We are making announcements when there is no substance behind it. The Government should get one thing clear in its head that the 60 or 70 year old in the country or the person in socio-economically deprived areas will not listen to the codswallop coming out. We live in reality, not in fantasy. There might have been a battle over the last few years but with some of the stuff that has come out today, those people have bigger battles coming.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	395	Genuinely - I sound like Miriam O'Callaghan - I am very disappointed that we are having this debate on a night like this with so few Deputies to participate. I will make a proposal about that towards the end. I say that because I think it is unfortunate, as Deputy Ryan said, that we are having this discussion before the publication of the report and it is unfortunate that it is parked in the graveyard shift or whatever one calls this time on a Thursday night, because it is an important issue. I will repeat what others have said about the state we are in. We are the third highest producer of emissions per person in the European Union and ranked 49 out of 56 countries. It seems to me that our climate policy is to do nothing, to plead for special dispensations from the EU and to reduce any targets for emission reduction that we had aspired to. The Climate Change Advisory Council has already stated that we will not meet our 2020 targets, that the national mitigation plan will not result in decarbonisation and that we face, due to current emissions, fines in the region of €455 million or higher. Professor John Fitzgerald, who chairs the Climate Change Advisory Council says, "The plan has many ideas for action but it contains very few decisions". We have official policy, various statements, lofty declarations and we have various Bills and legislation that commit us to emission reductions and decarbonisation of the economy. We seem on paper to recognise the seriousness of the issue but then we have Government inaction, effectively doing nothing to reduce emissions and to switch our society from being fossil-fuel dependent to renewables. The much heralded renewable energy support scheme, when one unpicks it, is really about big business and what big business needs. It contains rhetoric about community involvement but specifically excludes microgeneration and small community groups, something that we should all acknowledge needs to happen if we are to have communities buy in to dealing with climate action, to overcome opposition and to make the kind of shifts that are needed away from fossil fuels. The fact that they are excluded tells us what is happening with our climate energy policy - we do not have one. The level of emissions rises or falls depending on the policy and the fluctuations in the market. We are not decarbonising. We are as dependent on fossil fuels as ever and we are as governed by the interests of the fossil fuel corporations as we have ever been. I genuinely think, the more I see of this place and talk to people, that the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and probably even the Minister, Deputy Ross, feel they have a commitment to climate change but I know they would acknowledge that the power of the fossil fuel industry is greater than the power they have as Ministers. The lobbying and power of the big fossil fuel corporations and their addiction to profit weighs down on all the policy-making of this Government. It is not only Ireland that is not responding to the facts of climate change. The whole world is in the same boat.For all of our conferences such as that in Bonn and all of our conferences of parties, COPs, and for all of the grand affairs at the United Nations, the globe is now emitting a greater volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere almost 30 years after Kyoto and decades after the science has been settled and we have known with certainty what will happen if we push the parts per million concentrations in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million. We have known and the scientific community has known the consequences. What have been the results of those three lost decades? We now stand at more than 400 parts per million. Those decades were lost in the fight against climate change because there was no fight. Instead, for a long time there was a denial industry and the consensus was to use market mechanisms to deal with it: carbon trading, offsets and bizarre schemes that suggested we in the West or in industrialised countries, if we were to continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, could plant some trees in a developing country or have schemes based on inventive or fraudulent accounting as to what could be taken out of the atmosphere and as to what we were pumping into it. All of these market mechanisms have failed, however. While companies and countries can pretend that they are dealing with it, the facts have stacked up and the levels of carbon dioxide have risen to historic levels. They are higher than they have been in the past 1 million years and the extremes of weather have continued to break all records. In the past 17 years, we have had the warmest 16 years on record. The extent and severity of droughts, heatwaves and storm intensity have all gathered apace. It is in the face of all those who say this is an intractable problem that we want to make a practical suggestion and we have already put a Bill before to the Dáil to address the question of the removal of fossil fuels from our shores. It is brilliant that we passed a Bill and have banned fracking and the extraction of fossil fuels on land in the Twenty-six Counties. However, there was a refusal to accept an amendment to the Bill which would have also included offshore fracking. Therefore, we are proposing a Bill to the House to include offshore. I will repeat what I said to the Minister, Deputy Naughten, when I told him it was hugely disappointing and almost like a kick in the teeth to discover that, as soon as we went on summer holidays, he announced the issuing of a licence for further exploration in the Porcupine Basin. I understand that there are another 11 licences for exploration of fossil fuels, gases and oils off our coast waiting to be issued. We were told by scientists in Bonn that the simple measure of Ireland, the pithy little country and all that it is, banning the extraction of further fossil fuels offshore would add greatly to the pressure on other countries and the industry generally around the globe. Two other countries are attempting to do the same. France is one of them. Deputy Eamon Ryan might help me with the other one. It is a small country.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	396	Costa Rica.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	France and Costa Rica are attempting to do the same. If the three of us managed to ban further extraction of fossil fuels, it would make a great contribution. The science tells us that 80% of the already recognised and known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground if we are to tackle climate change. To go digging for more would be an absolute catastrophe and would tie us in for another 40 or 50 years to fossil fuel addiction across Europe. I want to raise one other issue which has been brought to our attention repeatedly by the NGOs who are fighting the good fight to try to get us all to wake up and realise that a race for the future is going on here. Others have spoken about them and they include the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition and Trócaire. We are now in the process of building two large liquified natural gas terminals in the west and the south to act as conduits for fracked gas from North America, possibly the Alberta tar sands. It could end up being stored here and then piped over to the rest of Europe. This would see the largest remaining reserve of carbon dioxide on the planet being brought to the markets and the economies of western Europe. It is madness. It is absolute insanity. It treats natural gas as some kind of a transitional gas. Interestingly, I had this conversation with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, recently and he acknowledged that the gas companies try to present themselves as green. They say gas is green and that we should use it because it is lovely. We get the same sense from the advertising and encouragement to use natural gas of the companies that run it in this country. There is nothing green about it. It is a fossil fuel and the use of it and the infrastructure that we are building around the coast will lock us in for another 30, 40 or 50 years to a continued reliance on carbon dioxide, when what we need to be doing is keeping fossil fuels in the ground. I think it was Deputy Fitzmaurice, although it may have been one of the Sinn Féin Deputies, who spoke about paying farmers not to grow any more beef. That is also completely inaccurate. The biggest beef farmers in this country, the likes of Goodman and Bruton, are the ones that are pushing for the major export deals with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Middle East. We are growing more cattle now to export live to those countries. These countries never ate beef or dairy and had a much healthier diet than we do, but they are now being encouraged to take this on and we are growing that beef here, adding to our emissions. Our experience in Bonn was very interesting. I thought I would find it a cynical exercise but I learned hugely from it. I learned that, despite the emergency of thousands of companies which have original and inventive ways of dealing with and promoting renewable energy and of extracting from air, sea, wind and, in particular, solar power, there were many companies that were prepared to work with others and to sell and promote their products to tackle the question of climate chaos. However, the problem is that the elephant in the room was never mentioned. It was not mentioned at our interparliamentary meeting and it was not mentioned when the question was discussed with the people at stands. The elephant in the room is the giant corporations of Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP and all of the giant fossil fuel corporations across the globe who wield the power and have the money. They control whole economies and countries and wield the power and, I believe, really influence what happens in this State. We have a crucial role in fighting climate change by achieving that one small measure of keeping liquified natural gas in the ground. Similar to being the first to promote a vote on gay marriage, we can be the first to promote the banning of further exploration. We could stop those liquified natural gas terminals being built and promoted on our coast. We could revolutionise the unrolling of renewables, making sure that communities and micro-projects were encouraged to buy into the grid and put those projects and communities, and not big business, at the heart of our revolution. The market is the problem and not the solution. In dealing with climate change, the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who I am looking directly at now, in his role as Minister with responsibility for transport, has to recognise that competition in the market for running buses and trains will not deal with the problem. We need public transport to be just that - public - and for it to be run in the public interest and not in the interests of private companies who will compete with each other and tender for routes. Rather than pumping all our resources into building more motorways, we should be increasing the level of our PSO services and have a fully funded, growing and ever better public transport system that will take cars off the road. I admit that kind of spending would be a lot. However, today we discussed at length the question of PESCO. I will repeat it just for the sake of driving myself mad if not the everyone else. Overnight we can join a defence force in Europe that brings us from spending €900 million on our defence budget to between €3 billion and €4 billion. Overnight we seem to be able to do it. We have no problem signing up to it. It is being shoved down the throats of Deputies in this Dáil that this is the only way to go and we have to have it in. Where do we find that kind of money to spend on weapons of war, destruction and death? Instead could we spend it on something positive for the planet such as renewable energies or bringing public transport up to scratch to take cars off the road. That sort of mechanism will not happen because the market will not allow it. We should listen to the slogan of those who marched in Bonn at the climate change conference: "System Change, Not Climate Change." They also advocated, and I believe it is absolutely true, that capitalism is completely incompatible with climate justice. To come to my proposal, the Citizens' Assembly, as it did with the eighth amendment, has done an amazing job in its consideration of climate change. Stop Climate Chaos Coalition stated that its 13 recommendations on the State's action on climate change included common sense, practical proposals that address many of the areas raised by the coalition. It continued that, most important, the recommendations indicate that the Irish public is prepared to back immediate and strong action to tackle climate change and that the Government now, given the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, has the political mandate to implement new and effective policies urgently and ensure the weaknesses of the national mitigation plan are overcome. My proposal is that we do the same with the 13 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly as we did with its 13 recommendations on the eighth amendment. I propose that we establish a special committee to consider them. It should be an all-party, cross-party Oireachtas committee that would meet in special sessions over a number of months, take each recommendation seriously, call and examine witnesses, ask who else would like to attend and begin to draw up a serious plan that we can implement. Too often, climate change is the last thing we talk about, or it is spoken about on the Thursday night graveyard shift. Alternatively, we are told we cannot talk about the mitigation plan until after the reports are published. I seriously propose that we set up a special Oireachtas committee to consider the outcome of the Citizens' Assembly deliberations on climate chaos.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	Ireland made a commitment at the Paris climate change conference in November 2015 to provide at least €175 million in public funding in support of climate action in developing countries between 2016 and 2020. Since then, our State, acting in its function as a tax haven, has robbed multiples of this amount from the developing countries. Even with conservative estimates of the tax treatment of Irish investors in developing countries, Christian Aid says they constitute inflows to Ireland of approximately two to four times the size of the Irish aid budget. Any Minister who boasts about Ireland's movement on climate-justice aid should take time to consider the ongoing robbery. Recently, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, stated in reply to a question from Deputy Catherine Connolly that his Department could consider investing in light rail only if there were a business case for it. The idea that there is no business case for investment in light rail in Ireland is a bit mad. Climate change is on the march and the effects are already costing the State millions of euro. As we spend our time looking at the potential for short-term returns on public infrastructure projects, climate change will cost us an increasing amount in financial terms and human lives destroyed. The idea that the State should operate like a private for-profit entity may be a central tenet of neoliberalism, which has facilitated the advance of the climate change disaster to the point it is at today. The planet is not solely a resource to be abused for profit, no matter what the consequences. If the State acted in the public good, it would not let short-term profit-and-loss sheet analysis decide whether to invest in something that will save lives. The print in the Minister's script is pretty small. Perhaps it is that way so I cannot not read it or perhaps I jneed to get glasses; I am not sure. I do not see the phrase "light rail" in the script. This country needs to start considering light rail. I realise that if one produces a cost-benefit analysis, one concludes it is really too expensive in the short term. That is true but what is meant by the short term? We are talking about the long-term life of the planet and quality of life thereon so if we are to continue to deal in short-term economics, we will not really move to a different perspective on how we should challenge climate change. Things will not change a whole lot. It is seriously damning that we are now considered the worst in Europe at dealing with climate change and in how we dealt with it over the years. If nothing changes and if we just keep going along with short-term thinking, based on what we believe we can afford, things will not be done very much differently. We are finding money to increase our defence expenditure and we found multiple billions of euro to bail out useless banks but we seem to struggle to borrow money to do what I propose. We can borrow money at a rate of 1%. The Minister says it goes on the books. Can Europe actually help us in dealing with climate change? Can it allow us to borrow money for investment in infrastructure? It would be in the public interest and a great idea all round. Why are we not allowed to borrow money at a rate of less than 1% to invest in infrastructure? If Europe actually cared about how this country will develop, and if it really cared about our dealing with climate change, would it not afford us some financial flexibility with regard to infrastructural investment? That is not so mad.

I will. The agriculture sector is stuck with the same profit-before-people logic. The lies and spin surrounding the discussion of agriculture's emissions problem are becoming farcical. On 8 November, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine told me I was wrong in my view that emissions from agriculture were on the rise and that, in fact, between 1990 and 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector reduced by 5.5%. According to the EPA, emissions from agriculture in 2016 were 3.5% below their 1990 levels but they increased in four out of the past five years, namely in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. If the Food Wise programme continues, we will see an increase next year and in the two following years. The IFA is going around peddling the lie that there has been a 6% reduction since 1990 but what it and the Minister are omitting is that the EPA's figures are gleaned using the 2006 guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A project sponsored by the NASA Carbon Monitoring System research initiative has found that global livestock methane emissions for 2011 are 11% higher than the estimates based on guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2006. The EPA, IFA and the Minister may all have differing versions next year. Last week, the Taoiseach said that Irish beef production is more carbon efficient than beef production in South America and that we should not displace production to other countries that are less carbon efficient. This argument sidesteps the fact that we have not a chance in hell of achieving climate change mitigation if we do not dramatically cut down on the amount of meat that we eat globally. If we keep consuming meat as we are, we will not solve the climate change problems. That is a fact of life. The Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, may shake his head all he likes. I know only too well that it is madness to even challenge the agriculture sector about anything it does. I am actually as fond of agriculture as any of those opposite but I do believe we need a different approach.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	A recent study from the European Parliament examined average agricultural greenhouse gas production in the EU between 2012 and 2014. The data collected reflect how much agricultural output, valued in euro, is generated for every tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted. The best-performing country in the European Union, Italy, achieved some €1,700 of agricultural output per tonne of emissions. Ireland, the worst-performing country in the EU 28, achieved less than €400 of agricultural output per tonne of carbon emitted. How bad is that? This study was based on the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines that have been shown by NASA to be wrong as they dramatically underestimated the amount of emissions coming from the beef and dairy sectors.The lies being told to protect this incredibly destructive sector must stop before we can have an honest discussion about climate change. Ireland has done next to nothing to reduce its emissions, the proof being the 3.5% increase last year. While Ministers plea for a special case and complain along with the farming lobby about the Green Party signing us up to unachievable targets, other countries are making the transition. The Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour parties sat on their hands for years. We only produced the legislation in 2015, eight years after we signed up to the greenhouse gas reduction programme. There was nothing in the legislation. It kicked the can down the road for two years and contained no reference to targets. We had no national climate change strategy at all between 2012 and earlier this year when the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Naughten, published a mitigation plan An Taisce dubbed as an unmitigated disaster. The elephant in the room, along with the cow, is power generation. Scotland has increased its power generation from renewable sources from 20% in 2009 to 43% in 2015. In Ireland, in 2015 a total of 8% of energy was from renewable sources. The small amount of extra energy coming online from renewable sources will all be eaten up by the data centres that will be built here in the next five years. In effect, we are in a bad place and jogging to stand still. That means all the talk of electric cars is not what it is built up to be until we address how we produce electricity. Are we going to switch from petrol and lethal Government-subsidised diesel to cars being powered by oil, gas, peat and coal and a tiny bit of renewables, some of which will be fake renewables? There has been much fanfare about the diversion of funds towards biomass but the reality is that biomass is dirtier than coal and far more carbon intensive than burning natural gas. I have raised those issues numerous times with the Minister, yet he is going to go along with the climate damaging policy. The European Environment Agency's scientific committee, the European Commission's joint research centre and the European Commission itself, among many others, have all observed the premise that biomass combustion does not result in carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is wrong. Similarly, the IPCC has pointed out that its approach of not accounting for biomass emissions in the energy cycle should not be interpreted as a conclusion about the sustainability or carbon neutrality of bioenergy. When one burns forests, the carbon dioxide is released instantaneously but the bogus argument from the biomass industry is that the CO2 will be captured again by forest growth but that process will take up to 50 years. This cycle is not something we can afford. We need to look at how our energy policy affects carbon dioxide levels now, not over a period of decades. The push towards biomass is industry-led and all over the world we are seeing power plants that were built to burn coal or peat being switched over to burning something else while the industry-concocted lie that it is green is shoved down our throats. In the UK, there have even been corruption scandals with the MP who chaired the all-party parliamentary group on biomass accepting tens of thousands of pounds in bribes and leisure trips to Miami from the biomass industry. In Ireland, the industry has secured millions in public subsidies. In the realm of transport, we are not doing much better. The Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Naughten, said last week that we are running a number of initiatives with the public and private sectors to convert from traditional fossil fuels to electric vehicles. That is not an accurate statement. The lack of public investment and progress on electricity grid and renewable technologies means that in Ireland electric cars run on fossil fuels. Let us add to that the fact that the electric car industry is dependent on child labour in the cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. The DRC supplies half of the world's cobalt at the moment and the entire process is mired in corruption, scandalous human rights abuses and the ongoing violence and warfare in the region which is not unconnected to the mineral wealth of the country. We have not begun to deal with the housing crisis in this country yet and it will probably get worse before it gets better. We have a growing population and there has been much talk of late about apartments being too expensive to build. We will have many more problems if we keep covering the country in concrete and keep building houses further away from where people work. If one goes anywhere in Europe, one will see apartments for people to live in cities. We have not done that nearly enough. I accept that the construction of apartments gives rise to many issues and that we must take a different approach but if we refuse to look at the long-term plans for how we supply housing in this country, we will make dealing with climate change even more difficult. There are added climate change costs attached to building homes further away from the centre of cities. People have to spend longer in cars and other forms of transport on their commute. Given that we are unlikely to build light rail soon, it is a serious issue. It is a no-brainer that we must think very differently about apartments. The big problem with apartments in this country is that they were not built for family living but that can be done. If it can be done in Europe, then we can do it. Apartments can be built for families. We just have not done it and unless we start to do it, we will add to our climate change problems.

I am delighted to see triúr Airí anseo. Tá súil agam go bhfanfaidh siad agus go mbeidh siad ag éisteacht. The issue of climate change is unavoidable. Whether we are discussing agricultural policy, methane emissions or the use of land for forestry, we simply cannot get away from this debate. I am aware that it one of those issues where there is deeply divided opinion not only on the alleged causes of climate change, but also on the proposed solutions. We know that in 2015 countries adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and its 17 sustainable development goals. In 2016, the Paris Agreement on climate change entered into force, addressing the need to limit the rise of global temperatures. Of course that was before the United States decided to re-evaluate its commitment to the Paris Agreement. According to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which consists of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Vincentian Congregation, the Daughters of Charity and the Sisters of the Holy Faith, the Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, represent a political, economic and social commitment for the world up to 2030. They establish a sustainable development agenda which can be defined as development that meets the needs of those in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to also meet their needs. In order for sustainable development to be achieved, three interconnected elements are required, namely, economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. Those are all noble goals and there is nothing in them that anyone could argue against. The difficulty is how we get there, and how we achieve the goals. In terms of the impact any proposed measures would have on our unique economy, the IFA has said that a new approach must be developed, one which puts food security and resource stresses such as water availability at the centre of agriculture's response to climate change. It also says that the agriculture sector must also receive full emission reduction credit for carbon sequestration activity in agricultural soils, forestry and bioenergy when emissions from the sector are being reported. What is deeply concerning to people in rural areas is how often they hear enormous passion and enthusiasm to address the perceived problems associated with climate change but so often that is at the expense of the rural way of life. That is almost always the case now. People in rural areas often feel that are being sacrificed without any consideration in order to achieve outcomes and goals relating to climate change which are contentious to say the least. In preparing for the debate, I came across some interesting information which I am open to having corrected because one can only believe half what one sees and none of what one hears. It refers to the history of so-called climate tipping points. It is instructive in that it shows how the great sense of panic on the subject is often overstated. For example, as early as 1989 the UN was already trying to sell its tipping point rhetoric to the public.Then in 2007 the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chief declared 2012 as the climate deadline by which we had to act or it would be too late. I am told that, not to be outdone, the former President, Mary Robinson, weighed in this week issuing a more generous 20-year tipping point. After that, NASA got in on the act claiming that the climate tipping point was 2009. Indeed, NASA boss, James Hansen, declared that Obama had only his first term to save the planet. He has come and gone and he had a second term. In 2012 the UN gave Obama and the planet Earth another four-year reprieve. The former US vice president, Al Gore, also created a ten-year climate tipping point in 2006. Yet, it is more than ten years later and 2016 has come and gone but we are still around, thank God. What are we to make of all this? Is it not even remotely reasonable to raise questions on the matter when it appears that organisations like NASA and the United Nations have got it so completely wrong in terms of so-called climate tipping points? I am not for a moment suggesting that we need to take a cavalier attitude to the issue, but we must listen to the debate. We should not simply demonise those who may have different perspectives on nature and the causes and proposed solutions. I see the Minister and the two Ministers of State across the floor. I could call them the three amigos or the three stooges – I do not know what I will call them. Anyway, it is good to see them here listening so late in the night.

I did not intend it in that way; I only intended to be jocose. I was not trying to have a go at them either. Unfortunately, there is a problem with carbon credits in agriculture, as Deputy Fitzmaurice and others have said. This relates to where people are putting in afforestation. They are not allowed keep the credits. Big business has come in and farmers are not allowed get carbon credits on their land. There are parts near where I live in extreme south Tipperary and west Waterford where we have the hen harrier. We have land that cannot be touched or drained. A farmer cannot cut a rush in it. A friend of mine made me two rattles for a little baby recently from rushes from a bog in west Cork. They were works of art. I only got them last night. I should have brought them in and rattled them here. It would have woken us all up. Anyway, he made them from rushes but we cannot even do that in the land where the hen harrier is. We cannot drain it, graze it or plant it. It is useless. We have to be careful what we are at. His eminence, Pope Francis, is concerned about climate change. My erstwhile colleague, who is not here tonight, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, is fundamentally opposed to his views. We had an interesting meeting one night in the residence of the former Papal Nuncio. While driving up to the gate, Deputy Healy-Rae said that he did not know what the man wanted from him because he did not agree with his boss. I did not twig for a while what he was going on about, but that is a story for Teachta Danny Healy-Rae. As I said, we must listen. He has issued several encyclicals on the matter as well. There are 2 million people working in Ireland. We boast everyday about all the people back in work. The quantity and quality of the jobs might be often considered a strain. Anyway, those people have to travel to work. How are we going to take away all the cars? In fairness, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, met a group from my constituency to discuss electrification of buses and electric buses. We must look at all those situations and examine them. We have not got it. The Minister, Deputy Ross, is introducing a Bill in the House tomorrow. I will be back here especially to challenge the Minister robustly on it. It is affecting rural Ireland. Where is the rural proofing in this legislation? Where is the rural proofing in the legislation before the House tomorrow? It is not there. Rural Ireland is dead and gone. Who is it with in the grave? I cannot think of the poet.

That is what the Government wants: nothing in rural Ireland, a wasteland. We have announcement after announcement here and there about this, that and the other. The Minister can smile and laugh all he likes. We have the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for greyhounds and horses and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Anyway, we need to have joined-up thinking. We need to allow our people to work. We are not going to get back to the comely maidens dancing at the crossroads. That was a time when they all had to cycle to work on penny farthing bikes. That is what the Government is going to reduce rural Ireland to if it is not careful. We are not going to take all the blame for all the climate change. I look forward in particular to the contribution of Deputy Ryan afterwards. His mother or grandmother came from Tiobraid Árann - he often tells me that. Deputy Ryan should think about Tipperary and rural Ireland and the rural economy. One in seven of the jobs are in agriculture. We cannot banish all of agriculture. What about cutting the turf? My goodness, was it ever cut? It was a good pastime, a healthy recreation and part of our heritage and culture. The Government wants to stop the ordinary man going out to cut a little turf to heat and warm himself. The Government wants to pay people to stay at home and do nothing and give them the fuel allowance. Is that what the Government wants? It is totally anti-God, anti-nature, anti-health and anti-everything to be sitting for that long with everything going up the chimney. Since he got bad summers, the farmer will not be able to dry enough turf. Even if he turns it two or three times, it will not burn for him. Anyway, he is entitled to do that. It is part of his heritage and culture, as it was for many generations before him. They should be allowed to continue it. Is it like Cromwell – to hell or to Connacht? The Government will not even leave them in Connacht now. My good friend beside me is from Connacht. The Government wants to send them all overseas and export them. Bord na Móna has 1,600 jobs, many of which are in my county. We are going to lay them all off. The plan is to go to biomass and ship it in here. In the name of God, the lunatics are running the asylum by bringing up this legislation. They are going to ship it in here and then burn it. However, we know it is difficult to burn anyway. I do not know where the Government is coming or going from. Thanks to Deputy Fitzmaurice, an email came in to me this evening. It was from the Irish Farmers' Journal. I imagine he will get it up on the screen of his iPad. It is a photograph of a horse and a tractor and plough. The EU is now going to tell us what way to plough the field and what direction we should go. Next thing, they will have us back with the horse and plough. They will have us tied on. We will be pulling the plough. We will not even be allowed the horse in case he breaks wind and causes emissions. We are gone stark raving mad. They want to tell us what way to plough the field and what direction we should plough the field. What kind of fields are there in Donegal? I am unsure whether the Minister, Deputy Ross, can see any fields where he lives. Anyway I know the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is a tillage farmer. I am unsure what is going on over in Galway, but, my God, it is madness to tell anyone what way to plough the field and in what direction. It is no wonder we have Brexit. We will have more Brexit. We might want an Irish exit, Irexit. It is scandalous. I have the photograph before me. The Deputies should look at it. There is a nice sod turned. It was taken during the ploughing match. It is a little crooked. It was a Ford with a reversible plough. Now, those in the EU in Brussels dictate what direction fields are ploughed. I rest my case. It is madness. The lunatics are not only running the asylums but they are running this place as well. As I said, this legislation and all the announcements are crazy. It is a pity the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, is gone. I salute him for some of the efforts he has made. He is trying some initiatives, but it is all too little too late. We have let the madness into the machinery of State. There is brainwave after brainwave. However, once the EU says something like that, our own geniuses tell us that we cannot plough the fields at all and that we must spray them and leave them as wasteland. We pay people to leave them idle, like with the set-aside scheme. It is madness of the highest degree. There is serious cause for concern. We must listen and pay our fair share but we must not blame the people of rural Ireland. We need electric buses and electric cars, but until some of these initiatives are rolled out, Paddy, Mary and Tommy must go to work. They want to work. Jimmy and Nelly must go to the bog and cut the turf. They can have the tea in the bog and have a large bath when they come home. They cannot have two baths until tomorrow. The Minister will tell them they are not allowed to have two or they will be arrested and locked up forever. The people of rural Ireland are being terrorised with intimidating legislation. None of it is rural-proofed or rural-assessed. None of it is financial-proofed. None of it is understood. None of it is even meaningful. It is a sad day when we are dishing out all this legislation day after day here. We are simply churning it out and creating so much paper. What about all the carbon credits for all the paper that is wasted on initiatives? The members of the Cabinet should have a serious think. The Minister may go away to meet the rest of the Cabinet tonight. They might have a Cabinet dinner. The Minister, Deputy Ross, should go and meet them and talk to them. They can carry on being merry and to hell with the people of rural Ireland.

Those of us who were committed to it spent countless meetings defending our positions on platform after platform. We were bushwhacked by the Opposition at the time. There is not much sense in the Opposition coming along now and saying there has been insufficient progress. In fact, they impeded the progress. They shut it down at every opportunity. There are three ways alternative energy can be effectively and efficiently provided in this country. I should mention as well, incidentally, that wood is neutral is so far as carbon is concerned.It is carbon neutral and only exudes the amount of carbon that it absorbed in the first place, no more or less. One grows a tree to replace a tree and one contributes nothing to the carbons.  Wind energy is the most efficient, effective and reliable way to generate electricity. It is as simple as that and the sooner we recognise that, the better. I tried to point this out to people all over the country for the past four or five years and no one wanted to listen. When will people listen? They will do so when the fines come down the track because fines will be effective. People told me in the past that we would not pay any fines but that is a matter beyond our control.  Solar panels can be installed effectively on marginal land. A grid is needed to allow suppliers of electricity to link into it because wind does not blow in the same place all the time. It may not be blowing in one place but it will be blowing five, ten or 100 miles away. The grid must be sufficient to ensure continuity of supply.  We need, as a matter of urgency, to concentrate on developing eco-friendly generation of electricity. In addition to solar and wind power, another option is hydro-generation. We are limited in what we can do in this area unless we flood valleys and so on.  It is critical to remember that we do not need to be pessimistic. However, we will need to be pessimistic if we continue to engage in obstruction every time we get a chance to provide an alternative. We either have one or the other as otherwise we will have to put up with the consequences. 
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	428	Climate change is a difficult issue in a range of ways. It is difficult because of the scale of the challenge and also because the scale of the change is so immense that we speak of the issue in terms of a geological timeframe, although we are speeding it up. People joked and laughed at the then President Obama when he said he wanted to stop the seas rising but that is what we have to do and it will not be easy. We in the environmental movement - I count myself among its members - may need to think about our approach. We have known the science for a long time and maybe we have scared people and made them feel guilty without giving them a sense of empowerment. Rather than telling people what to do, perhaps we should start asking for their help. Perhaps we must admit uncertainty because we do not know all the precise solutions. While the science is absolutely clear regarding the threat and reality of climate change, we are not certain of where the tipping points lie and when we will cross over into runaway destructive climate change.  We know what we have to do, namely, decarbonise the entire economy within the next three decades. We must achieve 100% decarbonisation, not the 80% set out in the Bill. This is what is provided for in the Paris climate agreement to which we signed up and it is what science says we must do.  There are some signs of hope and the task is not impossible. Global emissions have started to stabilise in recent years, China has started to burn less coal and India is turning to solar power. In addition, the Internet and digital technologies are driving efficiencies, leading to energy savings and emissions reductions. The scary thing, however, is that this year, while emissions stabilised, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased. There is a fear that we may be approaching one of the tipping points at which the natural systems are no longer able to store the carbon we have been producing. We must, therefore, take dramatic action and do so quickly.  As I stated, we have known about this issue for a long time. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was written 25 years ago when the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was 359 parts per million. Today, it stands at 407 parts per million and is rising by approximately three parts per million every year. This rise must stop, which requires a large-scale response and immediate change.  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to Dr. James Hansen who is one of the best scientists on climate. He estimated that if we had started addressing climate change in the early 1990s, we would have had to achieve an annual reduction in global emissions of approximately 2%. If we had started to act in 2005, Dr. Hansen estimates that the required annual reductions in global emissions would have been approximately 3.5%. Now, according to Dr. Hansen, because we have not taken action in the past 25 years, the reduction required is of the order of 6% per annum. This presents an incredible challenge, albeit one I believe we can meet. It is not too late but the longer we delay, the worse the problem will be. I regret that the Minister, Deputy Ross, has just left the Chamber because I was keen to point out to him that one of the reasons we must act now is that if we do not build the infrastructure needed for the low carbon world that is emerging, we will build the wrong infrastructure. The national planning framework is completely flawed in terms of the importance it attaches to the issue of climate. It does not propose any change in the way we will build for the future but continuing with the construction of inter-urban motorways as if this approach will work in terms of reducing emissions and the congestion that dogs the country. We must act now to provide the appropriate infrastructure because a new industrial revolution is taking place. As I stated, there is hope and change is taking place across the world, as people switch to new, renewable systems and there are, at last, signs that an alternative, low carbon transport system is possible. In all likelihood, it will run on electricity. However, the alternative also includes a return to urban environments in which we reduce the dominance of the car. This would have all sorts of benefits. As a country which missed out on the first industrial revolution, why would we choose to miss out on the new, clean industrial revolution that is taking place? That is the path we are choosing, however.  We must also change the economy by shifting from the unjust corporate controlled system. The transition of which I spoke presents us with an opportunity to do so. We must make the leap to a different and better model, restore ownership, where we can, to the local level. This also means we must continue to work globally because this is a global problem. We have to co-operate with China, the United States, Africa, the rest of Europe and everywhere else in the world because this issue involves every country. It must, however, be based on switching not only to a clean but also a socially just economy. The trade unions know this is necessary. They are correct that there are no jobs on a dead planet. They recognise the reality and want to be part of a just transition in order that we can make a social, as well as environmental switch. The benefit of tackling this problem would not only be in the area of emissions. It would also address the problem of air pollution, which is causing asthma in children and causing heart and lung problems in the wider populations. Almost one third of the solutions to which we can turn in this country involve changes to the natural environment that deliver other environmental benefits in protecting biodiversity, improving the water supply and helping to prevent flooding. Making this switch would deliver a myriad of advantages.  As I stated, we need to make a shift in our urban areas. There is a logjam in the system, which is not working. If we are to build the houses we desperately need, we must do so in an urban environment that is clean, green, social and not dominated by the car. What is wrong with doing that? Why would we not set such an objective or seek to achieve that gain?  Last but not least, the transition of which I speak will be good for rural Ireland. I attended an event last night at which we discussed the development of community. It was a tough discussion because some of those present related difficult stories about what is happening in their communities. The toughest story was told by a young woman from Leitrim who said she did not want to go home and had not been home to visit her parents for a year because there was not enough life at home. There was no excitement, activity, jobs or young people and no broadband or connectivity. We have to address this issue and in addressing our carbon emissions, we will return life to rural Ireland. That is where the employment and new energy supplies will be located. It is also where we can get higher quality food that brings life back to these communities. This is not just about narrow economics. It is also about a sense that every village and every town can and has to play its role. This belongs to everyone as a challenge because it is so big. Therefore, that village in Leitrim is just as important as downtown Dublin, New York or Shanghai. We all have to play our part in this transition such is the scale of the change that has to be made. This is a cultural transition. It is, and it is difficult to use this word in this House because one never mixes the two, a "spiritual" transition we need to make. It is, as Pope Francis and the Eastern Patriarch Bartholomew stated, a massive leap or transition to make where we put ecological and social thinking at the heart of everything, including our churches. That is what we need to do. Why are we not doing it? Some say we were too ambitious when we were in government and that has caused the problem. I am sorry, I beg to differ. My experience in government was a positive one that one could effect change. Emissions, around the time we were involved in government, went down 15%. I accept half of it, or slightly more, was probably to do with the recession, but the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, made an assessment that half of it was due to the fact that at that time there was political commitment in government behind the change. We can do this. My experience is when we get the State together, and get the agencies in behind it, we have European regulations backing us and that is possible. That is happening again now. Europe is turning to this again as a priority just at the time when the Government is there negotiating. I regret also that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is not here because his officials are still in Brussels this week. In every file, they state the EU should step back as Ireland does not want to take an ambitious path. That is the reality of what is happening, as we speak, this week. Some say we cannot do it because China and America are not doing it. China is doing it. They are doing it because they know this is the new industrial revolution and they want to get ahead in that. Europe is starting to wake up to that and Europe will challenge it. Even President Trump in office will not stop America making this transition because in California, in Massachusetts, in Florida, and in all the innovative centres in America they realise this transition is the way forward and they are investing in it. The technological centres of the world, such as California, China and Germany, are all going in that direction. We want to opt out. I have to ask why. It is not too late for many who might turn to that view, because the more emissions we have, the higher the temperature and the worse it will be. The more we can restrict this, the less damage that will be done. It is never too late. The opportunity is there. We need to start with oil and gas. The Taoiseach stated the other day that we will always need oil and gas. Eighty per cent of the known reserves in the world will have to remain in the ground if we are to avoid going over those tipping points into dangerous runaway climate change. The latest analysis we got in Bonn was that even the existing production line from oil, gas and coal will not be able to be used. We do not need any more oil and gas and we should be turning to renewables. This Government has set a target for 2030 of 40% of energy through renewables. It is clear, even while the technology is uncertain and it is always difficult, that it has changed now. The certainty has come in recent years. The cost of renewables has come down. We could achieve 75% by 2030. There are all sorts of industrial benefits that would come from that, not only in the energy sector. It is mainly offshore wind and solar power, and it has to be solar on the roof first so that it is owned by the people and there is that social transition as well. Where is that in our statement? We need to make our homes warm and protect them. The Tipperary Institute did really good work around super homes, where we set an ambition for ten years' time to convert all those 1 million homes which currently have oil-fired central heating and poor insulation by installing exterior insulation, solar panels on the roof, electric heat pumps, electric vehicle, EV, connections and so on. It is not impossible. The technology exists. Many Irish companies are good at it. Why is that not being set as a statement of ambition tonight? I say yes to electric vehicles for rural Ireland. The easiest place to put electric vehicles will be at the one-off houses in the country. It is difficult in parts of Dublin because there are terraced houses and apartments. That is not the case in rural Ireland and that is the first place we should be putting them in. The range problem will not be an issue because as the volume of cars increases, the number of charging stations increases and the batteries improve. This is doable, it is clean and it provides a balance against the renewable power supply. This is the industrial revolution. We have to be good at it. We can be good at. EirGrid, our transmission company, is bloody good at it. It is cheaper.

The fuel costs are one fifth of an oil-fired car, and the maintenance costs are a fraction too because there are fewer moving parts. That is the reality of what has happened. We need to wake up to it. We need to invest in public transport and do what the Citizens' Assembly said. The Citizens' Assembly's work was superb in terms of saying the Government needs to show leadership. An official from the Department there asked what can the citizens do for us on this and they came right back and stated it was rather that they need to know what the Government can do for the citizens on this and it can start by switching the transport budget towards public transport and by investing in cycling to create these urban spaces that really work. We also need a land use plan for this country. We need a big vision. We need to listen to what the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, stated on Monday-----

The Minister of State knows Europe is changing on this. He knows the future payments in CAP will go for those who protect biodiversity, who store carbon and who help us protect water supplies. Let us go for it. Let us not see this as a rural-urban divide because it is not so. The only way this will work for us as a country, if we are to make this leap, is if we do it collectively. When we do that, when we act in concert, when we act in a co-ordinated way, we are a really capable country. At present, we are in the doghouse on this issue because there is no political will. There is an utter lack of leadership in government and that needs to change.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	As the Minister of State, Deputy English, will be aware, unfortunately, another homeless person died in Cork in recent days. This is the second such death in the city. Another lady was found deceased in a tent in September. In the lead-up to Christmas, much of the focus has been on the number of people who are homeless in the Dublin region and I wanted to try to get some sense of what the winter plan for the Cork area will be. Some of the agencies in Cork are working flat out. Simon is making available an additional 47 spaces, not in bed spaces but by opening up their day care centres for the night-time where people can sleep on floors. Even at that, it is not meeting the demand in the city at present. Last night I spoke to a number of volunteers who go out every night. We have a number of groups in Cork which do homeless soup runs and they bed down people, and they say that to meet the demand over the coming weeks to ensure that nobody is on the streets of Cork, we need an additional 20 bed spaces opened as a matter of priority. I do not know what the plan is for the region in the coming weeks and maybe the Minister of State can outline that tonight to us, but there is a lot of anger in Cork today following the death of Kathleen. The reality is she tried to get into a hostel and she was unable to get into one. She was told to come back later when they could see what space was available. The doorway she passed away in is the very same doorway her aunt passed away in seven years ago. This is not a new issue in the city. That family has now been touched by tragedy on two occasions and they have to pick up the pieces again. Volunteers in Cork want to express the need for additional bed spaces. There is a perception, and a genuine feeling on the ground among the volunteer groups which are working in the area, that much of the focus has been on the Dublin area.That is understandable in light of the number of people who are homeless in Dublin. However, Cork also has a homelessness problem and is trying to deal with it. I am not criticising anybody in the area. All of those involved are doing their best, including the local authority, the statutory agencies and the volunteer groups, but there are just not enough emergency beds available. I understand why some people might be turned away from emergency accommodation. They might be too intoxicated or they might be aggressive when they arrive. However, turning them away and making them sleep in doorways is not the answer. Perhaps the Minister will outline what plan there is for the next couple of weeks to ensure that nobody in Cork is obliged to sleep in a doorway.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	I thank Deputy O'Brien for raising this issue. He did so in a genuine manner. He is right that it is important to recognise that the homelessness and rough sleepers difficulty exists not only in Dublin, where the main media concentration is, but also outside. We are aware of that in the Department because we are involved in providing the services on a nightly basis. I accept that the Deputy is genuinely trying to bring a focus to this. My Department and I learned of the sad death yesterday of a woman in Cork city who was availing of homelessness services. This death is a tragedy for the woman's family and friends and I extend our sympathies to them. Clearly, this is a very difficult time for those involved. Out of consideration for the families, I ask that we respect their privacy and not speculate on the circumstances of the deceased or the cause of death at this time. However, I will check out the Deputy's comment that she had sought to get into a hostel but was not facilitated. I will try to find out the reasons for that and, if possible, deal with it. Of course, while it is not appropriate to speculate on the circumstances of an individual case, it is absolutely right that we should discuss the issue of homelessness and, more specifically, highlight the actions that are under way to support those who are sleeping rough at this time. If there are gaps in the service we should close them. That is something the Deputy tried to highlight tonight. There is a suite of State-funded support services available to homeless persons nationally, including in Cork city. Cork City Council makes every possible effort on an ongoing basis to ensure there is sufficient emergency accommodation available to those who need it. We have been clear to all local authorities that there must be enough beds, both temporary and emergency, to provide for people in these winter conditions. It is something the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was clear about a number of months ago. Cork City Council's cold weather strategy for homeless persons has been in effect since 1 November. This strategy ensures that additional temporary shelter can be brought into use across existing services to ensure that there is sufficient available accommodation this winter. At present, there are over 130 hostel type beds available for homeless adults in Cork city. This includes the additional capacity that is currently available under the city council's cold weather strategy. I understand that, typically, Cork city has less than ten rough sleepers on a given night. Beds are available for these individuals should they wish avail of them and outreach teams continue to work to try and provide solutions for such individuals and to encourage them to avail of accommodation. The Deputy has provided data tonight indicating that the figure is approximately 20. We will have to check our figure and update it because we are clear that we wish to ensure there is enough accommodation for anybody who needs it. As the Deputy said, there is no reason anybody should have to be a rough sleeper and remain on the streets at night, certainly in these weather conditions. That is our aim and that is what we provide resources for through the various mechanisms. In addition to the hostel type beds, the city council is also funding the Simon Community to provide a night haven service from its facility on Anderson's Quay. This service, which is available throughout the winter period, provides supervised space in which up to 15 people who would not normally access services can spend the night if they choose. At the housing summit held last September, the Minister and I emphasised the need for all housing authorities to have sufficient capacity in emergency accommodation and appropriate facilities in place for every person sleeping rough on any night of the week. This is something we did last year as well. Generally, the assessment involves discussions with the various agencies on the ground over the months leading up to winter and Christmas. I hope we have provided enough accommodation but, if not, we will have to add to it. In response to the housing summit, the key urban housing authorities where rough sleeping arises have put their cold weather strategies in place and some of them, including in Dublin, are rolling out additional beds. Government policy on homelessness recognises that the provision of long-term secure housing, with support as needed to ensure sustainable tenancies, is the key solution to ending homelessness. While all homeless people have a need for stable housing, homelessness is complex and a variety of other supports can be required to meet individual needs. Many homeless people, particularly those who are rough sleeping, have complex health and social care needs, including in respect of addiction and mental health issues, which require care and supports beyond the provision of accommodation via the housing authority.

I agree with the Deputy that we must ensure the different types of accommodation cater for the need. I was at the Dublin Simon Community facility a few days ago where its personnel meet people who present with different needs and can cater for them.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	I do not wish to be argumentative with the Minister of State about the figures but the figure he quoted is simply not correct. There are more than ten rough sleepers in Cork at night. That is a fact. I am aware that the Simon Community has opened a facility and I have said that it is working at capacity. The city council is doing everything possible. I am not criticising anybody but it is simply not true to say that there is an emergency bed available for every rough sleeper in Cork city. If that was the case, we would not have people sleeping on the streets. I am aware, from personal experience, that some individuals who may be able to avail of a bed choose not to do so for personal reasons. If somebody has come out of addiction and is clean that person will be very slow go into an environment where there is drug use. I agree that it is necessary not just to make beds available but to examine the types of beds being made available. We cannot continue to state that there is a bed for everyone who wishes to avail of one because it simply is not true. The Minister of State can visit Cork on any night. We are discussing people who are rough sleepers tonight, but I know people who are homeless and are squatting. They are in a building at night and have some type of roof over their heads, but they are still homeless. If they are kicked out of the squat for some reason - and the majority of the squats are run down, dilapidated buildings - they will end up on the streets that night. I ask the Minister of State to meet the agencies in Cork because the figures he is being given are not correct.

The Minister could not be any clearer about this. He has repeatedly said in the House that when it comes to the emergency provision of housing, and we know that it is not a permanent solution, he has asked the local authorities to ensure there is a bed available for anybody who wants it. The Deputy is correct that in some cases people cannot avail of it for whatever reason.

I am just saying that the information we received does not match that of the Deputy. I am willing to have that checked out because we are clear that we wish to be able to say with confidence where we know we have a bed available for everybody. I monitor the Dublin situation closely. We are able to track the beds that are available every night, so I am clear about that. I do not have all the figures for Cork for every night of the week but I have been told that the average is ten. I will have that checked. The Minister could not have been clearer about this. I sat beside him when he told the local authorities that, under the winter initiative, it is essential that there are beds available. We know that in extreme weather conditions, such as those that will occur tonight and tomorrow night, people who do not usually avail of services will come forward and use them. That is also a chance to help them and perhaps save them by making other services available to them in the long term. We want to be in a position to have beds available. If they are not, I assure the Deputy that we will address the matter.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	Air Bound Trampoline Park in Dundalk is the latest revolution in sport and fitness for both children and adults. It is made up of hundreds of square metres of interlocking trampolines covering the floor space and going up the walls. This is a big attraction in Dundalk. It is a great way for families to come together and have fun while exercising. It also caters for children who have special needs. In this era of computers and play stations it is vital that organisations that promote exercise such as Air Bound Trampoline Park are supported by the Government. Last night, Air Bound Trampoline Park announced via its Facebook page that two years after opening its doors, it must close on Tuesday next, 12 December, just before Christmas. This will affect the 15 members of staff and their families because they will now be unemployed. The reason is that the trampoline park simply cannot get insurance. There are ten insurance claims against the park in the past two years, seven of which arise from a jump tower which was in place in the company's first year of business. It has been closed since last February.I received a huge volume of phone calls from constituents in Dundalk asking me to help Air Bound. This morning I called to Air Bound to find that the management and staff are simply gutted that it has come to this. They have been in contact with the insurance company for over three months, trying to come to an arrangement, and now it will not even offer them a quote. I also received a phone call this morning from a parent who was very upset that Air Bound was due to close. Her daughter has dyspraxia and requires physiotherapy. She informed me that her daughter attends Air Bound three times per week. On Tuesday and Thursday evenings it offers a class for one hour, called fit camp, which is for all children, including those with special needs. On Friday evenings it has a class for children with autism and dyspraxia only. She told me that the service it offers has resulted in her daughter requiring less physiotherapy, and her social and sensory skills are improving, along with her overall health and fitness. She told me that the management and staff bend over backwards in assisting children with special needs and that it is affordable. It is no secret that I am a fan of fitness and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle - "your health is your wealth". I go to Air Bound most Saturday mornings with my two grandchildren. On a Saturday morning it offers what is called a toddler morning, which is for children under the age of five only. It has a great community spirit and offers a great chance for young children to interact with one another while having fun and exercising. Childhood obesity is currently a major problem in Ireland and it is vital that, as a Government, we promote heath and exercise for children. If this place is to close, it is the children who will lose out. When I visited Air Bound today, I was very annoyed to be informed that it has been advised that if the trampoline park was to relocate to Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland, it would receive insurance. I could not believe this was happening. This is a family business run by Gayle Maguire and her family, with a great staff, doing fantastic work for children with disabilities and not making it hard on their pockets. Thankfully, just this afternoon, with the help of Douglas Howell of Cullen Insurances in Newport, County Tipperary, we have secured insurance for Air Bound Trampoline Park. Fifteen jobs are safe as Air Bound is not closing, which is great news. The issue is that it is becoming nearly impossible to secure public liability insurance in Ireland. This is due to the lack of competition in the South of Ireland, which is not like the North. There seems to be a very narrow risk appetite in the South. The price differentials among insurers show that many insurers are offering different prices for different channels. This is confusing people and putting customers at a major disadvantage. Brokers in the North are providing choice and advice, whereas, in the South, there is a big push by insurers to go direct, which takes out the advice and makes it easier for insurers to turn down claims. Commercial business cannot be written in the South, which is resulting in a lot of Irish business now going to the UK, such as motor fleets.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for raising this very important Topical Issue matter and I am delighted to hear that matters have been rectified since it was put down today. Thankfully, the staff and management of Air Bound Trampoline Park have received good news, which is excellent, although I understand where the Deputy is coming from in terms of ensuring this sort of thing does not happen in the future. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael D'Arcy. It is important to be clear on the matter of responsibilities. The Minister for Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation. Neither he nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products. Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits member states from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis. As a result, the Minister for Finance is not in a position to intervene in the case of this or any company. It is also important to say in this instance that the type of activity conducted appears to be of a particularly risky nature and, therefore, requires the application of the highest possible safety standards at all times in order to avoid accidents and potential claims. Insurers will generally give some credit for such measures when making a decision to provide cover and at what price. In addition, while I have considerable sympathy for a company that finds itself in this position, I am strongly of the view that, while there is no statutory requirement to have a minimum level of public liability insurance cover, it would be unwise to conduct any type of business in its absence. That said, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy D’Arcy, in their roles in financial services and insurance are aware of recent problems in regard to the provision and price of insurance for businesses generally. Indeed, that is why the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which was established by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and which is currently chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, chose to examine the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors in its ongoing second phase, following the publication of the report on the cost of motor insurance in January of this year. Some of the issues which have been raised by businesses and other stakeholders consulted during this second phase include: the significant increase in the cost of employer liability and public liability insurance; the lack of competition in the employer liability and public liability insurance market; frustration with the inconsistency of personal injury awards; high costs in challenging claims through the court process; and the prevalence of fraudulent and exaggerated claims. The working group is currently in the process of finalising its second phase report on employer liability and public liability, which will follow a similar format to the report on the cost of motor insurance, and thus will include an action plan with associated actions and deadlines for implementation. The final report is expected to be submitted to the Minister for Finance for approval by the end of the year and subsequently published in January, following approval by Government. It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and co-operation from all relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objectives of delivering fairer employer liability and public liability premiums for businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market, without unnecessary delay. Finally, and notwithstanding the strict demarcation of responsibilities already referred to, Department of Finance officials today contacted Insurance Ireland in regard to the specific case which the Deputy has outlined. Insurance Ireland responded to confirm that it would be agreeable to engaging with the particular insurance provider concerned if all appropriate details could be submitted to it. In this regard, Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in regard to obtaining insurance, and the relevant contact details are on its website.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	445	I think the Minister of State is wrong. The leisure industry needs help. I am delighted to see the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in the Chamber. I would like to invite her to Dundalk to visit Air Bound Trampoline Park, which is doing a fantastic job. It is looking after children, including children with disabilities, it is helping to combat obesity and is helping people make their lives healthier and live longer. It is fantastic for getting families together. As I said, I go there with my two grandchildren most Saturday mornings when I am free. Even at my age, I can still enjoy the trampoline park. I would extend to the Minister a warm welcome to Dundalk and to Air Bound. It is vital that, as a Government, we address this issue. Insurance is becoming a huge issue in Ireland. Air Bound's previous insurer failed to even offer it a quote. Insurance companies' prices are rising for people on a daily basis. It seems highly unfair that they can raise a person's car policy in some cases by as much as 60% and then, on the other hand, refuse to even offer a company a quote. We need to put something in place now before more jobs are lost or companies simply decide to relocate 15 minutes up the road to the North of Ireland, where insurance companies are willing to play ball. Air Bound is doing everything right in regard to health and safety, risk assessment, checking equipment, training staff and improving services all the time. The injuries board is not fit for purpose. We have a lack of competition. We are trying to push insurance brokers out of the market although they are providing choice and advice, as we can see from Cullen Insurances helping to secure insurance to keep Air Bound open. Insurers are operating directly, which is making it easier for them to turn down claims. Let us call a spade a spade. Insurance companies of leisure businesses in Ireland are paying out higher claims than those in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This is something we have to look into - claims, claims, claims. Ireland has a name for high claims and it is something we will have to combat. I want to wish Gayle Maguire at Air Bound Trampoline Park and her staff all the best and thank her for providing a fantastic service for all the young and old in Dundalk and surrounding areas. I again thank Douglas Howell of Cullen Insurances for keeping a good business going and keeping its employees in employment.

It is great news for staff coming up to Christmas that it has been able to find this vital insurance. I will pass on the comments he has made to the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and I am sure he will also investigate the matter. I am not aware of the company, although it sounds a wonderful facility and important in terms of health and fitness, particularly in regard to its important work for those who suffer from autism or have other special needs. I can imagine it does an outstanding job and it is great, coming up to Christmas, that the staff and management have job security. The report on employer liability and public liability, which follows on from the previous report on the cost of car insurance, will be published once it is agreed by the Government early in the new year. The Government and the Oireachtas are acutely aware of issues of cost and competitiveness in terms of the claims culture and all that goes with it. It is wonderful news, and much better than when Deputy Fitzpatrick tabled this Topical Issue for debate earlier in the day-----

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	I am disappointed that the Minister announced the removal of the over-age exemption in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme from September 2018 onwards in respect of children with special needs. I am pleased that, presumably when she got notice of this debate and after a strong campaign by parents that garnered more than 20,000 signatures, she last night announced that she would be pressing the pause button to allow parents to be consulted before making her final decision. It is vital that all of our children have the best possible start in life and that the concerns of their parents be heard. More than 20,000 people signed the petition calling for the plans not to proceed. While the pause is welcome, I hope that when the Minister begins consulting parents, she becomes convinced that the extra year offers a special child the capacity to address issues that he or she has and that might not be addressed in primary education but that can be addressed, perhaps in a better way, in preschool education. As the Minister is aware, many children on the autism spectrum and with other special needs have specific language and learning difficulties. It may take them more time to catch up and realise their full potential. I have spoken to many parents who have been shocked. They work hard looking after their children. The idea that the special extra year that has been available to date would be removed and that a child with special needs might end up in primary school a year earlier is difficult to understand, given all of the planning that has gone into special provision and the fact that we were only recently able to guarantee - during the time that I was in government - that early care and preschool services would become available on a national basis to children with special needs. I hope that the consultation process will ensure an outcome that puts the needs of all of the children first and that those with special needs are supported in every way possible when starting school and throughout their journeys through the mainstream school system. Every child is different and policy has to reflect the needs of every child as well as his or her parents and families, who are obviously the ones who know that child best. The Minister accepted the recommendation of experts. Experts produce considerable advice and knowledge that is valuable, but they do not know the individual children. What has upset parents is the idea that the attention they have given their children somehow or other will play second fiddle to views of experts that, however well-intentioned, could in the parents' view result in a serious setback for their children, whom they believe need extra time.

As she knows, I have great respect for her. I hope that I will bring some clarity to the issue, which has been the subject of much commentary in recent weeks. Yesterday, I announced that I had paused a decision on this matter so that further consultation with parents could occur. This means that, for now at least, the over-age exemption will continue to be available. I hope that my decision will bring the parents concerned some relief. I encourage them to ensure that their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. I would appreciate receiving direct representations from parents. It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision. The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities. The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high-quality and inclusive primary school education. The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with them. Over-age exemptions were introduced at the outset of the ECCE programme in 2010. At that time, the programme only operated for one programme year of 38 weeks. For some children with special or additional needs, attending preschool five days per week was not feasible. For this reason, an allowance was made to enable them to split ECCE over two years. An example of this is a child who may have availed of three days ECCE provision per week in year one and two days per week in year two. The child's total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks. In order to facilitate this, and in cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE, which is five years and six months when finishing ECCE, an over-age exemption was approved. This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by six years of age. Children should be in school by the time they are six. The primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities. If children are not in school by six years of age, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. It does this by sending educational welfare inspectors out to the place of the child's education. This would be in addition to the early years inspectorate funded by my Department. Since ECCE was first introduced, my Department has worked to improve the preschool experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are an ECCE entitlement that will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018 and the introduction of the access and inclusion model, AIM. In the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the over-age exemption to the upper age limit of the programme. This was signalled last year but, in order to give longer notice, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018. The original decision to remove the over-age exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills. It was also done in close collaboration with members of the AIM cross-sectoral implementation group, including representatives from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the National Disability Authority and the HSE, representatives of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers. There was broad agreement that, in light of the developments in free preschool education and the supports in place for children in primary schools, the over-age exemption would no longer support the policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers. The decision acknowledged the supports provided by the relevant primary school, the NCSE and other bodies, as required. However, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns. To this end, I intend to pause the proposed change and consult more widely with parents of children with disabilities and special needs.

While she must address process, the critical issue is that many of the parents of children with special needs feel that they are being ignored, bypassed and not properly considered and included. The Government recently published a spending review from the Department of Finance on disability and expenditure related to special education. Where is the empathy, understanding or the desperation to try to make things better for families of precious children with special needs? When I came into the Department of Social Protection, there were major delays in getting monthly payments from the Department to parents of children with special needs. When the issue was re-examined with particular regard to children on the autism spectrum who, as the Minister is aware, constitute a significant proportion of children with special needs in schools, we had to consider the whole process, revamp it, redesign the forms, create an IT system and suspend applications for a couple of months. Since that process ended, I do not think any Member of the House has raised concerns about failures to give parents the payments to which they are entitled.

A child with special needs may not be ready to go to a mainstream primary school at or around five years of age, which is what many parents are worried about.

I believe we are on the same page. In her response she indicated that her greatest concern is the process which results in many parents feeling ignored and bypassed. I understand that. Parents in my own constituency feel that way. I am aware of the number of people who have signed the petition and who have been in touch with many Deputies. I appreciate the willingness of Deputy Burton to raise this issue now. My response is to say that it is important to consult parents. That is why I have paused. The overage exemption will continue for September 2018. We are currently planning how to engage in a meaningful consultation with interest groups and to place that in a dialogue with, as I said in my initial response, the evidence from which the experts made this recommendation to me. The experts involved not just those in my Department but also those from the Department of Education and Skills and the disability sector. I accept that expertise has to be placed in dialogue with consultation with parents. That is what I have done. In the past, the ECCE scheme comprised 38 weeks, which has now increased to 76. We have introduced the Better Start Access and Inclusion Model, AIM, which, as the Deputy knows, is an incredible support for children with special needs. I referred to the development of inclusive policies and practice in respect of the Department of Education and Skills, which has responsibility for this area. I accept all of the Deputy's points. I think we are on the same page. I have made a decision. I hope that in light of that consultation, we will come to the best policy possible.
